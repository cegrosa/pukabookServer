<text top="183" left="15" width="207" height="19" font="2"><b>Dear Constant Reader,</b></text>
<text top="222" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Life is a capricious business. The story which begins in this little book exists in this form because of a</text>
<text top="246" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">chance remark made by a realtor I have never met. This happened a year ago, on Long Island. Ralph</text>
<text top="270" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">Vicinanza, a long-time friend and business associate of mine (what he does mostly is to sell foreign</text>
<text top="294" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">publishing rights for books and stories), had just rented a house there. The realtor remarked that the</text>
<text top="318" left="15" width="550" height="19" font="3">house &#34;looked like something out of a story by Charles Dickens.&#34;</text>
<text top="357" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">The remark was still on Ralph's mind when he welcomed his first houseguest, British publisher Malcolm</text>
<text top="381" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Edwards. He repeated it to Edwards, and they began chatting about Dickens. Edwards mentioned that</text>
<text top="405" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Dickens had published many of his novels in installments, either folded into magazines or by themselves</text>
<text top="429" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">as chapbooks, (I don't know the origin of this word, meaning a smaller-than-average book, but have</text>
<text top="453" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">always loved its air of intimacy and friendliness). Some of the novels, Edwards added, were actually</text>
<text top="477" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">written and revised in the shadow of publication; Charles Dickens was one novelist apparently not afraid</text>
<text top="501" left="15" width="114" height="19" font="3">of a deadline.</text>
<text top="540" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Dickens's serialized novels were immensely popular; so popular, in fact, that one of them precipitated a</text>
<text top="564" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">tragedy in Baltimore. A large group of Dickens fans crowded onto a waterfront dock, anticipating the</text>
<text top="588" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">arrival of an English ship with copies of the final installment of <i>The Old Curiosity Shop</i> on board.</text>
<text top="612" left="15" width="756" height="19" font="3">According to the story, several would-be readers were jostled into the water and drowned.</text>
<text top="651" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I don't think either Malcolm. or Ralph wanted anyone drowned, but they were curious as to what would</text>
<text top="675" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">happen if serial publication were tried again today. Neither was immediately aware that it has happened</text>
<text top="699" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">(there really is nothing new under the sun) on at least two occasions. Tom Wolfe published the first draft</text>
<text top="723" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">of his novel <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i> serially in <i>Rolling Stone </i>magazine, and Michael McDowell <i>(The</i></text>
<text top="747" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="4"><i>Amulet, Gilded Needles, The Elementals,</i> and the screenplay <i>Beetlejuice)</i> published a novel called</text>
<text top="771" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="4"><i>Blackwater</i> in paperback installments. That novel - a horror story about a Southern family with the</text>
<text top="795" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">unpleasant familial trait of turning into alligators - was not McDowell's best, but enjoyed good success</text>
<text top="819" left="15" width="251" height="19" font="3">for Avon Books, all the same.</text>
<text top="858" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">The two men further speculated about what might happen if a writer of popular fiction were to try issuing</text>
<text top="882" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">a novel in chapbook editions today - little paperbacks that might sell for a pound or two in Britain, or</text>
<text top="906" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">perhaps three dollars in America (where most paperbacks now sell for $6.99 or $7.99). Someone like</text>
<text top="930" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Stephen King might make an interesting go of such an experiment, Malcolm said, and from there the</text>
<text top="954" left="15" width="327" height="19" font="3">conversation moved on to other topics.</text>
<text top="993" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Ralph more or less forgot the idea, but it recurred to him in the fall of 1995, following his return from the</text>
<text top="1017" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">Frankfurt Book Fair, a kind of international trade show where every day is a showdown for foreign</text>
<text top="1041" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">agents like Ralph. He broached the serialization/ chapbook idea to me along with a number of other</text>
<text top="1065" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">matters, most of which were automatic turndowns.</text>
<text top="1104" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">The chapbook idea was not an automatic turndown, though; unlike the interview in the Japanese Playboy</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">or the all-expenses-paid tour of the Baltic Republics, it struck a bright spark in my imagination. I don't</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">think that I am a modern Dickens-if such a person exists, it is probably John Irving or Salman Rushdie -</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">but I have always loved stories told in episodes. It is a format I first encountered in <i>The Saturday Evening</i></text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="4"><i>Post,</i> and I liked it because the end of each episode made the reader an almost equal participant with the</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">writer-you had a whole week to try to figure out the next twist of the snake. Also, one read and</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">experienced these stories more <i>intensely,</i> it seemed to me, because they were rationed. You couldn't gulp,</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="492" height="19" font="3">even if you wanted to (and if the story was good, you did).</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Best of all, in my house we often read them aloud-my brother, David, one night, myself the next, my</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">mother taking a turn on the third, then back to my brother again. It was a rare chance to enjoy a written</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">work as we enjoyed the movies we went to and the TV programs <i>(Rawhide, Bonanza. Route 66)</i> that we</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">watched together; they were a family event . It wasn't until years later that I discovered Dickens's novels</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">had been enjoyed by families of his day in much the same fashion. only their fireside agonizings over the</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">fate of Pip and Oliver and David Copperfield went on for years instead of a couple of months (even the</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="610" height="19" font="3">longest of the <i>Post</i> serials rarely ran much more than eight installments).</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">There was one other thing that I liked about the idea, an appeal that I suspect only the writer of suspense</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">tales and spooky stories can fully appreciate: in a story which is published m installments, the writer</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">gains an ascendancy over the reader which he or she cannot otherwise enjoy: simply put. Constant</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="504" height="19" font="3">Reader, you cannot flip ahead and see how matters turn out.</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">I still remember walking into our living room once when I was twelve or so and seeing my mother in her</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">favorite rocker, peeking at the end of an Agatha Christie paperback while her finger held her actual place</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">around page 50. I was appalled, and told her so Q was twelve. remember. an age at which boys first</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">dimly begin to realize that they know everything), suggesting that reading the end of a mystery novel</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">before you actually get there was on a par with eating the white stuff out of the middle of Oreo cookies</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">and then throwing the cookies themselves away. She laughed her wonderful unembarrassed laugh and</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">said perhaps that was so, but sometimes she just couldn't resist the temptation. Giving in to temptation</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">was a concept I could understand; I had plenty of my own, even at twelve. But here, at last, is an amusing</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">cure for that temptation. Until the final episode arrives in bookstores, no one is going to know how <i>The</i></text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="414" height="19" font="4"><i>Green Mile</i> turns out ... and that may include me.</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Although there was no way he could have known it, Ralph Vicinanza, mentioned the idea of a novel in</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">installments at what was, for me, the perfect psychological moment. I had been playing with a story idea</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">on a subject I had always suspected I would get around to sooner or later: the electric chair. &#34;Old Sparky&#34;</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">has fascinated me ever since my first James Cagney movie, and the first Death Row tales I ever read (in a</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">book called <i>Twenty Thousand </i>Years <i>in Sing Sing,</i> written by Warden Lewis E. Lawes) fired the darker</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">side of my imagination. What, I wondered, would it be like to walk those last forty yards to the electric</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">chair, knowing you were going to die there? Mat, for that matter, would it be like to be the man who had</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">to strap the condemned in ... or pull the switch? What would such a job take out of you? Even creepier,</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="157" height="19" font="3">what might it add?</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">I had tried these basic ideas, always tentatively, on a number of different frameworks over the last twenty</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">or thirty years. I had written one successful novella set in prison <i>(Rita Hayworth and Shawshank</i></text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="4"><i>Redemption),</i> and had sort of come to the conclusion that that was probably it for me, when this take on</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">the idea came along. There were lots of things I liked about it, but nothing more than the narrator's</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">essentially decent voice; low-key, honest, perhaps a little wide-eyed, he is a Stephen King narrator if ever</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">there was one. So I got to work, but in a tentative, stopand-start way. Most of the second chapter was</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="366" height="19" font="3">written during a rain delay at Fenway Park!</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">When Ralph called, I had filled a notebook with scribbled pages of <i>The Green Mile,</i> and realized I was</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">building a novel when I should have been spending my time clearing my desk for revisions on a book</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">already written <i>(Desperation-you'll</i> see it soon, Constant Reader). At the point I had come to on <i>Mile,</i></text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">there are usually just two choices: put it away (probably never to be picked up again) or cast everything</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="174" height="19" font="3">else aside and chase.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">Ralph suggested a possible third alternative, a story that could be written the same way it would be</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">read-in installments. And I liked the high-wire aspect of it, too: fall down on the job, fail to carry</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">through, and all at once about a million readers are howling for your blood. No one knows this any better</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">than me, unless it's my secretary, Juliann Eugley; we get dozens of angry letters each week, demanding</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the next book in the <i>Dark Tower</i> cycle (patience, followers of Roland; another year or so and your wait</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">will end, I promise). One of these contained a Polaroid of a teddy-bear in chains, with a message cut out</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">of newspaper headlines and magazine covers: RELEASE THE NEXT <i>DARK TOWER </i>BOOK AT ONCE</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">OR THE BEAR DIES, it said. I put it up in my office to remind myself both of my responsibility and of</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">how wonderful it is to have people actually care - a little-about the creatures of one's imagination.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="753" height="19" font="3">In any case, I've decided to publish <i>The Green Mile</i> in a series of small paperbacks, in the</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">nineteenthcentury manner, and I hope you'll write and tell me (a) if you liked the story, and (b) if you</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">liked the seldom used but rather amusing delivery system. It has certainly energized the writing of the</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">story, although at this moment (a rainy evening in October of 1995) it is still far from done, even in</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">rough draft, and the outcome remains in some doubt. That is part of the excitement of the whole thing,</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="745" height="19" font="3">though-at this point I'm driving through thick fog with the pedal all the way to the metal.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Most of all, I want to say that if you have even half as much fun reading this as I did writing it, we'll both</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">be well off. Enjoy ... and why not read this aloud, with a friend? If nothing else, it will shorten the time</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="669" height="19" font="3">until the next installment appears on your newsstand or in your local bookstore.</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="466" height="19" font="3">In the meantime, take care, and be good to one another.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">them but can't be gotten away from. They called it Old Sparky, or the Big Juicy. They made cracks about</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">the power bill, and how Warden Moores would cook his Thanksgiving dinner that fall, with his wife,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="219" height="19" font="3">Melinda, too sick to cook.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">But for the ones who actually had to sit down in that chair, the humor went out of the situation in a hurry.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I presided over seventy-eight executions during my time at Cold Mountain (that's one figure I've never</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">been confused about; I'll remember it on my deathbed), and I think that, for most of those men, the truth</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">of what was happening to them finally hit all the way home when their ankles were being clamped to the</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">stout oak of &#34;Old Sparky's&#34; legs. The realization came then (you would see it rising in their eyes, a kind</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">of cold dismay) that their own legs had finished their careers. The blood still ran in them, the muscles</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">were still strong, but they were finished, all the same; they were never going to walk another country</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">mile or dance with a girl at a barn-raising. Old Sparky's clients came to a knowledge of their deaths from</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">the ankles up. There was a black silk bag that went over their heads after they had finished their rambling</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">and mostly disjointed last remarks. It was supposed to be for them, but I always thought: it was really for</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">us, to keep us from seeing the awful tide of dismay in their eyes as they realized they were going to die</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="181" height="19" font="3">with their knees bent.</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">There was no death row at Cold Mountain, only E Block, set apart from the other four and about a</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">quarter their size, brick instead of wood, with a horrible bare metal roof that glared in the summer sun</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">like a delirious eyeball. Six cells inside, three on each side of a wide center aisle, each almost twice as</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">big as the cells in the other four blocks. Singles, too. Great accommodations for a prison (especially in</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">the thirties), but the inmates would have traded for cells in any of the other four. Believe me, they would</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="103" height="19" font="3">have traded.</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">There was never a time during my years as block superintendent when all six cells were occupied at one</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">time-thank God for small favors. Four was the most, mixed black and white (at Cold Mountain, there was</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">no segregation among the walking dead), and that was a little piece of hell. One was a woman, Beverly</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">McCall. She was black as the ace of spades and as beautiful as the sin you never had nerve enough to</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">commit. She put up with six years of her husband beating her, but wouldn't put up with his creeping</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">around for a single day. On the evening after she found out he was cheating, she stood waiting for the</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">unfortunate Lester McCall, known to his pals (and, presumably, to his extremely short-term mistress) as</text>

<text top="776" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">overcoat half off, then dropped his cheating guts onto his two-tone shoes. Used one of Cutter's own</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">razors to do it. Two nights before she was due to sit in Old Sparky, she called me to her cell and said she</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">had been visited by her African spirit-father in a dream. He told her to discard her slave-name and to die</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">under her free name, Matuomi. That was her request, that her death warrant should be read under the</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">name of Beverly Matuomi. I guess her spirit-father didn't give her any first name, or one she could make</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">out, anyhow. I said yes, okay, fine. One thing those years serving as the bull-goose screw taught me was</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">never to refuse the condemned unless I absolutely had to. In the case of Beverly Matuomi, it made no</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">difference anyway. The governor called the next day around three in the afternoon, commuting her</text>

<text top="203" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">you've spent as much time minding murderers as I did. There was only one time I ever had a question</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="556" height="19" font="3">about the nature of my job. That, I reckon, is why I'm writing this.</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">The wide corridor up the center of E Block was floored with linoleum the color of tired old limes, and so</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">what was called the Last Mile at other prisons was called the Green Mile at Cold Mountain. It ran, I</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">guess, sixty long paces from south to north, bottom to top. At the bottom was the restraint room. At the</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">top end was a T-junction. A left turn meant life-if you called what went on in the sunbaked exercise yard</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">life, and many did; many lived it for years, with no apparent ill effects. Thieves and arsonists and sex</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="697" height="19" font="3">criminals, all talking their talk and walking their walk and making their little deals.</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">A right turn, though - that was different. First you went into my office (where the carpet was also green,</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">a thing I kept meaning to change and not getting around to), and crossed in front of my desk, which was</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">flanked by the American flag on the left and the state flag on the right. On the far side were two doors.</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">One led into the small W.C. that I and the Block E guards (sometimes even Warden Moores) used; the</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">other opened on a kind of storage shed. This was where you ended up when you walked the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">It was a small door - I had to duck my head when I went through, and John Coffey actually had to sit and</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">scoot. You came out on a little landing, then went down three cement steps to a board floor. It was a</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">miserable room without heat and with a metal roof, just like the one on the block to which it was an</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">adjunct. It was cold enough in there to see your breath during the winter, and stifling in the summer. At</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">the execution of Elmer Manfred - in July or August of '30, that one was, I believe-we had nine witnesses</text>

<text top="719" left="15" width="775" height="19" font="3">On the left side of the storage shed - again - there was life. Tools (all locked down in frames</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">criss-crossed with chains, as if they were carbine rifles instead of spades and pickaxes), dry goods, sacks</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">of seeds for spring planting in the prison gardens, boxes of toilet paper, pallets cross-loaded with blanks</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">for the prison plate-shop... even bags of lime for marking out the baseball diamond and the football</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">gridiron - the cons played in what was known as The Pasture, and fall afternoons were greatly looked</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="247" height="19" font="3">forward to at Cold Mountain.</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">On the right - once again - death. Old Sparky his ownself, sitting up on a plank platform at the southeast</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">corner of the store room, stout oak legs, broad oak arms that had absorbed the terrorized sweat of scores</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">of men in the last few minutes of their lives, and the metal cap, usually hung jauntily on the back of the</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">chair, like some robot kid's beanie in a Buck Rogers comic-strip. A cord ran from it and through a</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">gasket-circled hole in the cinderblock wall behind the chair. Off to one side was a galvanized tin bucket.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">If you looked inside it, you would see a circle of sponge, cut just right to fit the metal cap. Before</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">executions, it was soaked in brine to better conduct the charge of direct-current electricity that ran</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="629" height="19" font="3">through the wire, through the sponge, and into the condemned man's brain.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">1932 was the year of John Coffey. The details would be in the papers, still there for anyone who cared</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">enough to look them out - someone with more energy than one very old man whittling away the end of</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="374" height="19" font="3">his life in a Georgia nursing home. That was</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">a hot fall, I remember that; very hot, indeed. October almost like August, and the warden's wife, Melinda,</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">up in the hospital at Indianola for a spell. It was the fall I had the worst urinary infection of my life, not</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">bad enough to put me in the hospital myself, but almost bad enough for me to wish I was dead every time</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">I took a leak. It was the fall of Delacroix, the little half-bald Frenchman with the mouse, the one that</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">came in the summer and did that cute trick with the spool. Mostly, though, it was the fall that John</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="731" height="19" font="3">Coffey came to E Block, sentenced to death for the rape-murder of the Detterick twins.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">There were four or five guards on the block each shift, but a lot of them were floaters. Dean Stanton,</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger, and Brutus Howell (the men called him &#34;Brutal,&#34; but it was a joke, he wouldn't hurt a</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">fly unless he had to, in spite of his size) are all dead now, and so is Percy Wetmore, who really was</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">brutal ... not to mention stupid. Percy had no business on E Block, where an ugly nature was useless and</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="738" height="19" font="3">sometimes dangerous, but he was related to the governor by marriage, and so he stayed.</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">It was Percy Wetmore who ushered Coffey onto the block, with the supposedly traditional cry of &#34;Dead</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="337" height="19" font="3">man walking! Dead man walking here!&#34;</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">It was still as hot as the hinges of hell, October or not. The door to the exercise yard opened, letting in a</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">flood of brilliant light and the biggest man I've ever seen, except for some of the basketball fellows they</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">have on the TV down in the &#34;Resource Room&#34; of this home for wayward droolers I've finished up in. He</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">wore chains on his arms and across his water-barrel of a chest; he wore legirons on his ankles and</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">shuffled a chain between them that sounded like cascading coins as it ran along the lime - colored</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">corridor between the cells. Percy Wetmore was on one side of him, skinny little Harry Terwilliger was on</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">the other, and they looked like children walking along with a captured bear. Even Brutus Howell looked</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">like a kid next to Coffey, and Brutal was over six feet tall and broad as well, a football tackle who had</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="662" height="19" font="3">gone on to play at LSU until he flunked out and came back home to the ridges.</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">John Coffey was black, like most of the men who came to stay for awhile in E Block before dying in Old</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Sparky's lap, and he stood six feet, eight inches tall. He wasn't all willowy like the TV basketball fellows,</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">though - he was broad in the shoulders and deep through the chest, laced over with muscle in every</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">direction. They'd put him in the biggest denims they could find in Stores, and still the cuffs of the pants</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">rode halfway up on his bunched and scarred calves. The shirt was open to below his chest, and the</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">sleeves stopped somewhere on his forearms. He was holding his cap in one huge hand, which was just as</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">well; perched on his bald mahogany ball of a head, it would have looked like the kind of cap an</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">organgrinder's monkey wears, only blue instead of red. He looked like he could have snapped the chains</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">that held him as easily as you might snap the ribbons on a Christmas present, but when you looked in his</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">face, you knew he wasn't going to do anything like that. It wasn't dull-although that was what Percy</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">thought, it wasn't long before Percy was calling him the ijit - but lost. He kept looking around as if to</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">make out where he was. Maybe even who he was. My first thought was that he looked like a black</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Samson ... only after Delilah had shaved him smooth as her faithless little hand and taken all the fun out</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">of him.</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dead man walking!&#34; Percy trumpeted, hauling on that bear of a man's wristcuff, as if he really believed</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">he could move him if Coffey decided he didn't want to move anymore on his own. Harry didn't say</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="445" height="19" font="3">anything, but he looked embarrassed. &#34;Dead man---!'</text>

<page number="7" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">'That'll be enough of that,&#34; I said. I was in what was going to be Coffey's cell, sitting on his bunk. I'd</text>
<text top="71" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">known he was coming, of course, was there to welcome him and take charge of him, but had no idea of</text>
<text top="95" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">the man's pure size until I saw him. Percy gave me a look that said we all knew I was an asshole (except</text>
<text top="119" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">for the big dummy, of course, who only knew how to rape and murder little girls), but he didn't say</text>
<text top="143" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">anything.</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">The three of them stopped outside the cell door, which was standing open on its track. I nodded to Harry,</text>
<text top="206" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">who said: &#34;Are you sure you want to be in there with him, boss?&#34; I didn't often hear Harry Terwilliger</text>
<text top="230" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">sound nervous - he'd been right there by my side during the riots of six or seven years before and had</text>
<text top="254" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">never wavered, even when the rumors that some of them had guns began to circulate - but he sounded</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="113" height="19" font="3">nervous then.</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Am I going to have any trouble with you, big boy?&#34; I asked, sitting there on the bunk and trying not to</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">look or sound as miserable as I felt-that urinary infection I mentioned earlier wasn't as bad as it</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">eventually got, but it was no day at the beach, let me tell you.</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Coffey shook his head slowly - once to the left, once to the right, then back to dead center. Once his eyes</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">found me, they never left me.</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Harry had a clipboard with Coffey's forms on it in one hand. &#34;Give it to him,&#34; I said to Harry &#34;Put it in</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="84" height="19" font="3">his hand.&#34;</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="422" height="19" font="3">Harry did. The big mutt took it like a sleepwalker.</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;Now bring it to me, big boy,&#34; I said, and Coffey did, his chains jingling and rattling. He had to duck his</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="216" height="19" font="3">head just to enter the cell.</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">I looked up and down mostly to register his height as a fact and not an optical illusion. It was real: six</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">feet, eight inches. His weight was given as two-eighty, but I think that was only an estimate; he had to</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">have been three hundred and twenty, maybe as much as three hundred and fifty pounds. Under the space</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">for scars and identifying marks, one word had been blocked out in the laborious printing of Magnusson,</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="343" height="19" font="3">the old trusty in Registration: <i>Numerous.</i></text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I looked up. Coffey had shuffled a bit to one side and I could see Harry standing across the corridor in</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">front of Delacroix's cell - he was our only other prisoner in E Block when Coffey came in. Del was a</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">slight, balding man with the worried face of an accountant who knows his embezzlement will soon be</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="471" height="19" font="3">discovered. His tame mouse was sitting on his shoulder.</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore was leaning in the doorway of the cell which had just become John Coffey's. He had</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">taken his hickory baton out of the custom-made holster he carried it in, and was tapping it against one</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">palm the way a man does when he has a toy he wants to use. And all at once I couldn't stand to have him</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">there. Maybe it was the unseasonable heat, maybe it was the urinary infection heating up my groin and</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">making the itch of my flannel underwear all but unbearable, maybe it was knowing that the state had sent</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">me a black man next door to an idiot to execute, and Percy clearly wanted to hand-tool him a little first.</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Probably it was all those things. Whatever it was, I stopped caring about his political connections for a</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="96" height="19" font="3">little while.</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="521" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy.&#34; I said. &#34;They're moving house over in the infirmary.&#34;</text>

<text top="137" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">ones - a combination of lug and goon. He resented the big ones. He wasn't skinny, like Harry Terwilliger,</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">but he was short. A banty-rooster sort of guy, the kind that likes to pick fights, especially when the odds</text>

<text top="224" left="15" width="501" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then your job is done,&#34; I said. &#34;Get over to the infirmary.&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">His lower lip pooched out. Bill Dodge and his men were moving boxes and stacks of sheets, even the</text>

<text top="311" left="15" width="513" height="19" font="3">work, heavy lifting. Percy Wetmore wanted no part of either.</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="352" height="19" font="3">&#34;They got all the men they need,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then get over there and straw-boss,&#34; I said, raising my voice. I saw Harry wince and paid no attention.</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">If the governor ordered Warden Moores to fire me for ruffling the wrong set of feathers, who was Hal</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Moores going to put in my place? Percy? It was a joke. &#34;I really don't care what you do, Percy, as long as</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="260" height="19" font="3">you get out of here for awhile!'</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">For a moment I thought he was going to stick and there'd be real trouble, with Coffey standing there the</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">whole time like the world's biggest stopped clock. Then Percy rammed his billy back into its hand-tooled</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">holster-foolish damned vanitorious thing - and went stalking up the corridor. I don't remember which</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">guard was sitting at the duty desk that day-one of the floaters, I guess - but Percy must not have liked the</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">way he looked, because he growled, &#34;You wipe that smirk off your shitepoke face or I'll wipe it off for</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">you&#34; as he went by. There was a rattle of keys, a momentary blast of hot sunlight from the exercise yard,</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">and then Percy Wetmore was gone, at least for the time being. Delacroix's mouse ran back and forth from</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="706" height="19" font="3">one of the little Frenchman's shoulders to the other, his filament whiskers twitching.</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">&#34;Be still, Mr. Jingles,&#34; Delacroix said, and the mouse stopped on his left shoulder just as if he had</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">understood. &#34;Just be so still and so quiet.&#34; In Delacroix's lilting Cajun accent, <i>quiet</i> came out sounding</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="226" height="19" font="3">exotic and <i>foreign - kwaht.</i></text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">&#34;You go lie down, Del,&#34; I said curtly. &#34;Take you a rest. This is none of your business, either!'</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">He did as I said. He had raped a young girl and killed her, and had then dropped her body behind the</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">apartment house where she lived, doused it with coal-oil, and then set it on fire, hoping in some muddled</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">way to dispose of the evidence of his crime. The fire had spread to the building itself, had engulfed it,</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">and six more people had died, two of them children. It was the only crime he had in him, and now he was</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">just a mild-mannered man with a worried face, a bald pate, and long hair straggling over the back of his</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">shirt-collar. He would sit down with Old Sparky in a little while, and Old Sparky would make an end to</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">him ... but whatever it was that had done that awful thing was already gone, and now he lay on his bunk,</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">letting his little companion run squeaking over his hands. In a way, that was the worst; Old Sparky never</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">burned what was inside them, and the drugs they inject them with today don't put it to sleep. It vacates,</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="684" height="19" font="3">jumps to someone else, and leaves us to kill husks that aren't really alive anyway.</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="282" height="19" font="3">I turned my attention to the giant.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="561" height="19" font="3">&#34;If I let Harry take those chains off you, are you going to be nice?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">He nodded. It was like his head-shake: down , up, back to center. His strange eyes looked at me. There</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">was a kind of peace in them, but not a kind I was sure I could trust. I crooked a finger to Harry, who</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">came in and unlocked the chains. He showed no fear now, even when he knelt between Coffey's</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">treetrunk legs to unlock the ankle irons, and that eased me some. It was Percy who had made Harry</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">nervous, and I trusted Harry's instincts. I trusted the instincts of all my day-to-day E Block men, except</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="83" height="19" font="3">for Percy.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I have a little set speech I make to men new on the block, but I hesitated with Coffey, because he seemed</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="306" height="19" font="3">so abnormal, and not just in his size.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">When Harry stood back (Coffey had remained motionless during the entire unlocking ceremony, as</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">placid as a Percheron), I looked up at my new charge, tapping on the clipboard with my thumb, and said:</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">&#34;Can you talk, big boy?&#34;</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir, boss, I can talk,&#34; he said. His voice was a deep and quiet rumble. It made me think of a freshly</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">tuned tractor engine. He had no real Southern drawl-he said I, not Ah-but there was a kind of Southern</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">construction to his speech that I noticed later. As if he was from the South, but not of it. He didn't sound</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">illiterate, but he didn't sound educated. In his speech as in so many other things, he was a mystery.</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Mostly it was his eyes that troubled me - a kind of peaceful absence in them, as if he were floating far,</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="78" height="19" font="3">far away.</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="244" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your name is John Coffey.&#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir, boss, like the drink only not spelled the same way.&#34;</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">&#34;So you can spell, can you? Read and write?&#34;</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="336" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just my name, boss,&#34; said he, serenely.</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">I sighed, then gave him a short version of my set speech. I'd already decided he wasn't going to be any</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="362" height="19" font="3">trouble. In that I was both right and wrong.</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;My name is Paul Edgecombe,&#34; I said. &#34;I'm the E Block super - the head screw. You want something</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">from me, ask for me by name. If I'm not here, ask this other, man - his name is Harry Terwilliger. Or you</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="514" height="19" font="3">ask for Mr. Stanton or Mr. Howell. Do you understand that?&#34;</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="131" height="19" font="3">Coffey nodded.</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just don't expect to get what you want unless we decide it's what you need - this isn't a hotel. Still with</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="44" height="19" font="3">me?&#34;</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="148" height="19" font="3">He nodded again.</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;This is a quiet place, big boy - not like the rest of the prison. It's just you and Delacroix over there. You</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">won't work; mostly you'll just sit. Give you a chance to think things over.&#34; Too much time for most of</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="790" height="19" font="3">them, but I didn't say that. &#34;Sometimes we play the radio, if all's in order. You like the radio?&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">He nodded, but doubtfully, as if he wasn't sure what the radio was. I later found out that was true, in a</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">way; Coffey knew things when he encountered them again, but in between he forgot. He knew the</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">characters on Our <i>Gal Sunday, </i>but had only the haziest memory of what they'd been up to the last time.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;If you behave, you'll eat on time, you'll never see the solitary cell down at the far end, or have to wear</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">one of those canvas coats that buttons up the back. You'll have two hours in the yard afternoons from</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">four until six, except on Saturdays when the rest of the prison population has their flag football games.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">You'll have your visitors on Sunday afternoons, if you have someone who wants to visit you. Do you,</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">Coffey?&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="382" height="19" font="3">He shook his head. &#34;Got none, boss,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="213" height="19" font="3">'Well, your lawyer, then!'</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">&#34;I believe I've seen the back end of him,&#34; he said. &#34;He was give to me on loan. Don't believe he could</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="327" height="19" font="3">find his way up here in the mountains!'</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">I looked at him closely to see if he might be trying a little joke, but he didn't seem to be. And I really</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">hadn't expected any different. Appeals weren't for the likes of John Coffey, not back then; they had their</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">day in court and then the world forgot them until they saw a squib in the paper saying a certain fellow</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">had taken a little electricity along about midnight. But a man with a wife, children, or friends to look</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">forward to on Sunday afternoons was easier to control, if control looked to be a problem. Here it didn't,</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="429" height="19" font="3">and that was good. Because he was so damned big.</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">I shifted a little on the bunk, then decided I might feel a little more comfortable in my nether parts if I</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">stood up, and so I did. He backed away from me respectfully, and clasped his hands in front of him.</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your time here can be easy or hard, big boy, it all depends on you. I'm here to say you might as well</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">make it easy on all of us, because it comes to the same in the end. We'll treat you as right as you deserve.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="245" height="19" font="3">Do you have any questions?&#34;</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do you leave a light on after bedtime?&#34; he asked right away, as if he had only been waiting for the</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">chance.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I blinked at him. I had been asked a lot of strange questions by newcomers to E Block - once about the</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="336" height="19" font="3">size of my wife's tits-but never that one.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Coffey was smiling a trifle uneasily, as if he knew we would think him foolish but couldn't help himself.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="713" height="19" font="3">&#34;Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes,&#34; he said. &#34;If it's a strange place.&#34;</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I looked at him - the pure size of him - and felt strangely touched. They did touch you, you know; you</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="687" height="19" font="3">didn't see them at their worst, hammering out their horrors like demons at a forge.</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, it's pretty bright in here all night long,&#34; I said. &#34;Half the lights along the Mile burn from nine until</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">five every morning.&#34; Then I realized he wouldn't have any idea of what I was talking about - he didn't</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="675" height="19" font="3">know the Green Mile from Mississippi mud - and so I pointed. &#34;In the corridor.&#34;</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">He nodded, relieved. I'm not sure he knew what a corridor was, either, but he could see the 200-watt</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="211" height="19" font="3">bulbs in their wire cages.</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I did something I'd never done to a prisoner before, then - I offered him my hand. Even now I don't know</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">why. Him asking about the lights, maybe. It made Harry Terwilliger blink, I can tell you that. Coffey</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">took my hand with surprising gentleness, my hand all but disappearing into his, and that was all of it. I</text>

<page number="11" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="451" height="19" font="3">had another moth in my killing bottle. We were done.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I stepped out of the cell. Harry pulled the door shut on its track and ran both locks. Coffey stood where</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">he was a moment or two longer, as if he didn't know what to do next, and then he sat down on his bunk,</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">clasped his giant's hands between his knees, and lowered his head like a man who grieves or prays. He</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">said something then in his strange, almost Southern voice. I heard it with perfect clarity, and although I</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">didn't know much about what he'd done then - you don't need to know about what a man's done in order</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">to feed him and groom him until it's time for him to pay off what he owes - it still gave me a chill.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="638" height="19" font="3">&#34;I couldn't help-it, boss,&#34; he said. &#34;I tried to take it back, but it was too late!'</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>3.</b></text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're going to have you some trouble with Percy,&#34; Harry said as we walked back up the hall and into</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">my office. Dean Stanton, sort of my third in command - we didn't actually have such things, a situation</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore would have fixed up in a flash - was sitting behind my desk, updating the files, a job I</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">never seemed to get around to. He barely looked up as we came in, just gave his little glasses a shove</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="517" height="19" font="3">with the ball of his thumb and dived back into his paperwork.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;I been having trouble with that peckerwood since the day he came here,&#34; I said, gingerly, pulling my</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">pants away from my crotch and wincing. &#34;Did you hear what he was shouting when he brought that big</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="122" height="19" font="3">galoot down?&#34;</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="522" height="19" font="3">&#34;Couldn't very well not,&#34; Harry said. &#34;I was there, you know.&#34;</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;I was in the john and heard it just fine,&#34; Dean said. He drew a sheet of paper to him, held it up into the</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">light so I could see there was a coffee-ring as well as typing on it, and then tossed it into the waste</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="792" height="19" font="3">basket. 'Dead man walking.' Must have read that in one of those magazines he likes so much!&#34;</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">And he probably had. Percy Wetmore was a great reader of <i>Argosy</i> and <i>Stag</i> and <i>Men's Adventure.</i> There</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">was a prison tale in every issue, it seemed, and Percy read them avidly, like a man doing research. It was</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">like he was trying to find out how to act, and thought the information was in those magazines. He'd come</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">just after we did Anthony Ray, the hatchet-killer - and he hadn't actually participated in an execution yet,</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="430" height="19" font="3">although he'd witnessed one from the switch-room.</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;He knows people,&#34; Harry said. &#34;He's connected. You'll have to answer for sending him off the block,</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="668" height="19" font="3">and you'll have to answer even harder for expecting him to do some real work.&#34;</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't expect it,&#34; I said, and I didn't ... but I had hopes. Bill Dodge wasn't the sort to let a man just stand</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">around and do the heavy looking-on. &#34;I'm more interested in the big boy, for the time being. Are we</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="277" height="19" font="3">going to have trouble with him?&#34;</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="302" height="19" font="3">Harry shook his head with decision.</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;He was quiet as a lamb at court down there in Trapingus County,&#34; Dean said. He took his little rimless</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">glasses off and began to polish them on his vest. &#34;Of course they had more chains on him than Scrooge</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="793" height="19" font="3">saw on Marley's ghost, but he could have kicked up dickens if he'd wanted. That's a pun, son.&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="726" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know,&#34; I said, although I didn't. I just hate letting Dean Stanton get the better of me.</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="257" height="19" font="3">&#34;Big one, ain't he?&#34; Dean said.</text>

<text top="125" left="15" width="665" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't worry about Old Sparky,&#34; I said absently. &#34;He makes the big 'uns little.&#34;</text>
<text top="164" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Dean pinched the sides of his nose, where there were a couple of angry red patches from his glasses, and</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="454" height="19" font="3">nodded. &#34;Yep,&#34; he said. &#34;Some truth to that, all right.&#34;</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I asked, &#34;Do either of you know where he came from before he showed up in ... Tefton? It was Tefton,</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="88" height="19" font="3">wasn't it?&#34;</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Tefton, down in Trapingus County. Before he showed up there and did what he did,</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">no one seems to know. He just drifted around, I guess. You might be able to find out a little more from</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">the newspapers in the prison library, if you're really interested. They probably won't get around to</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">moving those until next week.&#34; He grinned. &#34;You might have to listen to your little buddy bitching and</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="227" height="19" font="3">moaning upstairs, though.&#34;</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="659" height="19" font="3">&#34;I might just go have a peek, anyway,&#34; I said, and later on that afternoon I did.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">The prison library was in back of the building that was going to become the prison auto shop - at least</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">that was the plan. More pork in someone's pocket was what I thought, but the Depression was on, and I</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">kept my opinions to myself - the way I should have kept my mouth shut about Percy, but sometimes a</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">man just can't keep it clapped tight. A man's mouth gets him in more trouble than his pecker ever could,</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">most of the time. And the auto shop never happened, anyway - the next spring, the prison moved sixty</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">miles down the road to Brighton. More backroom deals, I reckon. More barrels of pork. Wasn't nothing</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="53" height="19" font="3">to me.</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Administration had gone to a new building on the east side of the yard; the infirmary was being moved</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">(whose country-bumpkin idea it had been to put an infirmary on the second floor in the first place was</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">just another of life's mysteries); the library was still partly stocked - not that it ever had much in it - and</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">standing empty. The old building was a hot clapboard box kind of shouldered in between A and B</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Blocks. Their bathrooms backed up on it and the whole building was always swimming with this vague</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">pissy smell, which was probably the only good reason for the move. The library was L-shaped, and not</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">much bigger than my office. I looked for a fan, but they were all gone. It must have been a hundred</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">degrees in there, and I could feel that hot throb in my groin when I sat down. Sort of like an infected</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">tooth. I know that's absurd, considering the region we're talking about here, but it's the only thing I could</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">compare it to. It got a lot worse during and just after taking a leak, which I had done just before walking</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="43" height="19" font="3">over.</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">There was one other fellow there after all - a scrawny old trusty named Gibbons dozing away in the</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">corner with a Wild West novel in his lap and his hat pulled down over his eyes. The heat wasn't</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">bothering him, nor were the grunts, thumps, and occasional curses from the infirmary upstairs (where it</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">had to be at least ten degrees hotter, and I hoped Percy Wetmore was enjoying it). I didn't bother him,</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">either, but went around to the short side of the L, where the newspapers were kept. I thought they might</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">be gone along with the fans, in spite of what Dean had said. They weren't, though, and the business about</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">the Detterick twins was easily enough looked out; it had been front-page news from the commission of</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="589" height="19" font="3">the crime in June right through the trial in late August and September.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">Soon I had forgotten the heat and the thumps from upstairs and old Gibbons's wheezy snores. The</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">thought of those little nine-year-old girls - their fluffy heads of blonde hair and their engaging Bobbsey</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Twins smiles - in connection with Coffey's hulking darkness was unpleasant but impossible to ignore.</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Given his size, it was easy to imagine him actually eating them, like a giant in a fairy tale. What he <i>had</i></text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">done was even worse, and it was a lucky thing for him that he hadn't just been lynched right there on the</text>

<text top="233" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">King Cotton had been deposed in the South seventy years before all these things happened and would</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">never be king again, but in those years of the thirties it had a little revival. There were no more cotton</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">plantations, but there were forty or fifty prosperous cotton farms in the southern part of our state. Klaus</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Detterick owned one of them. By the standards of the nineteen-fifties he would have been considered</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">only a rung above shirttail poor, but by those of the thirties he was considered well-to-do because he</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">actually paid his store bill in cash at the end of most months, and he could meet the bank president's eyes</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">if they happened to pass on the street. The farmhouse was clean and commodious. In addition to the</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">cotton, there were the other two c's: chickens and a few cows. He and his wife had three children:</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="643" height="19" font="3">Howard. who was twelve or thereabouts, and the twin girls. Cora and Kathe.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">On a warm night in June of that year, the girls asked for and were given permission to sleep on the</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">screen-enclosed side porch, which ran the length of the house. This was a great treat for them. Their</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">mother kissed them goodnight just shy of nine, when the last light had gone out of the sky. It was the</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">final time she saw either of them until they were in their coffins and the undertaker had repaired the</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="176" height="19" font="3">worst of the damage.</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Country families went to bed early in those days - &#34;soon as 'twas dark under the table,&#34; my own mother</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">sometimes said - and slept soundly. Certainly Klaus, Marjorie, and Howie Detterick did on the night the</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">twins were taken. Klaus would almost certainly have been wakened by Bowser, the family's big old</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="705" height="19" font="3">half-breed collie, if he had barked, but Bowser didn't. Not that night, not ever again.</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Klaus was up at first light to do the milking. The porch was on the side of the house away from the barn,</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">and Klaus never thought to look in on the girls. Bowser's failure to join him was no cause for alarm,</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">either. The dog held the cows and the chickens alike in great disdain, and usually hid in his doghouse</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">behind the barn when the chores were being performed, unless called ... and called energetically, at that.</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">Marjorie came downstairs fifteen minutes or so after her husband had pulled on his boots in the</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">mudroom and tromped out to the barn. She started the coffee, then put bacon on to fry. The combined</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">smells brought Howie down from his room under the eaves, but not the girls from the porch. She sent</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Howie out to fetch them as she cracked eggs into the bacon grease. Klaus would want the girls out to get</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">fresh ones as soon as breakfast was over. Except no breakfast was eaten in the Detterick house that</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">morning. Howie came back from the porch, white around the gills and with his formerly sleep-puffy eyes</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="134" height="19" font="3">now wide open.</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="201" height="19" font="3">&#34;They're gone,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">Marjorie went out onto the porch, at first more annoyed than alarmed. She said later that she had</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">supposed, if she had supposed anything, that the girls had decided to take a walk and pick flowers by the</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">dawn's early light. That or some similar green-girl foolishness. One look, and she understood why Howie</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="132" height="19" font="3">had been white.</text>
</page>
<page number="14" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">She screamed for <i>Klaus - shrieked for</i> him - and Klaus came on the dead run, his workboots whitened by</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">the half-full pail of milk he had spilled on them. What he found on the porch would have jellied the legs</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">of the most courageous parent. The blankets in which the girls would have bundled themselves as the</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">night drew on and grew colder had been cast into one comer. The screen door had been yanked off its</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">upper hinge and hung drunkenly out into the dooryard. And on the boards of both the porch and the steps</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="529" height="19" font="3">beyond the mutilated screen door, there were spatters of blood.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Marjorie begged her husband not to go hunting after the girls alone, and not to take their son if he felt he</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">had to go after them, but she could have saved her breath. He took the shotgun he kept mounted in the</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">mudroom high out of the reach of little hands, and gave Howie the .22 they had been saving for his</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">birthday in July. Then they went, neither of them paying the slightest attention to the shrieking, weeping</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">woman who wanted to know what they would do if they met a gang of wandering hobos or a bunch of</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">bad niggers escaped from the county farm over in Laduc. In this I think the men were right, you know.</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">The blood was no longer runny, but it was only tacky yet, and still closer to true red than the maroon that</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">comes when blood has well dried. The abduction hadn't happened too long ago. Klaus must have</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="620" height="19" font="3">reasoned that there was still a chance for his girls, and he meant to take it.</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Neither one of them could track worth a damn - they were gatherers, not hunters, men who went into the</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">woods after coon and deer in their seasons not because they much wanted to, but because it was an</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">expected thing. And the dooryard around the house was a blighted patch of dirt with tracks all overlaid in</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">a meaningless tangle. They went around the barn, and saw almost at once why Bowser, a bad biter but a</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">good barker, hadn't sounded the alarm. He lay half in and half out of a doghouse which had been built of</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">leftover barnboards (there was a signboard with the word <i>Bowser</i> neatly printed on it over the curved</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">hole in the front - I saw a photograph of it in one of the papers), his head turned most of the way around</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">on his neck. It would have taken a man of enormous power to have done that to such a big animal, the</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">prosecutor later told John Coffey's jury ... and then he had looked long and meaningfully at the hulking</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">defendant, sitting behind the defense table with his eyes cast down and wearing a brand-new pair of</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">state-bought bib overalls that looked like damnation in and of themselves. Beside the dog, Klaus and</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Howie found a scrap of cooked link sausage. The theory - a sound one, I have no doubt - was that Coffey</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">had first charmed the dog with treats, and then, as Bowser began to eat the last one, had reached out his</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="518" height="19" font="3">hands and broken its neck with one mighty snap of his wrists.</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">Beyond the barn was Detterick's north pasture, where no cows would graze that day. It was drenched</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">with morning dew, and leading off through it, cutting on a diagonal to the northwest and plain as day,</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="337" height="19" font="3">was the beaten track of a man's passage.</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Even in his state of near-hysteria, Klaus Detterick hesitated at first to follow it. It wasn't fear of the man</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">or men who had taken his daughters; it was fear of following the abductor's backtrail ... of going off in</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="586" height="19" font="3">exactly the wrong direction at a time when every second might count.</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Howie solved that dilemma by plucking a shred of yellow cotton cloth from a bush growing just beyond</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">the edge of the dooryard. Klaus was shown this same scrap of cloth as he sat on the witness stand, and</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">began to weep as he identified it as a piece of his daughter Kathe's sleeping-shorts. Twenty yards beyond</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">it, hanging from the jutting finger of a juniper shrub, they found a piece of faded green cloth that</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="726" height="19" font="3">matched the nightie Cora had been wearing when she kissed her ma and pa goodnight.</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">The Dettericks, father and son, set off at a near-run with their guns held in front of them, as soldiers do</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">when crossing contested ground under heavy fire. If I wonder at anything that happened that day. it is</text>

<page number="15" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">that the boy, chasing desperately after his father (and often in danger of being left behind completely),</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="437" height="19" font="3">never fell and put a bullet in Klaus Detterick's back.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">The farmhouse was on the exchange - another sign to the neighbors that the Dettericks were prospering,</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">at least moderately, in disastrous times - and Marjorie used Central to call as many of her neighbors that</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="761" height="19" font="3">were also on the exchange as she could, telling them of the disaster which had fallen like a</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">lightning-stroke out of a clear sky, knowing that each call would produce overlapping ripples, like</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">pebbles tossed rapidly into a stilly pond. Then she lifted the handset one last time, and spoke those words</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">that were almost a trademark of the early telephone systems of that time, at least in the rural South:</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="312" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hello, Central, are you on the line?&#34;</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Central was, but for a moment could say nothing, that worthy woman was all agog. At last she managed,</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Detterick, I sure am, oh dear sweet blessed Jesus, I'm a-prayin right now that your</text>

<text top="368" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, thank you,&#34; Marjorie said. &#34;But you tell the Lord to wait long enough for you to put me through to</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="402" height="19" font="3">the high sheriff's office down Tefton, all right?&#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">The Trapingus County high sheriff was a whiskeynosed old boy with a gut like a washtub and a head of</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">white hair so fine it looked like pipe-cleaner fuzz. I knew him well; he'd been up to Cold Mountain</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">plenty of times to see what he called &#34;his boys&#34; off into the great beyond. Execution witnesses sat in the</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">same folding chairs you've probably sat in yourself a time or two, at funerals or church suppers or</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Grange bingo (in fact, we borrowed ours from the Mystic Tie No. 44 Grange back in those days), and</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">every time Sheriff Homer Cribus sat down in one, I waited for the dry crack that would signal collapse. I</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">dreaded that day and hoped for it, both at the same time, but it was a day that never came. Not long after</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">- couldn't have been more than one summer after the Detterick girls were abducted - he had a heart attack</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">in his office, apparently while screwing a seventeen year-old black girl named Daphne Shurtleff. There</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">was a lot of talk about that, with him always sporting his wife and six boys around so prominent come</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">election time - those were the days when, if you wanted to run for something, the saying used to be &#34;Be</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Baptist or be gone.&#34; But people love a hypocrite, you know - they recognize one of their own, and it</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">always feels so good when someone gets caught with his pants down and his dick up and it isn't you.</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Besides being a hypocrite, he was incompetent, the kind of fellow who'd get himself photographed pet</text>

<text top="806" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Duplissey still made their own mandolins and often spat out their own rotted teeth as they plowed; deep</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">countryside where men were apt to handle snakes on Sunday morning and lie down in carnal embrace</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">with their daughters on Sunday night. I knew their families; most of them had sent Sparky a meal from</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">time to time. On the far side of the river, the members of the posse could see the June sun glinting off the</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">steel rails of a Great Southern branch line. About a mile downstream to their right, a trestle crossed</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="316" height="19" font="3">toward the coal-fields of West Green.</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Here they found a wide trampled patch in the grass and low bushes, a patch so bloody that many of the</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">men had to sprint back into the woods and relieve themselves of their breakfasts. They also found the rest</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">of Cora's nightgown lying in this bloody patch, and Howie, who had held up admirably until then, reeled</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">back against his father and nearly fainted.</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">And it was here that Bobo Marchant's dogs had their first and only disagreement of the day. There were</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">six in all, two bloodhounds, two bluetick hounds, and a couple of those terrierlike mongrels border</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Southerners call coon hounds. The coonies wanted to go northwest, upstream along the Trapingus; the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">rest wanted to go in the other direction, southeast. They got all tangled in their leads, and although the</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">papers said nothing about this part, I could imagine the horrible curses Bobo must have rained down on</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">them as he used his hands - surely the most educated part of him - to get them straightened around again.</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">I have known a few hound-dog men in my time, and it's been my experience that, as a class, they run</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="202" height="19" font="3">remarkably true to type.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">Bobo shortleashed them into a pack, then ran Cora Detterick's torn nightgown under their noses, to kind</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">of remind them what they were doing out on a day when the temperature would be in the mid-nineties by</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">noon and the noseeums were already circling the heads of the possemen in clouds. The coonies took</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="787" height="19" font="3">another sniff, decided to vote the straight ticket, and off they all went downstream, in full cry.</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">It wasn't but ten minutes later when the men stopped, realizing they could hear more than just the dogs. It</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">was a howling rather than a baying, and a sound no dog had ever made, not even in its dying extremities.</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">It was a sound none of them had ever heard anything make, but they knew right away, all of them, that it</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">was a man. So they said, and I believed them. I think I would have recognized it, too. I have heard men</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">scream just that way, I think, on their way to the electric chair. Not a lot - most button themselves up and</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">go either quiet or joking, like it was the class picnic - but a few. Usually the ones who believe in hell as a</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="602" height="19" font="3">real place, and know it is waiting for them at the end of the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">Bobo shortleashed his dogs again. They were valuable, and he had no intention of losing them to the</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">psychopath howling and gibbering just down yonder. The other men reloaded their guns and snapped</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">them closed. That howling had chilled them all, and made the sweat under their arms and running down</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">their backs feel like icewater. When men take a chill like that, they need a leader if they are to go on, and</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Deputy McGee led them. He got out in front and walked briskly (I bet he didn't <i>feel</i> very brisk right then,</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">though) to a stand of alders that jutted out of the woods on the right, with the rest of them trundling along</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">nervously about five paces behind. He paused just once, and that was to motion the biggest man among</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="416" height="19" font="3">them - Sam Hollis - to keep near Klaus Detterick.</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">On the other side of the alders there was more open ground stretching back to the woods on the right. On</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">the left was the long, gentle slope of the riverbank. They all stopped where they were, thunderstruck. I</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">think they would have given a good deal to unsee what was before them, and none of them would ever</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">forget it - it was the sort of nightmare, bald and almost smoking in the sun, that lies beyond the drapes</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">and furnishings of good and ordinary lives - church suppers, walks along country lanes, honest work,</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">love-kisses in bed. There is a skull in every man, and I tell you there is a skull in the lives of all men.</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="696" height="19" font="3">They saw it that day, those men - they saw what sometimes grins behind the smile.</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Sitting on the riverbank in a faded, bloodstained jumper was the biggest man any of them had ever seen -</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">John Coffey. His enormous, splay-toed feet were bare. On his head he wore a faded red bandanna, the</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">way a country woman would wear a kerchief into church. Gnats circled him in a black cloud. Curled in</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">each arm was the body of a naked girl. Their blonde hair, once curly and light as milkweed fluff, was</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">now matted to their heads and streaked red. The man holding them sat bawling up at the sky like a</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">moonstruck calf, his dark brown cheeks slicked with tears, his face twisted in a monstrous cramp of grief</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">He drew breath in hitches, his chest rising until the snaps holding the straps of his jumper were strained,</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">and then let that vast catch of air out in another of those howls. So often you read in the paper that &#34;the</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">killer showed no remorse,&#34; but that wasn't the case here. John Coffey was torn open by what he had done</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">... but he would live. The girls would not. They had been torn open in a more fundamental way.</text>

<page number="17" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">No one seemed to know how long they stood there, looking at the howling man who was, in his turn,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">looking across the great still plate of the river at a train on the other side, storming down the tracks</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">toward the trestle that crossed the river. It seemed they looked for an hour or for forever, and yet the train</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">got no farther along, it seemed to storm only in one place, like a child doing a tantrum, and the sun did</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">not go behind a cloud, and the sight was not blotted from their eyes. It was there before them, as real as a</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">dogbite. The black man rocked back and forth; Cora and Kathe rocked with him like dolls in the arms of</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">a giant. The bloodstained muscles in the man's huge, bare arms flexed and relaxed, flexed and relaxed,</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">flexed and relaxed.</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">It was Klaus Detterick who broke the tableau. Screaming, he flung himself at the monster who had raped</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">and killed his daughters. Sam Hollis knew his job and tried to do it, but couldn't. He was six inches taller</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">than Klaus and outweighed him by at least seventy pounds, but Klaus seemed to almost shrug his</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">encircling arms off. Klaus flew across the intervening open ground and launched a flying kick at Coffey's</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">head. His workboot, caked with spilled milk that had already soured in the heat, scored a direct hit on</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Coffey's left temple, but Coffey seemed not to feel it at all. He only sat there, keening and rocking and</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">looking out across the river; the way I imagine it, he could almost have been a picture out of some piney</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">woods Pentecostal sermon, the faithful follower of the Cross looking out toward Goshen Land ... if not</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="209" height="19" font="3">for the corpses, that was.</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">It took four men to haul the hysterical farmer off John Coffey, and he fetched Coffey I don't know how</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">many good licks before they finally did. It didn't seem to matter to Coffey, one way or the other; he just</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">went on looking out across the river and keening. As for Detterick, all the fight went out of him when he</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">was finally pulled off - as if some strange galvanizing current had been running through the huge black</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">man (I still have a tendency to think in electrical metaphors; you'll have to pardon me), and when</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Detterick's contact with that power source was finally broken, he went as limp as a man flung back from</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">a live wire. He knelt wide-legged on the riverbank with his hands to his face, sobbing. Howie joined him</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">and they hugged each other forehead to forehead.</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Two men watched them while the rest formed a rifle-toting ring around the rocking, wailing black man.</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">He still seemed not to realize that anyone but him was there. McGee stepped forward, shifted uncertainly</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="348" height="19" font="3">from foot to foot for a bit, then hunkered.</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mister,&#34; he said in a quiet voice, and Coffey hushed at once. McGee looked at eyes that were bloodshot</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">from crying. And still they streamed, as if someone had left a faucet on inside him. Those eyes wept, and</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">yet were somehow untouched ... distant and serene. I thought them the strangest eyes I had ever seen in</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">my life, and McGee felt much the same. &#34;Like the eyes of an animal that never saw a man before,&#34; he</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">told a reporter named Hammersmith just before the trial.</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="347" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mister, do you hear me?&#34; McGee asked.</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">Slowly, Coffey nodded his head. Still he curled his arms around his unspeakable dolls, their chins down</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">on their chests so their faces could not be clearly seen, one of the few mercies God saw fit to bestow that</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="36" height="19" font="3">day.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="324" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do you have a name?&#34; MeGee asked.</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey,&#34; he said in a thick and tear-clotted voice. &#34;Coffey like the drink, only not spelled the same</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="49" height="19" font="3">way.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="18" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">McGee nodded, then pointed a thumb at the chest pocket of Coffey's jumper, which was bulging. It</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">looked to McGee like it might have been a gun - not that a man Coffey's size would need a gun to do</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">some major damage, if he decided to go off. &#34;What's that in there, John Coffey? Is that maybe a heater?</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="85" height="19" font="3">A pistol?&#34;</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nosir,&#34; Coffey said in his thick voice, and those strange eyes - welling tears and agonized on top, distant</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">and weirdly serene underneath, as if the true John Coffey was somewhere else, looking out on some</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">other landscape where murdered little girls were nothing to get all worked up about -never left Deputy</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="360" height="19" font="3">McGee's. &#34;That's just a little lunch I have.&#34;</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, now, a little lunch, is that right?&#34; McGee asked, and Coffey nodded and said yessir with his eyes</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">running and dear snot-runners hanging out of his nose. &#34;And where did the likes of you get a little lunch,</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">John Coffey?&#34; Forcing himself to be calm, although he could smell the girls by then, and could see the</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">flies lighting and sampling the places on them that were wet. It was their hair that was the worst, he said</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">later ... and this wasn't in any newspaper story; it was considered too grisly for family reading. No, this I</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">got from the reporter who wrote the story, Mr. Hammersmith. I looked him up later on, because later on</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">John Coffey became sort of an obsession with me. McGee told this Hammersmith that their blonde hair</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">wasn't blonde anymore. It was auburn. Blood had run down their cheeks out of it like it was a bad</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">dye-job, and you didn't have to be a doctor to see that their fragile skulls had been dashed together with</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">the force of those mighty arms. Probably they had been crying. Probably he had wanted to make them</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="572" height="19" font="3">stop. If the girls had been lucky, this had happened before the rapes.</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">Looking at that made it hard for a man to think, even a man as determined to do his job as Deputy</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">McGee was. Bad thinking could cause mistakes, maybe more bloodshed. McGee drew him in a deep</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="359" height="19" font="3">breath and calmed himself. Tried, anyway.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">'Wellsir, I don't exactly remember, be dog if I do,&#34; Coffey said in his tear-choked voice, &#34;but it's a little</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="460" height="19" font="3">lunch, all right, sammidges and I think a swee' pickle.&#34;</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">I might just have a look for myself, it's all the same to you,&#34; McGee said. &#34;Don't you move now, John</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">Coffey. Don't do it, boy, because there are enough guns aimed at you to make you disappear from the</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="409" height="19" font="3">waist up should you so much as twitch a finger.&#34;</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Coffey looked out across the river and didn't move as McGee gently reached into the chest pocket of</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">those biballs and pulled out something wrapped in newspaper and tied with a hank of butcher's twine.</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">MeGee snapped the string and opened the paper, although he was pretty sure it was just what Coffey said</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">it was, a little lunch. There was a bacon-tomato sandwich and a jelly fold-over. There was also a pickle,</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">wrapped in its own piece of a funny page John Coffey would never be able to puzzle out. There were no</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="627" height="19" font="3">sausages. Bowser had gotten the sausages out of John Coffey's little lunch.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">McGee handed the lunch back over his shoulder to one of the other men without taking his eyes off</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Coffey. Hunkered down like that, he was too close to want to let his attention stray for even a second.</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">The lunch, wrapped up again and tied for good measure, finally ended up with Bobo Marchant, who put</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">it in his knapsack, where he kept treats for his dogs (and a few fishing lures, I shouldn't wonder). It</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">wasn't introduced into evidence at the trial - justice in this part of the world is swift, but not as swift as a</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="562" height="19" font="3">bacon-tomato sandwich goes over - though photographs of it were.</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">'What happened here, John Coffey?&#34; McGee asked in his low, earnest voice. &#34;You want to tell me that?&#34;</text>

<page number="19" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">And Coffey said to McGee and the others almost exactly the same thing he said to me; they were also the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">last words the prosecutor said to the jury at Coffey's trial. &#34;I couldn't help it,&#34; John Coffey said, holding</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the murdered, violated girls naked in his arms. The tears began to pour down his cheeks again. &#34;I tried to</text>

<text top="185" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">The jury was out forty-five minutes. Just about time enough to eat a little lunch of their own. I wonder</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="234" height="19" font="3">they had any stomach for it.</text>

<text top="287" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">I think you know I didn't find all that out during one hot October afternoon in the soon-to-be-defunct</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">prison library, from one set of old newspapers stacked in a pair of Pomona orange crates, but I learned</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">enough to make it hard for me to sleep that night. When my wife got up at two in the morning and found</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">me sitting in the kitchen, drinking buttermilk and smoking home-rolled Bugler, she asked me what was</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">wrong and I lied to her for one of the few times in the long course of our marriage. I said I'd had another</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">run-in with Percy Wetmore. I had, of course, but that wasn't the reason she'd found me sitting up late. I</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="374" height="19" font="3">was usually able to leave Percy at the office.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">'Well, forget that rotten apple and come on back to bed,&#34; she said. &#34;I've got something that'll help you</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="323" height="19" font="3">sleep, and you can have all you want.&#34;</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">&#34;That sounds good, but I think we'd better not,&#34; I said. &#34;I've got a little something wrong with my</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="441" height="19" font="3">waterworks, and wouldn't want to pass it on to you.&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">She raised an eyebrow. &#34;Waterworks, huh,&#34; she said. &#34;I guess you must have taken up with the wrong</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">streetcorner girl the last time you were in Baton Rouge.&#34; I've never been in Baton Rouge and never so</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="481" height="19" font="3">much as touched a streetcorner girl, and we both knew it.</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's just a plain old urinary infection,&#34; I said. &#34;My mother used to say boys got them from taking a leak</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="299" height="19" font="3">when the north wind was blowing.&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="765" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your mother also used to stay in all day if she spilled the salt,&#34; my wife said. &#34;Dr Sadler-&#34;</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, sir,&#34; I said, raising my hand. &#34;He'll want me to take sulfa, and I'll be throwing up in every comer of</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">my office by the end of the week. It'll run its course, but in the meantime, I guess we best stay out of the</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="109" height="19" font="3">playground.&#34;</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">She kissed my forehead right over my left eyebrow, which always gives me the prickles ... as Janice well</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="727" height="19" font="3">knew. &#34;Poor baby. As if that awful Percy Wetmore wasn't enough. Come to bed soon!'</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I did, but before I did, I stepped out onto the back porch to empty out (and checked the wind direction</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">with a wet thumb before I did - what our parents tell us when we are small seldom goes ignored, no</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">matter how foolish it may be). Peeing outdoors is one joy of country living the poets never quite got</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">around to, but it was no joy that night; the water coming out of me burned like a line of lit coal-oil. Yet I</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">thought it had been a little worse that afternoon, and <i>knew</i> it had been worse the two or three days before.</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">I had hopes that maybe I had started to mend. Never was a hope more ill-founded. No one had told me</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">that sometimes a bug that gets up inside there, where it's warm and wet, can take a day or two off to rest</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">before coming on strong again. I would have been surprised to know it. I would have been even more</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">surprised to know that, in another fifteen or twenty years, there would be pills you could take that would</text>

<text top="131" left="15" width="761" height="19" font="3">feeling that someone had spilled coal-oil inside your works and then touched a match to it.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">I finished my butt, went into the bedroom, and finally got to sleep. I dreamed of girls with shy smiles and</text>

<text top="272" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">The next morning there was a pink memo slip on my desk, asking me to stop by the warden's office as</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">soon as I could. I knew what that was about - there were unwritten but very important rules to the game,</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">and I had stopped playing by them for awhile yesterday - and so I put it off as long as possible. Like</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">going to the doctor about my waterworks problem, I suppose. I've always thought this &#34;get-it-over-with&#34;</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="199" height="19" font="3">business was overrated.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Anyway, I didn't hurry to Warden Moores's office. I stripped off my wool uniform coat instead, hung it</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">over the back of my chair, and turned on the fan in the corner - it was another hot one. Then I sat down</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">and went over Brutus Howell's night-sheet. There was nothing there to get alarmed about. Delacroix had</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">wept briefly after turning in - he did most nights, and more for himself than for the folks he had roasted</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">alive, I am quite sure - and then had take Mr. Jingles, the mouse, out of the cigar box he slept in. That</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">had calmed Del, and he had slept like a baby the rest of the night. Mr. Jingles had most likely spent it on</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's stomach, with his tail curled over his paws, eyes unblinking. It was as if God had decided</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Delacroix needed a guardian angel, but had decreed in His wisdom that only a mouse would do for a rat</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">like our homicidal friend from Louisiana. Not all that was in Brutal's report, of course, but I had done</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">enough night watches myself to fill in the stuff between the lines. There was a brief note about Coffey:</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Laid awake, mostly quiet, may have cried some. I tried to get some talk started, but after a few grunted</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="561" height="19" font="3">replies from Coffey, gave up. Paul or Harry may have better luck.&#34;</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Getting the talk started&#34; was at the center of our job, really. I didn't know it then, but looking back from</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">the vantage point of this strange old age (I think all old ages seem strange to the folk who must endure</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">them), I understand that it was, and why I didn't see it then - it was too big, as central to our work as our</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">respiration was to our lives. It wasn't important that the floaters be good at &#34;getting the talk started,&#34; but</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">it was vital for me and Harry and Brutal and Dean... and it was one reason why Percy Wetmore was such</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">a disaster. The inmates hated him, the guards hated him ... everyone hated him, presumably, except for</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">his political connections, Percy himself, and maybe (but only maybe) his mother. He was like a dose of</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">white arsenic sprinkled into a wedding cake, and I think I knew he spelled disaster the start. He was an</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">accident waiting to happen. As for the rest of us, we would have scoffed at the idea that we functioned</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">most usefully not as the guards of the condemned but as their psychiatrists part of me still wants to scoff</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">at that idea today - but we knew about getting the talk started . . . and without the talk, men facing Old</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="346" height="19" font="3">Sparky had a nasty habit of going insane.</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I made a note at the bottom of Brutal's report to talk to John Coffey - to try, at least - and then passed on</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">to a note from Curtis Anderson, the warden's chief assistant. It said that he, Anderson, expected a DOE</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">order for Edward Delacrois (Anderson's misspelling; the man's name was actually Eduard Delacroix)</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">very soon. DOE stood for date of execution, and according to the note, Curtis had been told on good</text>

<page number="21" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">best guess, and Curtis Anderson's guesses were very informed. But before then we could expect a new</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">resident, name of William Wharton. &#34;He's what you like to call 'a problem child,' &#34; Curtis had written ' in</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">his backslanting and somehow prissy script. &#34;Crazy-wild and proud of it. Has rambled all over the state</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">for the last year or so, and has hit the big time at last. Killed three people in a holdup, one a pregnant</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">woman, killed a fourth in the getaway. State Patrolman. All he missed was a nun and a blind man!' I</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">smiled a little at that. &#34;Wharton is 19 years old, has <i>Billy the Kid</i> tattooed on upper l. forearm. You will</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">have to slap his nose a time or two, I guarantee you that, but be careful when you do it. This man just</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="771" height="19" font="3">doesn't care.&#34; He had underlined this last sentiment twice, then finished: &#34;Also, he may be a</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="645" height="19" font="3">hang-arounder. He's working appeals, and there's the fact that he is a minor.&#34;</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">A crazy kid, working appeals, apt to be around for awhile. Oh, that all sounded just fine. Suddenly the</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="693" height="19" font="3">day seemed hotter than ever, and I could no longer put off seeing Warden Moores.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">I worked for three wardens during my years as a Cold Mountain guard; Hal Moores was the last and best</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">of them. In a walk. Honest, straightforward, lacking even Curtis Anderson's rudimentary wit, but</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">equipped with just enough political savvy to keep his job during those grim years ... and enough integrity</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">to keep from getting seduced by the game. He would not rise any higher, but that seemed all right with</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">him. He was fifty-eight or -nine back then, with a deeply lined bloodhound face that Bobo Marchant</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">probably would have felt right at home with. He had white hair and his hands shook with some sort of</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">palsy, but he was strong. The year before, when a prisoner had rushed him in the exercise yard with a</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">shank whittled out of a crate-slat, Moores had stood his ground, grabbed the skatehound's wrist, and had</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="795" height="19" font="3">twisted it so hard that the snapping bones had sounded like dry twigs burning in a hot fire. The</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">skatehound, all his grievances forgotten, had gone down on his knees in the dirt and begun screaming for</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">his mother. &#34;I'm not her,&#34; Moores said in his cultured Southern voice, &#34;But if I was, I'd raise up my skirts</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="431" height="19" font="3">and piss on you from the loins that gave you birth.&#34;</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">When I came into his office, he started to get up and I waved him back down. I took the seat across the</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">desk from him, and began by asking about his wife ... except in our part of the world, that's not how you</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">do it. &#34;How's that pretty gal of yours&#34; is what I asked, as if Melinda had seen only seventeen summers</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">instead of sixty-two or -three. My concern was genuine he was a woman I could have loved and married</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">myself, if the lines of our lives had coincided - but I didn't mind diverting him a little from his main</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="135" height="19" font="3">business, either.</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="477" height="19" font="3">He sighed deeply. &#34;Not so well, Paul. Not so well at all.&#34;</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="163" height="19" font="3">&#34;More headaches?&#34;</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">&#34;Only one this week, but it was the worst yet - put her flat on her back for most of the day before</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">yesterday. And now she's developed this weakness in her right hand-&#34; He raised his own liverspotted</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">right hand. We both watched it tremble above his blotter for a moment or two, and then he lowered it</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">again. I could tell he would have given just about anything not to be telling me what he was telling me,</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">and I would have given just about anything not to be hearing it. Melinda's headaches had started in the</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">spring, and all that summer her doctor had been saying they were &#34;nervous-tension migraines,&#34; perhaps</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">caused by the stress of Hal's coming retirement. Except that neither of them could wait for his retirement,</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">and my own wife had told me that migraine is not a disease of the old but the young; by the time its</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">sufferers reached Melinda Moores's age, they were usually getting better, not worse. And now this</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">weakness of the hand. It didn't sound like nervous tension to me; it sounded like a damned stroke.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dr. Haverstrom wants her to go in hospital up to Indianola,&#34; Moores said. &#34;Have some tests. Head</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">X-rays, he means. Who knows what else. She is scared to death!' He paused, then added, &#34;Truth to tell,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">so am I.&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, but you see she does it,&#34; I said. &#34;Don't wait. If it turns out to be something they can see with an</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="441" height="19" font="3">X-ray, it may turn out to be something they can fix.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; he agreed, and then, for just a moment - the only one during that part of our interview, as I recall -</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">our eyes met and locked. There was the sort of nakedly perfect understanding between us that needs no</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">words. It could be a stroke, yes. It could also be a cancer growing in her brain, and if it was that, the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">chances that the doctors at Indianola could do anything about it were slim going on none. This was '32,</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">remember, when even something as relatively simple as a urinary infection was either sulfa and stink or</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="131" height="19" font="3">suffer and wait.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="623" height="19" font="3">&#34;I thank you for your concern, Paul. Now let's talk about Percy Wetmore!'</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="267" height="19" font="3">I groaned and covered my eyes.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;I had a call from the state capital this morning,&#34; the warden said evenly. &#34;It was quite an angry call, as</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">I'm sure you can imagine. Paul, the governor is so married he's almost not there, if you take my meaning.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">And his wife has a brother who has one child. That child is Percy Wetmore. Percy called his dad last</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="749" height="19" font="3">night, and Percy's dad called Percy's aunt. Do I have to trace the rest of this out for you?&#34;</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="798" height="19" font="3">'No,&#34; I said. &#34;Percy squealed. Just like the schoolroom sissy telling teacher he saw Jack and Jill</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="254" height="19" font="3">smooching in the cloakroom.&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="425" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep,&#34; Moores agreed, &#34;that's about the size of it.&#34;</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;You know what happened between Percy and Delacroix when Delacroix came in?&#34; I asked. &#34;Percy and</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="270" height="19" font="3">his damned hickory billy-club?&#34;</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="105" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, but - &#34;</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;And you know how he runs it along the bars sometimes, just for the pure hell of it. He's mean, and he's</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="630" height="19" font="3">stupid, and I don't know how much longer I can take him. That's the truth.&#34;</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">We'd known each other five years. That can be a long time for men who get on well, especially when part</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">of the job is trading life for death. What I'm saying is that he understood what I meant. Not that I would</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">quit; not with the Depression walking around outside the prison walls like a dangerous criminal, one that</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">couldn't be caged as our charges were. Better men than me were out on the roads or riding the rods. I was</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">lucky and knew it - children grown and the mortgage, that two-hundred-pound block of marble, had been</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">off my chest for the last two years. But a man's got to eat, and his wife has to eat, too. Also, we were</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">used to sending our daughter and son-in-law twenty bucks whenever we could afford it (and sometimes</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">when we couldn't, if Jane's letters sounded particularly desperate). He was an out-of-work high-school</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">teacher, and if that didn't qualify for desperate back in those days, then the word had no meaning. So no,</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">you didn't walk off a steady paycheck job like mine ... not in cold blood, that was. But my blood wasn't</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">cold that fall. The temperatures outside were unseasonable, and the infection crawling around inside me</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">had turned the thermostat up even more. And when a man's in that kind of situation, why, sometimes his</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">fist flies out pretty much of its own accord. And if you slug a connected man like Percy Wetmore once,</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">you might as well just go right on slugging, because there's no going back.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Stick with it,&#34; Moores said quietly. &#34;That's what I called you in here to say. I have it on good authority -</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">the person who called me this morning, in fact - that Percy has an application in at Briar, and that his</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="249" height="19" font="3">application will be accepted.&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;Briar,&#34; I said. That was Briar Ridge, one of two state-run hospitals. 'What's this kid doing? Touring state</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="90" height="19" font="3">facilities?&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's an administration job. Better pay, and papers to push instead of hospital beds in the heat of the day.&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">He gave me a slanted grin. &#34;You know, Paul, you might be shed of him already if you hadn't put him in</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">the switch-room with Van Hay when The Chief walked.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">For a moment what he said seemed so peculiar I didn't have a clue what he was getting at. Maybe I didn't</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="167" height="19" font="4"><i>want</i> to have a clue.</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where else would I put him?&#34; I asked. &#34;Christ, he hardly knows what he's doing on the block! To make</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">him part of the active execution team - &#34; I didn't finish. Couldn't finish. The potential for screw-ups</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="135" height="19" font="3">seemed endless.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nevertheless, you'd do well to put him out for Delacroix. If you want to get rid of him, that is.&#34;</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I looked at him with my jaw hung. At last I was able to get it up where it belonged so I could talk. &#34;What</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">are you saying? That he wants to experience one right up close where he can smell the guy's nuts</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="86" height="19" font="3">cooking?&#34;</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">Moores shrugged. His eyes, so soft when he had been speaking about his wife, now looked flinty.</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">&#34;Delacroix's nuts are going to cook whether Wetmore's on the team or not,&#34; he said. &#34;Correct?&#34;</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, but he could screw up. In fact, Hal, he's almost <i>bound</i> to screw up. And in front of thirty or so</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">witnesses ... reporters all the way up from Louisiana . . .&#34;</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;You and Brutus Howell will make sure he doesn't,&#34; Moores said. &#34;And if he does anyway, it goes on his</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="789" height="19" font="3">record, and it'll still be there long after his statehouse connections are gone. You understand?&#34;</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="3">I did. It made me feel sick and scared, but I did.</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;He may want to stay for Coffey, but if we're lucky, he'll get all he needs from Delacroix. You just make</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="290" height="19" font="3">sure you put him out for that one.&#34;</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">I had planned to stick Percy in the switch-room again, then down in the tunnel, riding shotgun on the</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">gurney that would take Delacroix to the meatwagon parked across the road from the prison, but I tossed</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">all those plans back over my shoulder without so much as a second look. I nodded. I had the sense to</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">know it was a gamble I was taking, but I didn't care. If it would get rid of Percy Wetmore, I'd tweak the</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">devil's nose. He could take part in his execution, clamp on the cap, and then look through the grille and</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="809" height="19" font="3">tell Van Hay to roll on two; he could watch the little Frenchman ride the lightning that he, Percy</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">Wetmore, had let out of the bottle. Let him have his nasty little thrill, if that's what state-sanctioned</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">murder was to him. Let him go on to Briar Ridge, where he would have his own office and a fan to cool</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">it. And if his uncle by marriage was voted out of office in the next election and he had to find out what</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">work was like in the tough old sunbaked world where not all the bad guys were locked behind bars and</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; I said, standing up. &#34;I'll put him out front for Delacroix. And in the meantime, I'll keep the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="62" height="19" font="3">peace.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;Good,&#34; he said, and stood up himself. &#34;By the way, how's that problem of yours?&#34; He pointed delicately</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="237" height="19" font="3">in the direction of my groin.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="189" height="19" font="3">&#34;Seems a little better.&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">'Well, that's fine.&#34; He saw me to the door. &#34;What about Coffey, by the way? Is he going to be a</text>

<text top="263" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't think so,&#34; I said. &#34;So far he's been as quiet as a dead rooster. He's strange - strange eyes - but</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="530" height="19" font="3">quiet. We'll keep tabs on him, though. Don't worry about that!&#34;</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="302" height="19" font="3">&#34;You know what he did, of course.&#34;</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure.&#34;</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">He was seeing me through to the outer office by then, where old Miss Hannah sat bashing away at her</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Underwood as she had ever since the last ice age had ended, it seemed. I was happy to go. All in all, I felt</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">as if I'd gotten off easy. And it was nice to know there was a chance of surviving Percy, after all.</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">&#34;You send Melinda a whole basket of my love,&#34; I said. &#34;And don't go buying you an extra crate of</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="625" height="19" font="3">trouble, either. It'll probably turn out to be nothing but migraine, after all.&#34;</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;You bet,&#34; he said, and below his sick eyes, his lips smiled. The combination was damned near ghoulish.</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">As for me, I went back to E Block to start another day. There was paperwork to be read and written, there</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">were floors to be mopped, there were meals to be served, a duty roster to be made out for the following</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">week, there were a hundred details to be seen to. But mostly there was waiting - in prison there's always</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">plenty of that, so much it never gets done. Waiting for Eduard Delacroix to walk the Green Mile, waiting</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">for William Wharton to arrive with his curled lip and Billy the Kid tattoo, and, most of all, waiting for</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="349" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore to be gone out of my life.</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>7.</b></text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's mouse was one of God's mysteries. I never saw one in E Block before that summer, and</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">never saw one after that fall, when Delacroix passed from our company on a hot and thundery night in</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">October - passed from it in a manner so unspeakable I can barely bring myself to recall it. Delacroix</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">claimed that he trained that mouse, which started its life among us as Steamboat Willy, but I really think</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">it was the other way around. Dean Stanton felt the same way, and so did Brutal. Both of them were there</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">the night the mouse put in its first appearance, and as Brutal said, &#34;The thing 'us half-tame already, and</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">twice as smart as that Cajun what thought he owned it.&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">Dean and I were in my office, going over the record-box for the last year, getting ready to write</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">follow-up letters to witnesses of five executions, and to write follow-ups to follow-ups in another six</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">stretching all the way back to '29. Basically, we wanted to know just one thing: were they pleased with</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">the service? I know it sounds grotesque, but it was an important consideration. As taxpayers they were</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">our customers, but very special ones. A man or a woman who will turn out at midnight to watch a man</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">die has got a special, pressing reason to be there, a special need, and if execution is a proper punishment,</text>
</page>
<page number="25" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">then that need ought to be satisfied. They've had a nightmare. The purpose of the execution is to show</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="635" height="19" font="3">them that the nightmare is over. Maybe it even works that way. Sometimes.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey!&#34; Brutal called from outside the door, where he was manning the desk at the head of the hall. &#34;Hey,</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="200" height="19" font="3">you two! Get out here!&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="804" height="19" font="3">Dean and I gazed at each other with identical expressions of alarm, thinking that something had</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">happened to either the Indian from Oklahoma (his name was Arlen Bitterbuck, but we called him The</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">Chief ... or, in Harry Terwilliger's case, Chief Coat Cheese, because that was what Harry claimed</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">Bitterbuck smelled like), or the fellow we called The President. But then Brutal started to laugh, and we</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">hurried to see what was happening. Laughing in E Block sounded almost as wrong as laughing in church.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">Old Toot-Toot, the trusty who ran the food-wagon in those days, had been by with his holy-rolling</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">cartful of goodies, and Brutal had stocked up for a long night - three sandwiches, two pops, and a couple</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">of moon pies. Also a side of potato salad Toot had undoubtedly filched from the prison kitchen, which</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">was supposed to be off-limits to him. Brutal had the logbook open in front of him, and for a wonder he</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="591" height="19" font="3">hadn't spilled anything on it yet. Of course, he was just getting started.</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="288" height="19" font="3">'What?&#34; Dean asked. &#34;What is it?&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;State legislature must have opened the pursestrings enough to hire another screw this year after all,&#34;</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="368" height="19" font="3">Brutal said, still laughing. &#34;Lookie yonder.&#34;</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">He pointed and we saw the mouse. I started to laugh, too, and Dean joined in. You really couldn't help it,</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">because a guard doing quarter-hour check rounds was just like that mouse looked like: a tiny, furry guard</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">making sure no one was trying to escape or commit suicide. It would trot a little way toward us along the</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Green Mile, then turn its head from side to side, as if checking the cells. Then it would make another</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">forward spurt. The fact that we could hear both of our current inmates snoring away in spite of the</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">yelling and the laughter somehow made it even funnier.</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">It was a perfectly ordinary brown mouse, except for the way it seemed to be checking into the cells. It</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">even went into one or two of them, skipping nimbly in between the lower bars in a way I imagine many</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">of our inmates, past and present, would envy. Except it was out that the cons would always be wanting to</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="128" height="19" font="3">skip, of course.</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">The mouse didn't go into either of the occupied cells; only the empties. And finally it had worked its way</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">almost up to where we were. I kept expecting it to turn back, but it didn't. It showed no fear of us at all.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;It ain't normal for a mouse to come up on people that way,&#34; Dean said, a little nervously. &#34;Maybe it's</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="57" height="19" font="3">rabid.&#34;</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, my Christ,&#34; Brutal said through a mouthful of corned-beef sandwich. &#34;The big mouse expert. The</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="501" height="19" font="3">Mouse Man. You see it foamin at the mouth, Mouse Man?&#34;</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;I can't see its mouth at all,&#34; Dean said, and that made us all laugh again. I couldn't see its mouth, either,</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">but I could see the dark little drops that were its eyes, and they didn't look crazy or rabid to me. They</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">looked interested and intelligent. I've put men to death - men with supposedly immortal souls - that</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="270" height="19" font="3">looked dumber than that mouse.</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">It scurried up the Green Mile to a spot that was less than three feet from the duty desk ... which wasn't</text>

<page number="26" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">something fancy, like you might be imagining, but only the sort of desk the teachers used to sit behind up</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">at the district high school. And there it did stop, curling its tail around its paws as prim as an old lady</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="150" height="19" font="3">settling her skirts.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">I stopped laughing all at once, suddenly feeling cold through my flesh all the way to the bones. I want to</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">say I don't know why I felt that way - no one likes to come out with something that's going to make them</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">look or sound ridiculous - but of course I do, and if I can tell the truth about the rest, I guess I can tell the</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">truth about this. For a moment I imagined myself to be that mouse, not a guard at all but just another</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">convicted criminal there on the Green Mile, convicted and condemned but still managing to look bravely</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">up at a desk that must have seemed miles high to it (as the judgment seat of God will no doubt someday</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">seem to us), and at the heavy-voiced, blue-coated giants who sat behind it. Giants that shot its kind with</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">BB guns, or swatted them with brooms, or set traps on them, traps that broke their backs while they crept</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="698" height="19" font="3">cautiously over the word VICTOR to nibble at the cheese on the little copper plate.</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">There was no broom by the duty desk, but there was a rolling mop-bucket with the mop still in the</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">wringer; I'd taken my turn at swabbing the green lino and all six of the cells shortly before sitting down</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">to the record-box with Dean. I saw that Dean meant to grab the mop- and take a swing with it. I touched</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="708" height="19" font="3">his wrist just as his fingers touched the slender wooden handle. &#34;Leave it be,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">He shrugged and drew his hand back. I had a feeling he didn't want to swat it any more than I did.</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">Brutal tore a corner off his corned-beef sandwich and held it out over the front of the desk, tweezed</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">delicately between two fingers. The mouse seemed to look up with an even livelier interest, as if it knew</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="722" height="19" font="3">exactly what it was. Probably did; I could see its whiskers twitch as its nose wriggled.</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;Aw, Brutal, no!&#34; Dean exclaimed, then looked at me. &#34;Don't let him do that, Paul! If he's gonna feed the</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="696" height="19" font="3">damn thing, we might as well put out the welcome mat for anything on four legs.-&#34;</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;I just want to see what he'll do,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;In the interests of science, like.&#34; He looked at me - I was</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">the boss, even in such minor detours from routine as this. I thought about it and shrugged like it didn't</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="760" height="19" font="3">matter much, one way or another. The truth was, I kind of wanted to see what he'd do, too.</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Well, he ate it - of course. There was a Depression on, after all. But the way he ate it fascinated us all. He</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">approached the fragment of sandwich, sniffed his way around it, and then he sat up in front of it like a</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">dog doing a trick, grabbed it, and pulled the bread apart to get at the meat. He did it as deliberately and</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">knowingly as a man tucking into a good roast-beef dinner in his favorite restaurant. I never saw an</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">animal eat like that, not even a well-trained house dog. And all the while he was eating, his eyes never</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="57" height="19" font="3">left us.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;Either one smart mouse or hungry as hell,&#34; a new voice said. It was Bitterbuck. He had awakened and</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">now stood at the bars of his cell, naked except for a pair of saggy-seated boxer shorts. A home-rolled</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">cigarette poked out from between the second and third knuckles of his right hand, and his iron-gray hair</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">lay over his shoulders - once probably muscular but now beginning to soften - in a pair of braids.</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">&#34;You got any Injun wisdom about micies, Chief?&#34; Brutal asked, watching the mouse eat. We were all</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">pretty fetched by the neat way it held the bit of corned beef in its forepaws, occasionally turning it or</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="423" height="19" font="3">glancing at it, as if in admiration and appreciation.</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Naw,&#34; Bitterbuck said. &#34;Knowed a brave once had a pair of what he claimed were mouse-skin gloves,</text>

<page number="27" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">but I didn't believe it!&#34; Then he laughed, as if the whole thing was a joke, and left the bars. We heard the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="279" height="19" font="3">bunk creak as he lay down again.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">That seemed to be the mouse's signal to go. It finished up what it was holding, sniffed at what was left</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">(mostly bread with yellow mustard soaking into it), and then looked back at us, as if it wanted to</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">remember our faces if we met again. Then it turned and scurried off the way it had come, not pausing to</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">do any cell-checks this time. Its hurry made me think of the White Rabbit in <i>Alice's Adventures in</i></text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="4"><i>Wonderland,</i> and I smiled. It didn't pause at the door to the restraint room, but disappeared beneath it.</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">The restraint room had soft walls, for people whose brains had softened a little. We kept cleaning</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">equipment stored in there when we didn't need the room for its created purpose, and a few books (most</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">were westerns by Clarence Mulford, but one-loaned out only on special occasions - featured a profusely</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">illustrated tale in which Popeye, Bluto, and even Wimpy the hamburger fiend took turns shtupping Olive</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Oyl). There were craft items as well, including the crayons Delacroix later put to some good use. Not that</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">he was our problem yet; this was earlier, remember. Also in the restraint room was the jacket no one</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">wanted to wear - white, made of double-sewn canvas, and with the buttons and snaps and buckles going</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">up the back. We all knew how to zip a problem child into that jacket lickety-larrup. They didn't get</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">violent often, our lost boys, but when they did, brother, you didn't wait around for the situation to</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="168" height="19" font="3">improve on its own.</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Brutal reached into the desk drawer above the kneehole and brought out the big leather-bound book with</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">the word VISITORS stamped on the front in gold leaf. Ordinarily, that book stayed in the drawer from</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">one month to the next. When a prisoner had visitors - unless it was a lawyer or a minister - he went over</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">to the room off the messhall that was kept special for that purpose. The Arcade, we called it. I don't know</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="41" height="19" font="3">why.</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just what in the Gorry do you think <i>you're</i> doing?&#34; Dean Stanton asked, peering over the tops of his</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">spectacles as Brutal opened the book and paged grandly past years of visitors to men now dead.</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Obeyin Regulation 19,&#34; Brutal said, finding the current page. He took the pencil and licked the tip - a</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">disagreeable habit of which he could not be broken - and prepared to write. Regulation 19 stated simply:</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">&#34;Each visitor to E Block shall show a yellow Administration pass and shall be recorded <i>without </i>fail&#34;</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="292" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's gone nuts,&#34; Dean said to me.</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;He didn't show us his pass, but I'm gonna let it go this time,&#34; Brutal said. He gave the tip of his pencil an</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="791" height="19" font="3">extra lick for good luck, then filled in 9:49 p.m. under the column headed TIME ON BLOCK.</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure, why not, the big bosses probably make exceptions for mice,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Course they do,&#34; Brutal agreed. &#34;Lack of pockets.&#34; He turned to look at the wall-clock behind the desk,</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">then printed 10:01 in the column headed TIME OFF BLOCK. The longer space between these two</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">numbers was headed NAME OF VISITOR. After a moment's hard thought - probably to muster his</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">limited spelling skills, as I'm sure the idea was in his head already - Brutus Howell carefully wrote</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">STEAMBOAT WILLY, which was what most people called Mickey Mouse back in those days. It was</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">because of that first talkie cartoon, where he rolled his eyes and bumped his hips around and pulled the</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="398" height="19" font="3">whistle cord in the pilothouse of the steamboat.</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;There,&#34; Brutal said, slamming the book closed and returning it to its drawer, &#34;all done and buttoned up.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="28" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">I laughed, but Dean, who couldn't help being serious about things even when he saw the joke, was</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">frowning and polishing his glasses furiously. &#34;You'll be in trouble if someone sees that.&#34; He hesitated and</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">added, &#34;The wrong someone.&#34; He hesitated again, looking nearsightedly around almost as if he expected</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">to see that the walls had grown ears, before finishing: &#34;Someone like Percy</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="374" height="19" font="3">Kiss-My-Ass-and-Go-to-Heaven Wetmore.&#34;</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Huh,&#34; Brutal said. - The day Percy Wetmore sits his narrow shanks down here at this desk will be the</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="113" height="19" font="3">day I resign.&#34;</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;You won't have to,&#34; Dean said. &#34;They'll fire you for making jokes in the visitors' book if Percy puts the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="491" height="19" font="3">right word in the right ear. And he can. You know he can!'</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Brutal glowered but said nothing. I reckoned that later on that night he would erase what he had written.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="212" height="19" font="3">And if he didn't, I would.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">The next night, after getting first Bitterbuck and then The President over to D Block, where we showered</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">our group after the regular cons were locked down, Brutal asked me if we shouldn't have a look for</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="422" height="19" font="3">Steamboat Willy down there in the restraint room.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;I guess we ought to,&#34; I said. We'd had a good laugh over that mouse the night before, but I knew that if</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Brutal and I found it down there in the restraint room - particularly if we found it had gnawed itself the</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">beginnings of a nest in one of the padded walls - we would kill it. Better to kill the scout, no matter how</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">amusing it might be, than have to live with the pilgrims. And, I shouldn't have to tell you, neither of us</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">was very squeamish about a little mouse-murder. Killing rats was what the state paid us for, after all.</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">But we didn't find Steamboat Willy - later to be known as Mr. Jingles - that night, not nested in the soft</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">walls, or behind any of the collected junk we hauled out into the corridor. There was a great deal of junk,</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">too, more than I would have expected, because we hadn't had to use the restraint room in a long time.</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">That would change with the advent of William Wharton, but of course we didn't know that at the time.</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="83" height="19" font="3">Lucky us.</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where'd it go?&#34; Brutal asked at last, wiping sweat off the back of his neck with a big blue bandanna.</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;No hole, no crack ... there's that, but - &#34; He pointed to the drain in the floor. Below the grate, which the</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">mouse could have gotten through, was a fine steel mesh that not even a fly would have passed. &#34;How'd it</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="215" height="19" font="3">get in? How'd it get out?&#34;</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="184" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">&#34;He <i>did</i> come in here, didn't he? I mean, the three of us saw him.&#34;</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="588" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep, right under the door. He had to squeeze a little, but he made it.&#34;</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">&#34;Gosh,&#34; Brutal said - a word that sounded strange, coming from a man that big. &#34;It's a good thing the</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="436" height="19" font="3">cons can't make themselves small like that, isn't it?&#34;</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">&#34;You bet,&#34; I said, running my eye over the canvas walls one last time, looking for a hole, a crack,</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">anything. There was nothing. &#34;Come on. Let's go.&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Steamboat Willy showed up again three nights later, when Harry Terwilliger was on the duty desk. Percy</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">was also on, and chased the mouse back down the Green Mile with the same mop Dean had been</text>
</page>
<page number="29" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">thinking of using. The rodent avoided Percy easily, slipping through the crack beneath the restraint-room</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">door a hands-down winner. Cursing at the top of his voice, Percy unlocked the door and hauled all that</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">shit out again. It was funny and scary at the same time, Harry said. Percy was vowing he'd catch the</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">goddam mouse and tear its diseased little head right off, but he didn't, of course. Sweaty and disheveled,</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">the shirttail of his uniform hanging out in the back, he returned to the duty desk half an hour later,</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">brushing his hair out of his eyes and telling Harry (who had sat serenely reading through most of the</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">ruckus) that he was going to put a strip of insulation on the bottom of the door down there; that would</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="327" height="19" font="3">solve the vermin problem, he declared.</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">&#34;Whatever you think is best, Percy,&#34; Harry said, turning a page of the oat opera he was reading. He</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">thought Percy would forget about blocking the crack at the bottom of that door, and he was right.</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>8.</b></text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Late that winter, long after these events were over, Brutal came to me one night when it was just the two</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">of us, E Block temporarily empty and all the other guards temporarily reassigned. Percy had gone on to</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="104" height="19" font="3">Briar Ridge.</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come here,&#34; Brutal said in a funny, squeezed voice that made me look around at him sharply. I had just</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">come in out of a cold and sleety night, and had been brushing off the shoulders of my coat prior to</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="116" height="19" font="3">hanging it up.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="264" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is something wrong?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; he said, &#34;but I found out where Mr. Jingles was staying. When he first came, I mean, before</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="396" height="19" font="3">Delacroix took him over. Do you want to see?&#34;</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Of course I did. I followed him down the Green Mile to the restraint room. All the stuff we kept stored</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">there was out in the hall; Brutal had apparently taken advantage of the lull in customer traffic to do some</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">cleaning up. The door was open, and I saw our mop-bucket inside. The floor, that same sick lime shade</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">as the Green Mile itself, was drying in streaks. Standing in the middle of the floor was a stepladder, the</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">one that was usually kept in the storage room, which also happened to serve as the final stop for the</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">state's condemned. There was a shelf jutting out from the back of the ladder near the top, the sort of thing</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">a workman would use to hold his toolkit or a painter the bucket he was working out of. There was a</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="326" height="19" font="3">flashlight on it. Brutal handed it to me.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get on up there. You're shorter than me, so you'll have to go pretty near all the way, but I'll hold your</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="49" height="19" font="3">legs!&#34;</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="569" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm ticklish down there,&#34; I said, starting up. &#34;Especially my knees!'</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="132" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll mind that!&#34;</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;Good,&#34; I said, &#34;because a broken hip's too high a price to pay in order to discover the origins of a single</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="69" height="19" font="3">mouse.&#34;</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="63" height="19" font="3">&#34;Huh?&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Never mind.&#34; My head was up by the caged light in the center of the ceiling by then, and I could feel the</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">ladder wiggling a little under my weight. Outside, I could hear the winter wind moaning. &#34;Just hold onto</text>

<page number="30" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="39" height="19" font="3">me.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;I got you, don't worry.&#34; He gripped my calves firmly, and I went up one more step. Now the top of my</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">head was less than a foot from the ceiling, and I could see the cobwebs a few enterprising spiders had</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">spun in the crotches where the roof beams came together. I shone the light around but didn't see anything</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="264" height="19" font="3">worth the risk of being up here.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">'No,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;You're looking too far away, Paul. Look to your left, where those two beams come</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="418" height="19" font="3">together. You see them? One's a little discolored!'</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">&#34;I see.&#34;</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="242" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shine the light on the join!&#34;</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">I did, and saw what he wanted me to see almost right away. The beams had been pegged together with</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">dowels, half a dozen of them, and one was gone, leaving a black, circular hole the size of a quarter. I</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">looked at it, then looked doubtfully back over my shoulder at Brutal. &#34;It was a small mouse,&#34; I said, &#34;but</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="285" height="19" font="3">that small? Man, I don't think so.&#34;</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="570" height="19" font="3">&#34;But that's where he went,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I'm just as sure as houses.&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="245" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't see how you can be.&#34;</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lean closer - don't worry I got you - and take a whiff.&#34;</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I did as he asked, groping with my left hand for one of the other beams, and feeling a little better when I</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">had hold of it. The wind outside gusted again; air puffed out of that hole and into my face. I could smell</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="702" height="19" font="3">the keen breath of a winter night in the border South ... and something else, as well.</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="212" height="19" font="3">The smell of peppermint.</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="4"><i>Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingles,</i> I could hear Delacroix saying in a voice that wouldn't stay</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">steady I could hear that, and I could feel the warmth of Mr. Jingles as the Frenchman handed it to me,</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">just a mouse, smarter than most of the species, no doubt, but still just a mouse for a' that and a' that. <i>Don't</i></text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="4"><i>let that bad 'un hurt my mouse,</i> he'd said, and I had promised, as I always promised them at the end when</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">walking the Green Mile was no longer a myth or a hypothesis but something they really had to do. Mail</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">this letter to my brother, who I haven't seen for twenty years? I promise. Say fifteen Hail Marys for my</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">soul? I promise. Let me die under my spirit-name and see that it goes on my tombstone? I promise. It was</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">the way you got them to go and be good about it, the way you saw them into the chair sitting at the end</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">of the Green Mile with their sanity intact. I couldn't keep all of those promises, of course, but I kept the</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">one I made to Delacroix. As for the Frenchman himself, there had been hell to pay. The bad 'un had hurt</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Delacroix, hurt him plenty. Oh, I know what he did, all right, but no one deserved what happened to</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">Eduard Delacroix when he fell into Old Sparky's savage embrace.</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="195" height="19" font="3">A smell of peppermint.</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="452" height="19" font="3">And something else. Something back inside that hole.</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">I took a pen out of my breast pocket with my right hand, still holding onto the beam with my left, not</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">worried anymore about Brutal inadvertently tickling my sensitive knees. I unscrewed the pen's cap</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">onehanded, then poked the nib in and teased something out. It was a tiny splinter of wood which had</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">been tinted a bright yellow, and I heard Delacroix's voice again, so clearly this time that his ghost might</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">have been lurking in that room with us - the one where William Wharton spent so much of his time.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="4"><i>Hey, you guys!</i> the voice said this time-the laughing, amazed voice of a man who has forgotten, at least</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="763" height="19" font="3">for a little while, where he is and what awaits him. <i>Come and see what Mr. Jingles can do!</i></text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="595" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ,&#34; I whispered. I felt as if the wind had been knocked out of me.</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="630" height="19" font="3">&#34;You found another one, didn't you?&#34; Brutal asked. &#34;I found three or four.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">I came down and shone the light on his big, outstretched palm. Several splinters of wood were scattered</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">there, like jackstraws for elves. Two were yellow, like the one I had found. One was green and one was</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="584" height="19" font="3">red. They hadn't been painted but colored, with wax Crayola crayons.</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, boy,&#34; I said in a low, shaky voice. &#34;Oh, hey. It's pieces of that spool, isn't it? But why? Why up</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">there?&#34;</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;When I was a kid I wasn't big like I am now,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I got most of my growth between fifteen and</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">seventeen. Until then I was a shrimp. And when I went off to school the first time, I felt as small as ...</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">why, as small as a mouse, I guess you'd say. I was scared to death. So you know what I did?&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I shook my head. Outside, the wind gusted again. In the angles formed by the beams, cobwebs shook in</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">feathery drafts, like rotted lace. Never had I been in a place that felt so nakedly haunted, and it was right</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">then, as we stood there looking down at the splintered remains of the spool which had caused so much</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">trouble, that my head began to know what my heart had understood ever since John Coffey had walked</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">the Green Mile: I couldn't do this job much longer. Depression, or no Depression, I couldn't watch many</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="718" height="19" font="3">more men walk through my office to their deaths. Even one more might be too many.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;I asked my mother for one of her hankies,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;So when I felt weepy and small, I could sneak</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">it out and smell her perfume and not feel so bad.&#34;</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;You think - what? - that mouse chewed off some of that colored spool to remember Delacroix by? That</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="89" height="19" font="3">a <i>mouse -&#34;</i></text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">He looked up. I thought for a moment I saw tears in his eyes, but I guess I was probably wrong about</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">that. &#34;I ain't saying nothing, Paul. But I found them up there, and I smelled peppermint, same as you -</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">you know you did. And I can't do this no more. I <i>won't</i> do this no more. Seeing one more man in that</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">chair'd just about kill me. I'm going to put in for a transfer to Boys' Correctional on Monday. If I get it</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="640" height="19" font="3">before the next one, that's fine. If I don't, I'll resign and go back to farming.&#34;</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">&#34;What did you ever farm, besides rocks?&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="140" height="19" font="3">&#34;It don't matter.&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="469" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know it doesn't,&#34; I said. &#34;I think I'll put in with you.-&#34;</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">He looked at me close, making sure I wasn't just having some sport with him, then nodded as if it was a</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">settled thing. The wind gusted again, strong enough this time to make the beams creak and settle, and we</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">both looked around uneasily at the padded walls. I think for a moment we could hear William Wharton -</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">not Billy the Kid, not him, he had been &#34;Wild Bill&#34; to us from his first day on the block - screaming and</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">laughing, telling us we were going to be damned glad to be rid of him, telling us we would never forget</text>

<text top="74" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">As for what Brutal and I agreed on that night in the restraint room, it turned out just that way It was</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">almost as if we had taken a solemn oath on those tiny bits of colored, wood. Neither of us ever took part</text>

<text top="581" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">There's even a fellow here who reminds me a little of Percy Wetmore, who got his job on the Green Mile</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">because he was related to the governor of the state. I doubt if this fellow is related to anyone important,</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">even though he acts that way. Brad Dolan, his name is. He's always combing his hair, like Percy was, and</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">he's always got something to read stuffed into his back pocket. With Percy it was magazines like Argosy</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">and <i>Men's Adventure;</i> with Brad it's these little paperbacks called Gross jokes and Sick jokes. He's</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">always asking people why the Frenchman crossed the road or how many Polacks it takes to screw in a</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">lightbulb or how many pallbearers there are at a Harlem funeral. Like Percy, Brad is a dimwit who thinks</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="280" height="19" font="3">nothing is funny unless it's mean.</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Something Brad said the other day struck me as actually smart, but I don't give him a lot of credit for it;</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">even a stopped clock is right twice a day, the proverb has it. &#34;You're just lucky you don't have that</text>

<text top="860" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">anyway; I've given up asking him to quit. There are other sayings - not quite proverbs - that apply to</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Brad Dolan: &#34;You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink&#34; is one; &#34;You can dress him up</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="693" height="19" font="3">but you can't take him out&#34; is another. In his thickheadedness he is also like Percy.</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">When he made his comment about Alzheimer's, he was mopping the floor of the solarium, where I had</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">been going over the pages I have already written. There's a great lot of them, and I think there's apt to be</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="742" height="19" font="3">a great lot more before I am through. &#34;That Alzheimer's, do you know what it really is?&#34;</text>

<text top="1073" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's AIDS for old people,&#34; he said, and then burst out laughing, hucka-hucka-hucka-huck!, just like he</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">I didn't laugh, though, because what he said struck a nerve somewhere. Not that I have Alzheimer's;</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">although there's plenty of it on view here at beautiful Georgia Pines, I myself just suffer the standard</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">oldguy memory problems. Those problems seem to have more to do with when than what. Looking over</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">what I have written so far, it occurs to me that I <i>remember</i> everything that happened back in '32; it's the</text>

<text top="155" left="15" width="204" height="19" font="3">sorted out. More or less.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">John Coffey came to E Block and the Green Mile in October of that year, condemned for the murder of</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">the nine-year-old Detterick twins. That's my major landmark, and if I keep it in view, I should do just</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">fine. William 'Wild Bill&#34; Wharton came after Coffey; Delacroix came before. So did the mouse, the one</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">Brutus Howell - Brutal, to his friends - called Steamboat Willy and Delacroix ended up calling Mr.</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">Jingles.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Whatever you called him, the mouse came first, even before Del - it was still summer when he showed</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">up, and we had two other prisoners on the Green Mile: The Chief, Arlen Bitterbuck; and The Pres,</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="139" height="19" font="3">Arthur Flanders.</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">That mouse. That goddam mouse. Delacroix loved it, but Percy Wetmore sure didn't.</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="237" height="19" font="3">Percy hated it from the first.</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>2.</b></text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">The mouse came back just about three days after Percy had chased it down the Green Mile that first time.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">Dean Stanton and Bill Dodge were talking politics, which meant in those days, they were talking</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">Roosevelt and Hoover - Herbert, not J. Edgar. They were eating Ritz crackers from a box Dean had</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">purchased from old Toot-Toot an hour or so before. Percy was standing in the office doorway, practicing</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">quick draws with the baton he loved so much, as he listened. He'd pull it out of that ridiculous handtooled</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">holster he'd gotten somewhere, then twirl it (or try to; most times he would have dropped it if not for the</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">rawhide loop he kept on his wrist), then re-holster it. I was off that night, but got the full report from</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="239" height="19" font="3">Dean the following evening.</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">The mouse came up the Green Mile just as it had before, hopping along, then stopping and seeming to</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">check the empty cells. After a bit of that it would hop on, undiscouraged, as if it had known all along it</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="379" height="19" font="3">would be a long search, and it was up to that.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">The President was awake this time, standing at his cell door. That guy was a piece of work, managing to</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">look natty even in his prison blues. We knew just by the way he looked that he wasn't made for Old</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Sparky, and we were right - less than a week after Percy's second run at that mouse, The Pres's sentence</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="498" height="19" font="3">was commuted to life and he joined the general population.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Say!&#34; he called. ''There's a mouse in here! What kind of a joint are you guys running, anyway?&#34; He was</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">kind of laughing, but Dean said he also sounded kind of outraged, as if even a murder rap hadn't been</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">quite enough to knock the Kiwanis out of his soul. He had been the regional head of an outfit called</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Mid-South Realty Associates, and had thought himself smart enough to be able to get away with pushing</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">had re-holstered his baton and taken out one of his magazines, but now he tossed the magazine on the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">duty desk and pulled the baton out of its holster again. He began tapping it casually against the knuckles</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="132" height="19" font="3">of his left hand.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">&#34;Son of a bitch,&#34; Bill Dodge said. &#34;I've never seen a mouse in here before.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="485" height="19" font="3">&#34;Aw, he's sort of cute,&#34; Dean said. &#34;And not afraid at all.&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="182" height="19" font="3">&#34;How do you know?&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="697" height="19" font="3">&#34;He was in the other night. Percy saw him, too. Brutal calls him Steamboat Willy.&#34;</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Percy kind of sneered at that, but for the time being said nothing. He was tapping the baton faster now on</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="174" height="19" font="3">the back of his hand.</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Watch this,&#34; Dean said. &#34;He came all the way up to the desk before. I want to see if he'll do it again.&#34;</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">It did, skirting wide of The Pres on its way, as if it didn't like the way our resident parricide smelled. It</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">checked two of the empty cells, even ran up onto one of the bare, unmattressed cots for a sniff, then came</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">back to the Green Mile. And Percy standing there the whole time, tapping and tapping, not talking for a</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="667" height="19" font="3">change, wanting to make it sorry for coming back. Wanting to teach it a lesson.</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;Good thing you guys don't have to put him in Sparky,&#34; Bill said, interested in spite of himself. &#34;You'd</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="471" height="19" font="3">have a hell of a time getting the clamps and the cap on.&#34;</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Percy said nothing still, but he very slowly gripped the baton between his fingers, the way a man would</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="152" height="19" font="3">hold a good cigar.</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">The mouse stopped where it had before, no more than three feet from the duty desk, looking up at Dean</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">like a prisoner before the bar. It glanced up at Bill for a moment, then switched its attention back to</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="377" height="19" font="3">Dean. Percy it hardly seemed to notice at all.</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's a brave little barstid, I got to give him that,&#34; Bill said. He raised his voice a little. &#34;Hey! Hey!</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="157" height="19" font="3">Steamboat Willy!&#34;</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">The mouse flinched a little and fluttered its ears, but it didn't run, or even show any signs of wanting to.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Now watch this,&#34; Dean said, remembering how Brutal had fed it some of his corned-beef sandwich. &#34;I</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="298" height="19" font="3">don't know if he'll do it again, but-&#34;</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">He broke off a piece of Ritz cracker and dropped it in front of the mouse. It just looked with its sharp</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">black eyes at the orangey fragment for a second or two, its filament-fine whiskers twitching as it sniffed.</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="616" height="19" font="3">Then it reached out, took the cracker in its paws, sat up, and began to eat.</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well. I'll be shucked and boiled!&#34; Bill exclaimed. &#34;Eats as neat as a parson on parish house Saturday</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="59" height="19" font="3">night!&#34;</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Looks more like a nigger eating watermelon to me.&#34;. Percy remarked, but neither guard paid him any</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">mind. Neither did The Chief or The Pres, for that matter. The mouse finished the cracker but continued to</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="718" height="19" font="3">sit, seemingly balanced on the talented coil of its tail, looking up at the giants in blue.</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lemme try,&#34; Bill said. He broke off another piece of cracker, leaned over the front of the desk, and</text>
</page>
<page number="35" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="486" height="19" font="3">dropped it carefully. The mouse sniffed but did not touch.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="270" height="19" font="3">&#34;Huh,&#34; Bill said. &#34;Must be full.&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="470" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nah,&#34; Dean said, &#34;he knows you're a floater, that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="739" height="19" font="3">&#34;Floater, am I? I like that! I'm here almost as much as Harry Terwilliger! Maybe more!&#34;</text>
<text top="191" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;Simmer down, old-timer, simmer down,&#34; Dean said, grinning. &#34;But watch and see if I'm not right.&#34; He</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">bombed another piece of cracker over the side. Sure enough, the mouse picked that one up and began to</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">eat again, still ignoring Bill Dodge's contribution completely. But before it had done more than take a</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="662" height="19" font="3">preliminary nibble or two, Percy threw his baton at it, launching it like a spear.</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">The mouse was a small target, and give the devil his due-it was a wickedly good shot, and might have</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">taken &#34;Willy's&#34; head clean off, if its reflexes hadn't been as sharp as shards of broken glass. It ducked -</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">yes, just as a human being would have - and dropped the chunk of cracker. The heavy hickory baton</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">passed over its head and spine close enough so its fur ruffled (that's what Dean said, anyway, and so I</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">pass it on, although I'm not sure I really believe it), then hit the green linoleum and bounced against the</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">bars of an empty cell. The mouse didn't wait to see if it was a mistake; apparently remembering a</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">pressing engagement elsewhere, it turned and was off down the corridor toward the restraint room in a</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="46" height="19" font="3">flash.</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Percy roared with frustration - he knew how close he had come - and chased after it again. Bill Dodge</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">grabbed at his arm, probably out of simple instinct, but Percy pulled away from him. Still, Dean said, it</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">was probably that grab which saved Steamboat Willy's life, and it was still a near thing. Percy wanted not</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">just to kill the mouse but to <i>squash</i> it, so he ran in big, comical leaps, like a deer, stamping down with his</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">heavy black workshoes. The mouse barely avoided Percy's last two jumps, first zigging and then zagging.</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">It went under the door with a final flick of its long pink tail, and so long, stranger - it was gone.</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Fuck!&#34;</i> Percy said, and slammed the flat of his hand against the door. Then he began to sort through his</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="563" height="19" font="3">keys, meaning to go into the restraint room and continue the chase.</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Dean came down the corridor after him, deliberately walking slow in order to get his emotions under</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">control. Part of him wanted to laugh at Percy, he told me, but part of him wanted to grab the man, whirl</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">him around, pin him against the restraint-room door, and whale the living daylights out of him. Most of</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">it, of course, was just being startled; our job on E Block was to keep rumpus to a minimum, and rumpus</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">was practically Percy Wetmore's middle name. Working with him was sort of like trying to defuse a</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">bomb with somebody standing behind you and every now and then clashing a pair of cymbals together.</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">In a word, upsetting. Dean said he could see that upset in Arlen Bitterbucks eyes ... even in The</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="724" height="19" font="3">President's eyes, although that gentleman was usually as cool as the storied cucumber.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">And there was something else, as well. In some part of his mind, Dean had already begun to accept the</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">mouse as - well, maybe not as a friend, but as a part of life on the block. That made what Percy had done</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">and what he was trying to do not right. Not even if it was a mouse he was trying to do it to. And the fact</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">that Percy would never understand how come it wasn't right was pretty much the perfect example of why</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="451" height="19" font="3">he was all wrong for the job he thought he was doing.</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">By the time Dean reached the end of the corridor, he had gotten himself under control again, and knew</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">how he wanted to handle the matter. The one thing Percy absolutely couldn't stand was to look foolish,</text>
</page>
<page number="36" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="159" height="19" font="3">and we all knew it.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="578" height="19" font="3">&#34;Coises, foiled again,&#34; he said, grinning a little, kidding Percy along.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Percy gave him an ugly look and flicked his hair off his brow. &#34;Match your mouth, Four-Eyes. I'm riled.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="184" height="19" font="3">Don't make it worse!&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;So it's moving day again, is it?&#34; Dean said, not quite laughing ... but laughing with his eyes. &#34;Well,</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="641" height="19" font="3">when you get everything out this time, would you mind mopping the floor?&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Percy looked at the door. Looked at his keys. Thought about another long, hot, fruitless rummage in the</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">room with the soft walls while they all stood around and watched him ... The Chief and The Pres, too.</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll be damned if I understand what's so funny,&#34; he said. &#34;We don't need mice in the cellblock - we got</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="454" height="19" font="3">enough vermin in here already, without adding mice.&#34;</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;Whatever you say, Percy,&#34; Dean said, holding up his hands. He had a moment right there, he told me the</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="512" height="19" font="3">next night, when he believed Percy might just take after him.</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Bill Dodge strolled up then and smoothed it over. &#34;Think you dropped this,&#34; he said, and handed Percy</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="596" height="19" font="3">his baton. &#34;An inch lower, you woulda broken the little barstid's back.&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="776" height="19" font="3">Percy's chest expanded at that. &#34;Yeah, it wasn't a bad shot , &#34; he said, carefully re-seating his</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">headknocker in its foolish holster. &#34;I used to be a pitcher in high school. Threw two no-hitters.&#34;</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is that right, now?&#34; Bill said, and the respectful tone of voice (although he winked at Dean when Percy</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="481" height="19" font="3">turned away) was enough to finish defusing the situation.</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep,&#34; Percy said. &#34;Threw one down in Knoxville. Those city boys didn't know what hit em. Walked</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">two. Could have had a perfect game if the ump hadn't been such a lugoon.&#34;</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Dean could have left it at that, but he had seniority on Percy and part of a senior's job is to instruct, and at</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">that time - before Coffey, before Delacroix - he still thought Percy might be teachable. So he reached out</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">and grasped the younger man's wrist. &#34;You want to think about what you was doing just now,&#34; Dean</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">said. His intention, he said later, was to sound serious but not disapproving. Not too disapproving,</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="71" height="19" font="3">anyway.</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="704" height="19" font="3">Except with Percy, that didn't work. He might not learn ... but we would eventually.</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="760" height="19" font="3">&#34;Say, Four-Eyes, I know what I was doing - trying to get that mouse! What're you, blind?&#34;</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;You also scared the cheese out of Bill, out of me, and out of them,&#34; Dean said, pointing in the direction</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="230" height="19" font="3">of Bitterbuck and Flanders.</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;So what?&#34; Percy asked, drawing himself up. &#34;They ain't in cradle-school, in case you didn't notice.</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="453" height="19" font="3">Although you guys treat them that way half the time.&#34;</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, I don't like to be scared,&#34; Bill rumbled, &#34;and I work here, Wetmore, in case you didn't notice. I</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="223" height="19" font="3">ain't one of your lugoons.&#34;</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="565" height="19" font="3">Percy gave him a look that was narrow-eyed and a touch uncertain.</text>
</page>
<page number="37" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;And we don't scare them any more than we have to, because they're under a lot of strain,&#34; Dean said. He</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">was still keeping his voice low. &#34;Men that are under a lot of strain can snap. Hurt themselves. Hurt</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="431" height="19" font="3">others. Sometimes get folks like us in trouble, too.&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Percy's mouth twitched at that. &#34;In trouble&#34; was an idea that had power over him. Making trouble was</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="244" height="19" font="3">okay. Getting into it was not.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;Our job is talking, not yelling,&#34; Dean said. &#34;A man who is yelling at prisoners is a man who has lost</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="73" height="19" font="3">control.&#34;</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">Percy knew who had written that scripture - me.</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">The boss. There was no love lost between Percy Wetmore and Paul Edgecombe, and this was still</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="498" height="19" font="3">summer, remember - long before the real festivities started.</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;You'll do better,&#34; Dean said, &#34;if you think of this place as like an intensive-care ward in a hospital. It's</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="157" height="19" font="3">best to be quiet--!&#34;</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="779" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think of it as a bucket of piss to drown rats in,&#34; Percy said, &#34;and that's all. Now let me go.&#34;</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">He tore free of Dean's hand, stepped between him and Bill, and stalked up the corridor with his head</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">down. He walked a little too close to The President's side - close enough so that Flanders could have</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">reached out, grabbed him, and maybe headwhipped him with his own prized hickory baton, had Flanders</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">been that sort of man. He wasn't, of course, but The Chief perhaps was. The Chief, if given a chance,</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">might have administered such a beating just to teach Percy a lesson. What Dean said to me on that</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">subject when he told me this story the following night has stuck with me ever since, because it turned out</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">to be a kind of prophecy. &#34;Wetmore don't understand that he hasn't got any power over them,&#34; Dean said.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;That nothing he does can really make things worse for them, that they can only be electrocuted once.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Until he gets his head around that, he's going to be a danger to himself and to everyone else down here.&#34;</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="515" height="19" font="3">Percy went into my office and slammed the door behind him.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="652" height="19" font="3">&#34;My, my,&#34; Bill Dodge said. &#34;Ain't he the swollen and badly infected testicle.&#34;</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="359" height="19" font="3">&#34;You don't know the half of it,&#34; Dean said.</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, look on the bright side,&#34; Bill said. He was always telling people to look on the bright side; it got so</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">you wanted to punch his nose every time it came out of his mouth. &#34;Your trick mouse got away, at least.&#34;</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, but we won't see him no more,&#34; Dean said. &#34;I imagine this time goddam Percy Wetmore's scared</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="153" height="19" font="3">him off for good.&#34;</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>3.</b></text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">That was logical but wrong. The mouse was back the very next evening, which just happened to be the</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="680" height="19" font="3">first of Percy Wetmore's two nights off before he slid over to the graveyard shift.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">Steamboat Willy showed up around seven o'clock. I was there to see his reappearance; so was Dean.</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger, too. Harry was on the desk. I was technically on days, but had stuck around to spend</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">an extra hour with The Chief, whose time was getting close by then. Bitterbuck was stoical on the</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">outside, in the tradition of his tribe, but I could see his fear of the end growing inside him like a poison</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">flower. So we talked. You could talk to them in the daytime but it wasn't so good, with the shouts and</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="751" height="19" font="3">conversation (not to mention the occasional fist-fight) coming from the exercise yard, the</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">chonk-chonk-chonk of the stamping machines in the plate-shop, the occasional yell of a guard for</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">someone to put down that pick or grab up that hoe or just to get your ass over here, Harvey. After four it</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">got a little better, and after six it got better still. Six to eight was the optimum time. After that you could</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">see the long thoughts starting to steal over their minds again - in their eyes you could see it, like</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">afternoon shadows and it was best to stop. They still heard what you were saying, but it no longer made</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">sense to them. Past eight they were getting ready for the watches of the night and imagining how the cap</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">would feel when it was clamped to the tops of their heads, and how the air would smell inside the black</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="477" height="19" font="3">bag which had been rolled down over their sweaty faces.</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">But I got The Chief at a good time. He told me about his first wife, and how they had built a lodge</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">together up in Montana. Those had been the happiest days of his life, he said. The water was so pure and</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="545" height="19" font="3">so cold that it felt like your mouth was cut every time you drank.</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey, Mr. Edgecombe,&#34; he said. &#34;You think, if a man he sincerely repent of what he done wrong, he</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">might get to go back to the time that was happiest for him and live there forever? Could that be what</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="133" height="19" font="3">heaven is like?&#34;</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;I've just about believed that very thing,&#34; I said, which was a he I didn't regret in the least. I had learned</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">of matters eternal at my mother's pretty knee, and what I believed is what the Good Book says about</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">murderers: that there is no eternal life in them. I think they go straight to hell, where they burn in torment</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">until God finally gives Gabriel the nod to blow the Judgment Trump. When he does, they'll wink out ...</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">and probably glad to go they will be. But I never gave a hint of such beliefs to Bitterbuck, or to any of</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">them. I think in their hearts they knew it. Where is your brother, his blood crieth to me from the ground,</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">God said to Cain, and I doubt if the words were much of a surprise to that particular problem-child; I bet</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">he heard Abel's blood whining out of the earth at him with each step he took.</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">The Chief was smiling when I left, perhaps thinking about his lodge in Montana and his wife lying</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">bare-breasted in the light of the fire. He would be walking in a warmer fire soon, I had no doubt.</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I went back up the corridor, and Dean told me about his set-to with Percy the previous night. I think he'd</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">waited around just so he could, and I listened carefully. I always listened carefully when the subject was</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Percy, because I agreed with Dean a hundred per cent - I thought Percy was the sort of man who could</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="525" height="19" font="3">cause a lot of trouble, as much for the rest of us as for himself.</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">As Dean was finishing, old Toot-Toot came by with his red snack-wagon, which was covered with</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">handlettered Bible quotes (&#34;REPENT for the LORD shall judge his people,&#34; Deut. 32:36, &#34;And surely</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">your BLOOD of your lives will I require,&#34; Gen. 9:5, and similar cheery, uplifting sentiments), and sold</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">us some sandwiches and pops. Dean was hunting for change in his pocket and saying that we wouldn't</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">see Steamboat Willy anymore, that goddam Percy Wetmore had scared him off for good, when old</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="328" height="19" font="3">Toot-Toot said, 'What's that'ere, then?&#34;</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">We looked, and here came the mouse of the hour his ownself, hopping up the middle of the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">He'd come a little way; then stop, look around with his bright little oildrop eyes, then come on again.</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey, mouse!&#34; The Chief said, and the mouse stopped and looked at him, whiskers twitching. I tell you,</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">it was exactly as if the damned thing knew it had been called. &#34;You some kind of spirit guide?&#34;</text>

<page number="39" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Bitterbuck tossed the mouse a little morsel of cheese from his supper. It landed right in front of the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">mouse, but Steamboat Willy hardly even glanced at it, just came on his way again, up the Green Mile,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="193" height="19" font="3">looking in empty cells.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Boss Edgecombe!&#34; The. President called. &#34;Do you think that little bastard knows Wetmore isn't here? I</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="109" height="19" font="3">do, by God!&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="507" height="19" font="3">I felt about the same ... but I wasn't going to say so out loud.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Harry came out into the hall, hitching up his pants the way he always did after he'd spent a refreshing few</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">minutes in the can, and stood there with his eyes wide. Toot-Toot was also staring, a sunken grin doing</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="540" height="19" font="3">unpleasant things to the soft and toothless lower half of his face.</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">The mouse stopped in what was becoming its usual spot, curled its tail around its paws, and looked at us.</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Again I was reminded of pictures I had seen of judges passing sentence on hapless prisoners ... yet, had</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">there ever been a prisoner as small and unafraid as this one? Not that it really was a prisoner, of course; it</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">could come and go pretty much as it pleased. Yet the idea would not leave my mind, and it again</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">occurred to me that most of us would feel that small when approaching God's judgment seat after our</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="583" height="19" font="3">lives were over, but very few of us would be able to look so unafraid.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="653" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, I swear,&#34; Old Toot-Toot said. &#34;There he sits, big as Billy-Be-Frigged.&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;You ain't seen nothing yet, Toot,&#34; Harry said. &#34;atch this.&#34; He reached into his breast pocket and came</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">out with a slice of cinnamon apple wrapped in waxed paper. He broke off the end and tossed it on the</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">floor. It was dry and hard and I thought it would bounce right past the mouse, but it reached out one paw,</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">as carelessly as a man swatting at a fly to pass the time, and batted it flat. We all laughed in admiration</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">and surprise, an outburst of sound that should have sent the mouse skittering, but it barely twitched. It</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">picked up the piece of dried apple in its paws, gave it a couple of licks, then dropped it and looked up at</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="398" height="19" font="3">us as if to say, Not bad, what else do you have?</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="792" height="19" font="3">Toot-Toot opened his cart, took out a sandwich, unwrapped it, and tore off a scrap of bologna.</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="221" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't bother,&#34; Dean said.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">'What do you mean?&#34; Toot-Toot asked. &#34;Ain't a mouse alive'd pass up bologna if he could get it. You a</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="98" height="19" font="3">crazy guy!&#34;</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">But I knew Dean was right, and I could see by Harry's face that he knew it, too. There were floaters and</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="751" height="19" font="3">there were regulars. Somehow, that mouse seemed to know the difference. Nuts, but true.</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Old Toot-Toot tossed the scrap of bologna down, and sure enough, the mouse wouldn't have a thing to do</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="420" height="19" font="3">with it; sniffed it once and then backed off a pace.</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll be a goddamned son of a bitch,&#34; Old Toot-Toot said, sounding offended.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="302" height="19" font="3">I held out my hand. &#34;Give it to me.&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="220" height="19" font="3">&#34;What - same sammitch?&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="220" height="19" font="3">&#34;Same one. I'll pay for it.&#34;</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Toot-Toot handed it over. I lifted the top slice of bread, tore off another sliver of meat, and dropped it</text>
</page>
<page number="40" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">over the front of the duty desk. The mouse came forward at once. picked it up in its paws, and began to</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="539" height="19" font="3">eat. The bologna was gone before you could say Jack Robinson.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll be <i>goddamned!&#34;</i> Toot-Toot cried. &#34;Bloody hell! Gimme dat!&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">He snatched back the sandwich, tore off a much larger piece of meat - not a scrap this time but a flap -</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">and dropped it so close to the mouse that Steamboat Willy almost ended up wearing it for a hat. It drew</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">back again, sniffed (surely no mouse ever hit such a jackpot during the Depression - not in our state, at</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="266" height="19" font="3">least), and then looked up at us.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go on, eat it!&#34; Toot-Toot said, sounding more offended than ever. &#34;What's wrong witchoo?&#34;</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">Dean took the sandwich and dropped a piece of meat - by then it was like some strange communion</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">service. The mouse picked it up at once and bolted it down. Then it turned and went back down the</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">corridor to the restraint room, pausing along the way to peer into a couple of empty cells and to take a</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">brief investigatory tour of a third. Once again the idea that it was looking for someone occurred to me,</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="424" height="19" font="3">and this time I dismissed the thought more slowly.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm not going to talk about this,&#34; Harry said. He sounded as if he was half-joking, half-not. &#34;First of all,</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="517" height="19" font="3">nobody'd care. Second, they wouldn't believe me if they did.&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;He only ate from you fellas,&#34; Toot-Toot said. He shook his head in disbelief, then bent laboriously over,</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">picked up what the mouse had disdained, and popped it into his own toothless maw, where he be gan the</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="491" height="19" font="3">job of gumming it into submission. &#34;Now why he do dat?&#34;</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="571" height="19" font="3">&#34;I've got a better one,&#34; Harry said. &#34;How'd he know Percy was off?&#34;</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="645" height="19" font="3">&#34;He didn't,&#34; I said. &#34;It was just coincidence, that mouse showing up tonight.&#34;</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Except that got harder and harder to believe as the days went by and the mouse showed up only when</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">Percy was off, on another shift, or in another part of the prison. We - Harry, Dean, Brutal, and me -</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="447" height="19" font="3">decided that it must know Percy's voice, or his smell.</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">We carefully avoided too much discussion about the mouse itself - himself. That, we seemed to have</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">decided without saying a word, might go a long way toward spoiling something that was special, and</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">beautiful, by virtue of its strangeness and delicacy. Willy had chosen us, after all, in some way I do not</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">understand, even now. Maybe Harry came closest when he said it would do no good to tell other people,</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="588" height="19" font="3">not just because they wouldn't believe but because they wouldn't care.</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>4.</b></text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Then it was time for the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, in reality no chief but first elder of his tribe on</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">the Washita Reservation, and a member of the Cherokee Council as well. He had killed a man while</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">drunk - while both of them were drunk, in fact. The Chief had crushed the man's head with a cement</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">block. At issue had been a pair of boots. So, on July seventeenth of that rainy summer, my council of</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="283" height="19" font="3">elders intended for his life to end.</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Visiting hours for most Cold Mountain prisoners were as rigid as steel beams, but that didn't hold for our</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">boys on E Block. So, on the sixteenth, Bitterbuck was allowed over to the long room adjacent to the</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">cafeteria - the Arcade. It was divided straight down the middle by mesh interwoven with strands of</text>
</page>
<page number="41" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">barbed wire. Here The Chief would visit with his second wife and those of his children who would still</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="380" height="19" font="3">treat with him. It was time for the good-byes.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">He was taken over there by Bill Dodge and two other floaters. The rest of us had work to do - one hour to</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="511" height="19" font="3">cram in at least two rehearsals. Three, if we could manage it.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Percy didn't make much protest over being put in the switch room with Jack Van Hay for the Bitterbuck</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">electrocution; he was too green to know if he was being given a good spot or a bad one. What he did</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">know was that he had a rectangular mesh window to look through, and although he probably didn't care</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">to be looking at the back of the chair instead of the front, he would still be close enough to see the sparks</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="55" height="19" font="3">flying.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Right outside that window was a black wall telephone with no crank or dial on it. That phone could only</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">ring in, and only from one place: the governor's office. I've seen lots of jailhouse movies over the years</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">where the official phone rings just as they're getting ready to pull the switch on some poor innocent sap,</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">but ours never rang during all my years on E Block, never once. In the movies, salvation is cheap. So is</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">innocence. You pay a quarter, and a quarter's worth is just what you get. Real life costs more, and most</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="235" height="19" font="3">of the answers are different.</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">We had a tailor's dummy down in the tunnel for the run to the meatwagon, and we had Old Toot-Toot for</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">the rest. Over the years, Toot had somehow become the traditional stand-in for the condemned, as</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">time-honored in his way as the goose you sit down to on Christmas, whether you like goose or not. Most</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">of the other screws liked him, were amused by his funny accent - also French, but Canadian rather than</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Cajun, and softened into its own thing by his years of incarceration in the South. Even Brutal got a kick</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">out of Old Toot. Not me, though. I thought he was, in his way, an older and dimmer version of Percy</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Wetmore, a man too squeamish to kill and cook his own meat but who did, all the same, just love the</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="169" height="19" font="3">smell of a barbecue.</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">We were all there for the rehearsal, just as we would all be there for the main event. Brutus Howell had</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">been &#34;put out,&#34; as we said, which meant that he would place the cap, monitor the governor's phoneline,</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">summon the doctor from his place by the wall if he was needed, and give the actual order to roll on two</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">when the time came. If it went well, there would be no credit for anyone. If it didn't go well, Brutal</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">would be blamed by the witnesses and I would be blamed by the warden. Neither of us complained about</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">this; it wouldn't have done any good. The world turns, that's all. You can hold on and turn with it, or</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="340" height="19" font="3">stand up to protest and be spun right off.</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Dean, Harry Terwilliger, and I walked down to The Chief's cell for the first rehearsal not three minutes</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">after Bill and his troops had escorted Bitterbuck off the block and over to the Arcade. The cell door was</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="655" height="19" font="3">open, and Old Toot-Toot sat on The Chief's bunk, his wispy white hair flying.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;There come-stains all over dis sheet,&#34; Toot-Toot remarked. &#34;He mus' be tryin to get rid of it before you</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="287" height="19" font="3">fellas boil it off!&#34; And he cackled.</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="441" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up, Toot,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Let's play this serious.&#34;</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay,&#34; Toot-Toot said, immediately composing his face into an expression of thunderous gravity. But</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="672" height="19" font="3">his eyes twinkled. Old Toot never looked so alive as when he was playing dead.</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I stepped forward. &#34;Arlen Bitterbuck, as an officer of the court and of the state of blah-blah, I have a</text>

<page number="42" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">warrant for blah-blah, such execution to be carried out at twelve-oh-one on blah-blah, will you step</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="84" height="19" font="3">forward?&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">Toot got off the bunk. &#34;I'm steppin forward, I'm steppin forward, I'm steppin forward,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;Turn around,&#34; Dean said, and when Toot-Toot turned, Dean examined the dandruffy top of his head.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">The crown of The Chief's head would be shaved tomorrow night, and Dean's check then would be to</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">make sure he didn't need a touch-up. Stubble could impede conduction, make things harder. Everything</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="450" height="19" font="3">we were doing today was about making things easier.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="558" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right, Arlen, let's go,&#34; I said to Toot-Toot, and away we went.</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm walkin down the corridor, I'm walkin down the corridor, I'm walkin down the corridor,&#34; Toot said. I</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">flanked him on the left, Dean on the right. Harry was directly behind him. At the head of the corridor we</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">turned right, away from life as it was lived in the exercise yard and toward death as it was died in the</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">storage room. We went into my office, and Toot dropped to his knees without having to be asked. He</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">knew the script, all right, probably better than any of us. God knew he'd been there longer than any of us.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm prayin, I'm prayin, I'm prayin,&#34; Toot-Toot said, holding his gnarled hands up. They looked like that</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">famous engraving, you probably know the one I mean. &#34;The Lord is my shepherd, so on 'n so forth.&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who's Bitterbuck got?&#34; Harry asked. &#34;We're not going to have some Cherokee medicine man in here</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="220" height="19" font="3">shaking his dick, are we?&#34;</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="107" height="19" font="3">&#34;Actually - &#34;</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="610" height="19" font="3">&#34;Still prayin, still prayin, still gettin right with Jesus,&#34; Toot overrode me.</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="298" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up, you old gink,&#34; Dean said.</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="110" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm prayin!&#34;</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="204" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then pray to yourself.&#34;</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's keepin you guys?&#34; Brutal hollered in from the storage room. That had also been emptied for our</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="728" height="19" font="3">use. We were in the killing zone again, all right; it was a thing you could almost smell.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="667" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hold your friggin water!&#34; Harry yelled back. &#34;Don't be so goddam impatient!&#34;</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">&#34;Prayin,&#34; Toot said, grinning his unpleasant sunken grin. &#34;Prayin for patience, just a little goddam</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="84" height="19" font="3">patience.&#34;</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Actually, Bitterbuck's a Christian - he says,&#34; I told them, &#34;and he's perfectly happy with the Baptist guy</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">who came for Tillman Clark. Schuster, his name is. I like him, too. He's fast, and he doesn't get them all</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="547" height="19" font="3">worked up. On your feet, Toot. You prayed enough for one day.&#34;</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="723" height="19" font="3">&#34;Walkin,&#34; Toot said. &#34;Walkin again, walkin again, yes sir, walkin on the Green Mile.&#34;</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Short as he was, he still had to duck a little to get through the door on the far side of the office. The rest</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">of us had to duck even more. This was a vulnerable time with a real prisoner, and when I looked across</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">to the platform where Old Sparky stood and saw Brutal with his gun drawn, I nodded with satisfaction.</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="83" height="19" font="3">Just right.</text>
</page>
<page number="43" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="44" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">Toot-Toot went down the steps and stopped. The folding wooden chairs, about forty of them, were</text>
<text top="68" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">already in place. Bitterbuck would cross to the platform on an angle that would keep him safely away</text>
<text top="92" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">from the seated spectators, and half a dozen guards would be added for insurance. Bill Dodge would be</text>
<text top="116" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">in charge of those. We had never had a witness menaced by a condemned prisoner in spite of what was,</text>
<text top="140" left="15" width="517" height="19" font="3">admittedly, a raw set-up, and that was how I meant to keep it.</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ready, boys?&#34; Toot asked when we were back in our original formation at the foot of the stairs leading</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">down from my office. I nodded, and we walked to the platform. What we looked like more than</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="593" height="19" font="3">anything, I often thought, was a color-guard that had forgotten its flag.</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;What am I supposed to do?&#34; Percy called from behind the wire mesh between the storage room and the</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="110" height="19" font="3">switch room.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="278" height="19" font="3">&#34;Watch and learn,&#34; I called back.</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">&#34;And keep yer hands off yer wiener,&#34; Harry muttered. Toot-Toot heard him, though, and cackled.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">We escorted him up onto the platform and Toot turned around on his own - the old vet in action. &#34;Sittin</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="627" height="19" font="3">down,&#34; he said, &#34;sittin down. sittin down, takin a seat in Old Sparky's lap.&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I dropped to my right knee before his right leg. Dean dropped to his left knee before his left leg. It was at</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">this point we ourselves would be most vulnerable to physical attack, should the condemned man go</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">berserk, which, every now and then, they did. We both turned the cocked knee slightly inward, to protect</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">the crotch area. We dropped our chins to protect our throats. And, of course, we moved to secure the</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">ankles and neutralize the danger as fast as we could. The Chief would be wearing slippers when he took</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">his final promenade, but &#34;it could have been worse&#34; isn't much comfort to a man with a ruptured larynx.</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Or writhing on the floor with his balls swelling up to the size of Mason jars, for that matter, while forty</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">or so spectators - many of them gentlemen of the press - sit in those Grange-hall chairs, watching the</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="105" height="19" font="3">whole thing.</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">We clamped Toot-Toot's ankles. The clamp on Dean's side was slightly bigger, because it carried the</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">juice. When Bitterbuck sat down tomorrow night, he would do so with a shaved left calf. Indians have</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="511" height="19" font="3">very little body-hair as a rule, but we would take no chances.</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">While we were clamping Toot-Toots ankles, Brutal secured his right wrist. Harry stepped smoothly</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">forward and clamped the left. When they were done, Harry nodded to Brutal, and Brutal called back to</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">Van Hay: &#34;Roll on one!&#34;</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">I heard Percy asking Jack Van Hay what that meant (it was hard to believe how little he knew, how little</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">he'd picked up during his time on E Block) and Van Hay's murmur of explanation. Today Roll on <i>one</i></text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">meant nothing, but when he heard Brutal say it tomorrow night, Van Hay would turn the knob that</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">goosed the prison generator behind B Block. The witnesses would hear the genny as a steady low</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">humming, and the lights all over the prison would brighten. In the other cellblocks, prisoners would</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">observe those overbright lights and think it had happened, the execution was over, when in fact it was</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="125" height="19" font="3">just beginning.</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Brutal stepped around the chair so that Toot could see him. &#34;Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been condemned</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">to die in the electric chair, sentence passed by a jury of your peers and imposed by a judge in good</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">standing in this state. God save the people of this state. Do you have anything to say before sentence is</text>
</page>
<page number="44" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="108" height="19" font="3">carried out?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah,&#34; Toot said, eyes gleaming, lips bunched in a toothless happy grin. &#34;I want a fried chicken dinner</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">with gravy on the taters, I want to shit in your hat, and I got to have Mae West sit on my face, because I</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">am one horny motherfucker.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Brutal tried to hold onto his stem expression, but it was impossible. He threw back his head and began</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">laughing. Dean collapsed onto the edge of the platform like he'd been gutshot, head down between his</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">knees, howling like a coyote, with one hand clapped to his brow as if to keep his brains in there where</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">they belonged. Harry was knocking his own head against the wall and going <i>huh-huh-huh</i> as if he had a</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">glob of food stuck in his throat. Even Jack Van Hay, a man not known for his sense of humor, was</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">laughing. I felt like it myself, of course I did, but controlled it somehow. Tomorrow night it was going to</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="568" height="19" font="3">be for real, and a man would die there where Toot-Toot was sitting.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up, Brutal,&#34; I said. &#34;You too, Dean. Harry and Toot, the next remark like that to come out of your</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="531" height="19" font="3">mouth will be your last. I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real.&#34;</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Toot gave me a grin as if to say that was a good 'un, Boss Edgecombe, a real good 'un. It faltered into a</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="780" height="19" font="3">narrow, puzzled look when he saw I wasn't answering it. &#34;What's wrong witchoo?&#34; he asked.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's not funny,&#34; I said. &#34;That's what's wrong with me, and if you're not smart enough to get it, you better</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">just keep your gob shut.&#34; Except it was funny, in its way, and I suppose that was what had really made</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="72" height="19" font="3">me mad.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="530" height="19" font="3">I looked around, saw Brutal staring at me, still grinning a little.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="393" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shit,&#34; I said, &#34;I'm getting too old for this job.&#34;</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nah,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;You're in your prime, Paul.&#34; But I wasn't, neither was he, not as far as this goddam</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">job went, and both of us knew it. Still, the important thing was that the laughing fit had passed. That was</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">good, because the last thing I wanted was somebody remembering Toot's smart-aleck remark tomorrow</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">night and getting going again. You'd say such a thing would be impossible, a guard laughing his ass off</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">as he escorted a condemned man past the witnesses to the electric chair, but when men are under stress,</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="798" height="19" font="4"><i>anything </i>can happen. And a thing like that, people would have talked about it for twenty years.</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="362" height="19" font="3">&#34;Are you going to be quiet, Toot?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="603" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; he said, his averted face that of the world's oldest, poutiest child.</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">I nodded to Brutal that he should get on with the rehearsal. He took the mask from the brass hook on the</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">back of the chair and rolled it down over Toot Toot's head, pulling it snug under his chin, which opened</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">the hole at the top to its widest diameter. Then Brutal leaned over, picked the wet circle of sponge out of</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">the bucket, pressed one finger against it, then licked the tip of the finger. That done, he put the sponge</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">back in the bucket. Tomorrow he wouldn't. Tomorrow he would tuck it into the cap perched on the back</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="648" height="19" font="3">of the chair. Not today, though; there was no need to get Toot's old head wet.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">The cap was steel, and with the straps dangling down on either side, it looked sort of like a dough boy's</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">helmet. Brutal put it on Old Toot-Toot's head, snugging it down over the hole in the black headcovering.</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Gettin the cap. gettin the cap, gettin the cap,&#34; Toot said, and now his voice sounded squeezed as well as</text>

<page number="45" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">muffled. The straps held his jaw almost closed, and I suspected Brutal had snugged it down a little tighter</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">than he strictly had to for purposes of rehearsal. He stepped back, faced the empty seats, and said: &#34;Arlen</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Bitterbuck, electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are dead, in accordance with state</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="347" height="19" font="3">law. May God have mercy on your soul.&#34;</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="501" height="19" font="3">Brutal turned to the mesh-covered rectangle. &#34;Roll on two.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Old Toot, perhaps trying to recapture his earlier flare of comic genius, began to buck and flail in the</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">chair, as Old Sparky's actual customers almost never did. &#34;Now I'm fryin!&#34; he cried. &#34;Fryin! Fryyyin!</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="287" height="19" font="4"><i>Geeeaah!</i> I'm a done tom turkey!&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">Harry and Dean, I saw, were not watching this at all. They had turned away from Sparky and were</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="775" height="19" font="3">looking across the empty storage room at the door leading back into my office. &#34;Well, I'll be</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="559" height="19" font="3">goddamned,&#34; Harry said. &#34;One of the witnesses came a day early.&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Sitting in the doorway with its tail curled neatly around its paws, watching with its beady black oilspot</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="177" height="19" font="3">eyes, was the mouse.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>5.</b></text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">The execution went well - if there was ever such a thing as &#34;a good one&#34; (a proposition I strongly doubt),</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">then the execution of Arlen Bitterbuck, council elder of the Washita Cherokee, was it. He got his braids</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">wrong - his hands were shaking too badly to make a good job of it - and his eldest daughter, a woman of</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">thirty-odd, was allowed to plait them nice and even. She wanted to weave feathers in at the tips, the</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">pinfeathers of a hawk, his bird, but I couldn't allow it. They might catch fire and burn. I didn't tell her</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">that, of course, just said it was against regulations. She made no protest, only bowed her head and put her</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">hands to her temples to show her disappointment and her disapproval. She conducted herself with great</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="796" height="19" font="3">dignity, that woman, and by doing so practically guaranteed that her father would do the same.</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">The Chief left his cell with no protest or holding back when the time came. Sometimes we had to pry</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">their fingers off the bars - I broke one or two in my time and have never forgotten the muffled snapping</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">sound - but The Chief wasn't one of those, thank God. He walked strong up the Green Mile to my office,</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">and there he dropped to his knees to pray with Brother Schuster, who had driven down from the</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">Heavenly Light Baptist Church in his flivver. Schuster gave The Chief a few psalms, and The Chief</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">started to cry when Schuster got to the one about lying down beside the still waters. It wasn't bad,</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">though, no hysteria, nothing like that. I had an idea he was thinking about still water so pure and so cold</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="542" height="19" font="3">it felt like it was cutting your mouth every time you drank some.</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">Actually, I like to see them cry a little. It's when they don't that I get worried.</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">A lot of men can't get up from their knees again without help, but The Chief did okay in that department.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">He swayed a little at first, like he was lightheaded, and Dean put out a hand to steady him, but Bitterbuck</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="541" height="19" font="3">had already found his balance again on his own, so out we went.</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Almost all the chairs were occupied, with the people in them murmuring quietly among themselves, like</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">folks do when they're waiting for a wedding or a funeral to get started. That was the only time Bitterbuck</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">faltered. I don't know if it was any one person in particular that bothered him, or all of them together, but</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I could hear a low moaning start up in his throat, and all at once the arm I was holding had a drag in it</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">that hadn't been there before. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Harry Terwilliger moving up to cut</text>

<page number="46" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="646" height="19" font="3">off The Chief's retreat if Bitterbuck all at once decided he wanted to go hard.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I tightened my grip on his elbow and tapped the inside of his arm with one finger. &#34;Steady, Chief,&#34; I said</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">out of the corner of my mouth, not moving my lips. &#34;The only thing most of these people will remember</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">about you is how you go out, so give them something good - show them how a Washita does it.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">He glanced at me sideways and gave a little nod. Then he took one of the braids his daughter had made</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">and kissed it. I looked to Brutal, standing at parade rest behind the chair, resplendent in his best blue</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">uniform, all the buttons on the tunic polished and gleaming, his hat sitting square-john perfect on his big</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">head. I gave him a little nod and he shot it right back, stepping forward to help Bitterbuck mount the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="407" height="19" font="3">platform if he needed help. Turned out he didn't.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">It was less than a minute from the time Bitterbuck sat down in the chair to the moment when Brutal</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">,called &#34;Roll on two!&#34; softly back over his shoulder. The lights dimmed down again, but only a little; you</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">wouldn't have noticed it if you hadn't been looking for it. That meant Van Hay had pulled the switch</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">some wit had labeled MABEL'S HAIR DRIER. There was a low humming from the cap, and Bitterbuck</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">surged forward against the clamps and the restraining belt across his chest. Over against the wall, the</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">prison doctor watched expressionlessly, lips thinned until his mouth looked like a single white stitch.</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">There was no flopping and flailing, such as Old Toot-Toot had done at rehearsal, only that powerful</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">forward surge, as a man may surge forward from the hips while in the grip of a powerful orgasm. The</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">Chief's blue shirt pulled tight at the buttons, creating little strained smiles of flesh between them.</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">And there was a smell. Not bad in itself, but unpleasant in its associations. I've never been able to go</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">down in the cellar at my granddaughter's house when they bring me there, although that's where their</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">little boy has his Lionel set-up, which he would dearly love to share with his great-grampa. I don't mind</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">the trains, as I'm sure you can guess - it's the transformer I can't abide. The way it hums. And the way,</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="794" height="19" font="3">when it gets hot, it smells. Even after all these years, that smell reminds me of Cold Mountain.</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Van Hay gave him thirty seconds, then turned the juice off. The doctor stepped forward from his place</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">and listened with his stethoscope. There was no talk from the witnesses now. The doctor straightened up</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">and looked through the mesh. &#34;Disorganized,&#34; he said, and made a twirling, cranking gesture with one</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">finger. He had heard a few random heartbeats from Bitterbuck's chest, probably as meaningless as the</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">final jitters of a decapitated chicken, but it was better not to take chances. You didn't want him suddenly</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">sitting up on the gurney when you had him halfway through the tunnel, bawling that he felt like he was</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">on fire.</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Van Hay rolled on three and The Chief surged forward again, twisting a little from side to side in the grip</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">of the current. When doc listened this time, he nodded. It was over. We had once again succeeded in</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">destroying what we could not create. Some of the folks in the audience had begun talking in those low</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">voices again; most sat with their heads down, looking at the floor, as if stunned. Or ashamed.</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">Harry and Dean came up with the stretcher. It was actually Percy's job to take one end, but he didn't</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">know and no one had bothered to tell him. The Chief, still wearing the black silk hood, was loaded onto</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">it by Brutal and me, and we whisked him through the door which led to the tunnel as fast as we could</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">manage it without actually running. Smoke - too much of it - was rising from the hole in the top of the</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="321" height="19" font="3">mask, and there was a horrible stench.</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="548" height="19" font="3">&#34;Aw, man!&#34; Percy cried, his voice wavering. 'What's that smell?&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="47" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just get out of my way and stay out of it,&#34; Brutal said, shoving past him to get to the wall where there</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">was a mounted fire extinguisher. It was one of the old chemical kind that you had to pump. Dean,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">meanwhile, had stripped off the hood. It wasn't as bad as it could have been; Bitterbuck's left braid was</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="314" height="19" font="3">smouldering like a pile of wet leaves.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;Never mind that thing,&#34; I told Brutal. I didn't want to have to clean a load of chemical slime off the dead</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">man's face before putting him in the back of the meatwagon. I slapped at The Chief's head (Percy staring</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">at me, wide-eyed, the whole time) until the smoke quit rising. Then we carried the body down the twelve</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">wooden steps to the tunnel. Here it was as chilly and dank as a dungeon, with the hollow plink-plink</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="780" height="19" font="3">sound of dripping water. Hanging lights with crude tin shades - they were made in the prison</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">machine-shop - showed a brick tube that ran thirty feet under the highway. The top was curved and wet.</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="675" height="19" font="3">It made me feel like a character in an Edgar Allan Poe story every time I used it.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">There was a gurney waiting. We loaded Bitterbuck's body onto it, and I made a final check to make sure</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">his hair was out. That one braid was pretty well charred, and I was sorry to see that the cunning little bow</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="534" height="19" font="3">on that side of his head was now nothing but a blackened lump.</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Percy slapped the dead man's cheek. The flat smacking sound of his hand made us all jump. Percy looked</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">around at us with a cocky smile on his mouth, eyes glittering. Then he looked back at Bitterbuck again.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="487" height="19" font="3">&#34;Adios, Chief,&#34; he said. &#34;Hope hell's hot enough for you.&#34;</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't do that,&#34; Brutal said, his voice hollow and declamatory in the dripping tunnel. &#34;He's paid what he</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="602" height="19" font="3">owed. He's square with the house again. You keep your hands off him.&#34;</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;Aw, blow it out,&#34; Percy said, but he stepped back uneasily when Brutal moved toward him, shadow</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">rising behind him like the shadow of that ape in the story about the Rue Morgue. But instead of grabbing</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">at Percy, Brutal grabbed hold of the gurney and began pushing Arlen Bitterbuck slowly toward the far</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">end of the tunnel, where his last ride was waiting, parked on the soft shoulder of the highway. The</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">gurney's hard rubber wheels moaned on the boards; its shadow rode the bulging brick wall, waxing and</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">waning; Dean and Harry grasped the sheet at the foot and pulled it up over The Chief's face, which had</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">already begun to take on the waxy, characterless cast of all dead faces, the innocent as well as the guilty.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>6.</b></text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">When I was eighteen, my Uncle Paul - the man I was named for - died of a heart attack. My mother and</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">dad took me to Chicago with them to attend his funeral and visit relatives from my father's side of the</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">family, many of whom I had never met. We were gone almost a month. In some ways that was a good</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">trip, a necessary and exciting trip, but in another way it was horrible. I was deeply in love, you see, with</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the young woman who was to become my wife two weeks after my nineteenth birthday. One night when</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">my longing for her was like a fire burning out of control in my heart and my head (oh yes, all right, and</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">in my balls, as well), I wrote her a letter that just seemed to go on and on - I poured out my whole heart</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">in it, never looking back to see what I'd said because I was afraid cowardice would make me stop. I didn't</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">stop, and when a voice in my head clamored that it would be madness to mail such a letter, that I would</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">be giving her my naked heart to hold in her hand, I ignored it with a child's breathless disregard of the</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">consequences. I often wondered if Janice kept that letter, but never quite got up enough courage to ask.</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">All I know for sure is that I did not find it when I went through her things after the funeral, and of course</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">that by itself means nothing. I suppose I never asked because I was afraid of discovering that burning</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">epistle meant less to her than it did to me.</text>

<text top="38" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">It was four pages long, I thought I would never write anything longer in my life, and now look at this. All</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">this, and the end still not in sight. If I'd known the story was going to go on this long, I might never have</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">started. What I didn't realize was how many doors the act of writing unlocks, as if my Dad's old fountain</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">pen wasn't really a pen at all, but some strange variety of skeleton key. The mouse is probably the best</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">example of what I'm talking about - Steamboat Willy, Mr. Jingles, the mouse on the Mile. Until I started</text>
<text top="158" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">to write, I never realized how important he (yes, <i>he)</i> was. The way he seemed to be looking for Delacroix</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">before Delacroix arrived, for instance - I don't think that ever occurred to me, not to my conscious mind,</text>
<text top="206" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">anyway, until I began to write and remember.</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">I guess what I'm saying is that I didn't realize how far back I'd have to go in order to tell you about John</text>
<text top="269" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Coffey, or how long I'd have to leave him there in his cell, a man so huge his feet didn't just stick off the</text>
<text top="293" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">end of his bunk but hung down all the way to the floor. I don't want you to forget him, all right? I want</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">you to see him there, looking up at the ceiling of his cell, weeping his silent tears, or putting his arms</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">over his face. I want you to hear him, his sighs that trembled like sobs, his occasional watery groan.</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">These weren't the sounds of agony and regret we sometimes heard on E Block, sharp cries with splinters</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">of remorse in them; like his wet eyes, they were somehow removed from the pain we were used to</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">dealing with. In a way - I know how crazy this will sound, of course I do, but there is no sense in writing</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">something as long as this if you can't say what feels true to your heart - in a way it was as if it was sorrow</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">for the whole world he felt, something too big ever to be completely eased. Sometimes I sat and talked to</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">him, as I did with all of them - talking was our biggest, most important job, as I believe I have said - and</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">I tried to comfort him. I don't feel that I ever did, and part of my heart was glad he was suffering, you</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">know. Felt he <i>deserved</i> to suffer. I even thought sometimes of calling the governor (or getting Percy to</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">do it - hell, he was Percy's damn uncle, not mine) and asking for a stay of execution. <i>We shouldn't burn</i></text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="4"><i>him yet,</i> I'd say <i>It's still hurting him too much, biting into him too much, twisting in his guts like a nice</i></text>

<text top="668" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">It's that John Coffey I'd have you keep to one side of your mind while I finish catching up to where I</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">started - that John Coffey lying on his bunk, that John Coffey who was afraid of the dark perhaps with</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">good reason, for in the dark might not two shapes with blonde curls - no longer little girls but avenging</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">harpies - be waiting for him? That John Coffey whose eyes were always streaming tears, like blood from</text>

<text top="866" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">Cold Mountain's hundred and fifty lifers. Life for The Pres turned out to be twelve years. He was</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">drowned in the prison laundry in 1944. Not the Cold Mountain prison laundry; Cold Mountain closed in</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">1933. I don't suppose it mattered much to the inmates - wars is walls, as the cons say, and Old Sparky</text>

<text top="1025" left="15" width="787" height="19" font="3">the guards pulled him out again, his face was almost entirely gone. They had to ID him by his</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">fingerprints. On the whole, he might have been better off with Old Sparky ... but then he never would</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">have had those extra twelve years, would he? I doubt he thought much about them, though, in the last</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">minute or so of his life, when his lungs were trying to learn how to breathe Hexlite and lye cleanser.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">They never caught whoever did for him. By then I was out of the corrections line of work, but Harry</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Terwilliger wrote and told me. &#34;He got commuted mostly because he was white,&#34; Harry wrote, &#34;but he</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">got it in the end, just the same. I just think of it as a long stay of execution that finally ran out.&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">There was a quiet time for us in E Block, once The Pres was gone. Harry and Dean were temporarily</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">reassigned, and it was just me, Brutal, and Percy on the Green Mile for a little bit. Which actually meant</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">just me and Brutal, because Percy kept pretty much to himself. I tell you, that young man was a genius at</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">finding things not to do. And every so often (but only when Percy wasn't around), the other guys would</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">show up to have what Harry liked to call &#34;a good gab.&#34; On many of these occasions the mouse would</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">also show up. We'd feed him and he'd sit there eating, just as solemn as Solomon, watching us with his</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="204" height="19" font="3">bright little oilspot eyes.</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">That was a good few weeks, calm and easy even with Percy's more than occasional carping. But all good</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">things come to an end, and on a rainy Monday in late July - have I told you how rainy and dank that</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">summer was? - I found myself sitting on the bunk of an open cell and waiting for Eduard Delacroix.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">He came with an unexpected bang. The door leading into the exercise yard slammed open, letting in a</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">flood of light, there was a confused rattle of chains, a frightened voice babbling away in a mixture of</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">English and Cajun French (a patois the cons at Cold Mountain used to call da bayou), and Brutal</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="474" height="19" font="3">hollering, &#34;Hey! Quit it! For Chrissakes! Quit it, Percy!&#34;</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">I had been half-dozing on what was to become Delacroix's bunk, but I was up in a hurry, my heart</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">slugging away hard in my chest. Noise of that kind on E Block almost never happened until Percy came;</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">he brought it along with him like a bad smell.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, you fuckin French-fried faggot!&#34; Percy yelled, ignoring Brutal completely. And here he came,</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">dragging a guy not much bigger than a bowling pin by one arm. In his other hand, Percy had his baton.</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">His teeth were bared in a strained grimace, and his face was bright red. Yet he did not look entirely</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">unhappy. Delacroix was trying to keep up with him, but he had the legirons on, and no matter how fast</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">he shuffled his feet, Percy pulled him along faster. I sprang out of the cell just in time to catch him as he</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">fell, and that was how Del and I were introduced.</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Percy rounded on him, baton raised, and I held him back with one arm. Brutal came puffing up to us,</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="458" height="19" font="3">looking as shocked and nonplussed by all this as I felt.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="744" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't let him hit me no mo, m'sieu,&#34; Delacroix babbled. &#34;S'il vous plait, s'il vous plait!&#34;</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let me at im, let me at im!&#34; Percy cried, lunging forward. He began to hit at Delacroix's shoulders with</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">his baton. Delacroix held his arms up, screaming, and the stick went whap-whap-whap against the</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">sleeves of his blue prison shirt. I saw him that night with the shirt off, and that boy had bruises from</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Christmas to Easter. Seeing them made me feel bad. He was a murderer, and nobody's darling, but that's</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="587" height="19" font="3">not the way we did things on E Block. Not until Percy came, anyhow.</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">&#34;Whoa! Whoa!&#34; I roared. &#34;Quit that! What's it all about, anyway?&#34; I was trying to get my body in</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">between Delacroix's and Percy's, but it wasn't working very well. Percy's club continued to flail away,</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">now on one side of me and now on the other. Sooner or later he was going to bring one down on me</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">instead of on his intended target, and then there was going to be a brawl right here in this corridor, no</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">matter who his relations were. I wouldn't be able to help myself, and Brutal was apt to join in. In some</text>
</page>
<page number="50" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">ways, you know, I wish we'd done it. It might have changed some of the things that happened later on.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="708" height="19" font="3">&#34;Fucking faggot! I'll teach you to keep your hands off me, you lousy bum-puncher!&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Whap! Whap! Whap! And now Delacroix was bleeding from one ear and screaming. I gave up trying to</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">shield him, grabbed him by one shoulder, and hurled him into his cell, where he went sprawling on the</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">bunk. Percy darted around me and gave him a final hard whap on the butt - one to go on, you could say.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="809" height="19" font="3">Then Brutal grabbed him - Percy - I mean - by the shoulders and hauled him across the corridor.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">I grabbed the cell door and ran it shut on its tracks. Then I turned to Percy, my shock and bewilderment</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">at war with pure fury. Percy had been around about several months at that point, long enough for all of us</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">to decide we didn't like him very much, but that was the first time I fully understood how out of control</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="63" height="19" font="3">he was.</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">He stood watching me, not entirely without fear - he was a coward at heart, I never had any doubt of that</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">- but still confident that his connections would protect him. In that he was correct. I suspect there are</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">people who wouldn't understand why that was, even after all I've said, but they would be people who</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">only know the phrase Great Depression from the history books. If you were there, it was a lot more than</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="772" height="19" font="3">a phrase in a book, and if you had a steady job, brother, you'd do almost anything to keep it.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">The color was fading out of Percy's face a little by then, but his cheeks were still flushed, and his hair,</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="784" height="19" font="3">which was usually swept back and gleaming with brilliantine, had tumbled over his forehead.</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;What in the Christ was that all about?&#34; I asked. &#34;I have never - I have never! - had a prisoner beaten</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="196" height="19" font="3">onto my block before!&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Little fag bastard tried to cop my joint when I pulled him out of the van,&#34; Percy said. &#34;He had it coming,</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="165" height="19" font="3">and I'd do it again.&#34;</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">I looked at him, too flabbergasted for words. I couldn't imagine the most predatory homosexual on God's</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">green earth doing what Percy had just described. Preparing to move into a crossbar apartment on the</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="710" height="19" font="3">Green Mile did not, as a rule, put even the most deviant of prisoners in a sexy mood.</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">I looked back at Delacroix, cowering on his bunk with his arms still up to protect his face. There were</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">cuffs on his wrists and a chain running between his ankles. Then I turned to Percy &#34;Get out of here,&#34; I</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="294" height="19" font="3">said. &#34;I'll want to talk to you later.&#34;</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is this going to be in your report?&#34; he demanded truculently. &#34;Because if it is, I can make a report of my</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="144" height="19" font="3">own, you know.&#34;</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="668" height="19" font="3">I didn't want to make a report; I only wanted him out of my sight. I told him so.</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;The matter's closed,&#34; I finished. I saw Brutal looking at me disapprovingly, but ignored it. &#34;Go on, get</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">out of here. Go over to Admin and tell them you're supposed to read letters and help in the package</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="58" height="19" font="3">room.&#34;</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure.&#34; He had his composure back, or the crackheaded arrogance that served him as composure. He</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">brushed his hair back from his forehead with his hands - soft and white and small, the hands of a girl in</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">her early teens, you would have thought - and then approached the cell. Delacroix saw him, and he</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">cringed back even farther on his bunk, gibbering in a mixture of English and stewpot French.</text>
</page>
<page number="51" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;I ain't done with you, Pierre,&#34; he said, then jumped as one of Brutal's huge hands fell on his shoulder.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="501" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes you are,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Now go on. Get in the breeze!&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;You don't scare me, you know,&#34; Percy said. &#34;Not a bit!&#34; His eyes shifted to me. &#34;Either of you.&#34; But we</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">did. You could see that in his eyes as clear as day, and it made him even more dangerous. A guy like</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">Percy doesn't even know himself what he means to do from minute to minute and second to second.</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">What he did right then was turn away from us and go walking up the corridor in long, arrogant strides.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">He had shown the world what happened when scrawny, half-bald little Frenchmen tried to cop his joint,</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="382" height="19" font="3">by God, and he was leaving the field a victor.</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">I went through my set speech, all about how we had the radio - Make Believe Ballroom and Our Gal</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Sunday, and how we'd treat him jake if he did the same for us. That little homily was not what you'd call</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">one of my great successes. He cried all the way through it, sitting huddled up at the foot of his bunk, as</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">far from me as he could get without actually fading into the corner. He cringed every time I moved, and I</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">don't think he heard one word in six. Probably just as well. I don't think that particular homily made a</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="233" height="19" font="3">whole lot of sense, anyway.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">Fifteen minutes later I was back at the desk, where a shaken-looking Brutus Howell was sitting and</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">licking the tip of the pencil we kept with the visitors' book. &#34;Will you stop that before you poison</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="288" height="19" font="3">yourself, for God's sake?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ almighty Jesus,&#34; he said, putting the pencil down. &#34;I never want to have another hooraw like that</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="317" height="19" font="3">with a prisoner coming on the block.&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">&#34;My Daddy always used to say things come in threes,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, I hope your Daddy was full of shit on that subject,&#34; Brutal said, but of course he wasn't. There was</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">a squall when John Coffey came in, and a fullblown storm when &#34;Wild Bill&#34; joined us - it's funny, but</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">things really do seem to come in threes. The story of our introduction to Wild Bill, how he came onto the</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="633" height="19" font="3">Mile trying to commit murder, is something I'll get to shortly; fair warning.</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="476" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's this about Delacroix copping his joint?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Brutal snorted. &#34;He was ankle-chained and ole Percy was just pulling him too fast, that's all. He stumbled</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">and started to fall as he got out of the stagecoach. He put his hands out same as anyone would when they</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="772" height="19" font="3">start to fall, and one of them brushed the front of Percy's pants. It was a complete accident!&#34;</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Did Percy know that, do you think?&#34; I asked. &#34;Was he maybe using it as an excuse just because he felt</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">like whaling on Delacroix a little bit? Showing him who bosses the shooting match around here?&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="495" height="19" font="3">Brutal nodded slowly. &#34;Yeah. I think that was probably it.&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">&#34;We have to watch him, then,&#34; I said, and ran my hands, through my hair. As if the job wasn't hard</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="319" height="19" font="3">enough. &#34;God, I hate this. I hate <i>him.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;Me, too. And you want to know something else, Paul? I don't understand him. He's got connections, I</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">understand <i>that,</i> all right, but why would he use them to get a job on the Green fucking Mile? <i>Anywhere</i></text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">in the state pen, for that matter? Why not as a page in the state senate, or the guy who makes the</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">lieutenant governor's appointments? Surely his people could've gotten him something better if he'd asked</text>
</page>
<page number="52" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="174" height="19" font="3">them, so why <i>here?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I shook my head. I didn't know. There were a lot of things I didn't know then. I suppose I was naive.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>8.</b></text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">After that, things went back to normal again ... for awhile, at least. Down in the county seat, the state was</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">preparing to bring John Coffey to trial, and Trapingus County Sheriff Homer Cribus was pooh-poohing</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the idea that a lynch-mob might hurry justice along a little bit. None of that mattered to us; on E Block,</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">no one paid much attention to the news. Life on the Green Mile was, in a way, like life in a soundproof</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">room. From time to time you heard mutterings that were probably explosions in the outside world, but</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">that was about all. They wouldn't hurry with John Coffey; they'd want to make damned sure of him.</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">On a couple of occasions Percy got to ragging Delacroix, and the second time I pulled him aside and told</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">him to come up to my office. It wasn't my first interview with Percy on the subject of his behavior, and it</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">wouldn't be the last, but it was prompted by what, was probably the clearest understanding of what he</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">was. He had the heart of a cruel boy who goes to the zoo not so he can study the animals but so he can</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="297" height="19" font="3">throw stones at them in their cages.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;You stay away from him, now, you hear?&#34; I said. &#34;Unless I give you a specific order, just stay the hell</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="142" height="19" font="3">away from him.&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Percy combed his hair back, then patted at it with his sweet little hands. That boy just loved touching his</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">hair. &#34;I wasn't doing nothing to him,&#34; he said. &#34;Only asking how it felt to know you had burned up some</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="496" height="19" font="3">babies, is all.&#34; Percy gave me a round-eyed, innocent stare.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="398" height="19" font="3">&#34;You quit with it, or there'll be a report,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">He laughed. &#34;Make any report you want,&#34; he said. &#34;Then I'll turn around and make my own. Just like I</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="517" height="19" font="3">told you when he came in. We'll see who comes off the best.&#34;</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">I leaned forward, hands folded on my desk, and spoke in a tone I hoped would sound like a friend being</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">confidential. &#34;Brutus Howell doesn't like you much,&#34; I said. &#34;And when Brutal doesn't like someone, he's</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">been known to make his own report. He isn't much shakes with a pen, and he can't quit from licking that</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="574" height="19" font="3">pencil, so he's apt to report with his fists. If you know what I mean.&#34;</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="577" height="19" font="3">Percy's complacent little smile faltered. &#34;What are you trying to say&#34;</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm not trying to say anything. I <i>have</i> said it. And if you tell any of your ...friends ... about this</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">discussion, I'll say you made the whole thing up.&#34; I looked at him all wide-eyed and earnest. &#34;Besides,</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">I'm trying to be your friend, Percy. A word to the wise is sufficient, they say. And why would you want</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="542" height="19" font="3">to get into it with Delacroix in the first place? He's not worth it.&#34;</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">And for awhile that worked. There was peace. A couple of times I was even able to send Percy with</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Dean or Harry when Delacroix's time to shower had rolled around. We had the radio at night, Delacroix</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="640" height="19" font="3">began to relax a little into the scant routine of E Block, and there was peace.</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="324" height="19" font="3">Then, one night, I heard him laughing.</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger was on the desk, and soon he was laughing, too. I got up and went on down to</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="497" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's cell to see what he possibly had to laugh about.</text>

<page number="53" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="568" height="19" font="3">&#34;Look, Cap'n&#34; he said when he saw me. &#34;I done tame me a mouse!&#34;</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">It was Steamboat Willy. He was in Delacroix's cell. More: he was sitting on Delacroix's shoulder and</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">looking calmly out through the bars at us with his little oildrop eyes. His tail was curled around his paws,</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">and he looked completely at peace. As for Delacroix - friend, you wouldn't have known it was the same</text>
<text top="158" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">man who'd sat cringing and shuddering at the foot of his bunk not a week before. He looked like my</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="787" height="19" font="3">daughter used to on Christmas morning, when she came down the stairs and saw the presents.</text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;Watch dis!&#34; Delacroix said. The mouse was sitting on his right shoulder. Delacroix stretched out his left</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">arm. The mouse scampered up to the top of Delacroix's head, using the man's hair (which was thick</text>
<text top="269" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">enough in back, at least) to climb up. Then he scampered down the other side, Delacroix giggling as his</text>
<text top="293" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">tail tickled the side of his neck. The mouse ran all the way down his arm to his wrist, then turned,</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="740" height="19" font="3">scampered back up to Delacroix's left shoulder, and curled his tail around his feet again.</text>
<text top="356" left="15" width="240" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll be damned,&#34; Harry said.</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;I train him to do that,&#34; Delacroix said proudly. I thought, In a pig's ass you did, but kept my mouth shut.</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="221" height="19" font="3">&#34;His name is Mr. Jingles.&#34;</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nah,&#34; Harry said goodnaturedly. &#34;It's Steamboat Willy, like in the pitcher-show. Boss Howell named</text>
<text top="482" left="15" width="46" height="19" font="3">him.&#34;</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's Mr. Jingles,&#34; Delacroix said. On any other subject he would have told you that shit was Shinola, if</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">you wanted him to, but on the subject of the mouse's name he was perfectly adamant. &#34;He whisper it in</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">my ear. Cap'n, can I have a box for him? Can I have a box for my mous', so he can sleep in here wit me?&#34;</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">His voice began to fall into wheedling tones I had heard a thousand times before. &#34;I put him under my</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="414" height="19" font="3">bunk and he never be a scrid of trouble, not one.&#34;</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="771" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your English gets a hell of a lot better when you want something,&#34; I said, stalling for time.</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="531" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh-oh,&#34; Harry murmured, nudging me. &#34;Here comes trouble.&#34;</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">But Percy didn't look like trouble to me, not that night. He wasn't running his hands through his hair or</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">fiddling with that baton of his, and the top button of his uniform shirt was actually undone. It was the</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">first time I'd seen him that way, and it was amazing, what a change a little thing like that could make.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Mostly, though, what struck me was the expression on his face. There was a calmness there. Not serenity</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">- I don't think Percy Wetmore had a serene bone in his body - but the look of a man who has discovered</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">he can wait for the things he wants. It was quite a change from the young man I'd had to threaten with</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="377" height="19" font="3">Brutus Howell's fists only a few days before.</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Delacroix didn't see the change, though; he cringed against the wall of his cell, drawing his knees up to</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">his chest. His eyes seemed to grow until they were taking up half his face. The mouse scampered up on</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">his bald pate and sat there. I don't know if he remembered that he also had reason to distrust Percy, but it</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">certainly looked as if he did. Probably it was just smelling the little Frenchman's fear, and reacting off</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="37" height="19" font="3">that.</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="619" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, well,&#34; Percy said. &#34;Looks like you found yourself a friend, Eddie.&#34;</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Delacroix tried to reply-some hollow defiance about what would happen to Percy if Percy hurt his new</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">pal would have been my guess - but nothing came out. His lower lip trembled a little, but that was all. On</text>
</page>
<page number="54" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">top of his head, Mr. Jingles wasn't trembling. He sat perfectly still with his back feet in Delacroix's hair</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">and his front ones splayed on Delacroix's bald looking at Percy, seeming to size him up. The way you'd</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="183" height="19" font="3">size up an old enemy.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">Percy looked at me. &#34;Isn't that the same one I chased? The one that lives in the restraint room?&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">I nodded. I had an idea Percy hadn't seen the newly named Mr. Jingles since that last chase, and he</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="372" height="19" font="3">showed no signs of wanting to chase it now.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, that's the one,&#34; I said. &#34;Only Delacroix there says his name is Mr. Jingles, not Steamboat Willy.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="335" height="19" font="3">Says the mouse whispered it in his ear.&#34;</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is that so,&#34; Percy said. &#34;Wonders never cease, do they?&#34; I half-expected him to pull out his baton and</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">start tapping it against the bars, just to show Delacroix who was boss, but he only stood there with his</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="247" height="19" font="3">hands on his hips, looking in.</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">And for no reason I could have told you in words, I said: &#34;Delacroix there was just asking for a box,</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Percy. He thinks that mouse will sleep in it, I guess. That he can keep it for a pet.&#34; I loaded my voice</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">with skepticism, and sensed more than saw Harry looking at me in surprise. &#34;What do you think about</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="49" height="19" font="3">that?&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think it'll probably shit up his nose some night while he's sleeping and then run away,&#34; Percy said</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">evenly, &#34;but I guess that's the French boy's lookout. I seen a pretty nice cigar box on Toot-Toot's cart the</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">other night. I don't know if he'd give it away, though. Probably want a nickel for it, maybe even a dime.&#34;</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Now I did risk a glance at Harry, and saw his mouth hanging open. This wasn't quite like the change in</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning, after the ghosts had had their way with him, but it was damned</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="48" height="19" font="3">close.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Percy leaned closer to Delacroix, putting his face between the bars. Delacroix shrank back even farther. I</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="603" height="19" font="3">swear to God that he would have melted into that wall if he'd been able.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">&#34;You got a nickel or maybe as much as a dime to pay for a cigar box, you lugoon?&#34; he asked.</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="750" height="19" font="3">&#34;I got four pennies,&#34;, Delacroix said. &#34;I give them for a box, if it a good one, s'il est <i>bon.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll tell you what,&#34; Percy said. &#34;If that toothless old whoremaster will sell you that Corona box for four</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">cents, I'll sneak some cotton batting out of the dispensary to line it with. We'll make us a regular Mousie</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Hilton, before we're through.&#34; He shifted his eyes to me. &#34;I'm supposed to write a switch-room report</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="579" height="19" font="3">about Bitterbuck,&#34; he said. &#34;Is there some pens in your office, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, indeed,&#34; I said. &#34;Forms, too. Lefthand top drawer.&#34;</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="447" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, that's aces,&#34; he said, and went swaggering off.</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Harry and I looked at each other. &#34;Is he sick, do you think?&#34; Harry asked. &#34;Maybe went to his doctor and</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">found out he's only got three months to live?&#34;</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">I told him I didn't have the slightest idea what was up. It was the truth then, and for awhile after, but I</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">found out in time. And a few years later, I had an interesting supper-table conversation with Hal Moores.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">By then we could talk freely, what with him being retired and me being at the Boys' Correctional. It was</text>
</page>
<page number="55" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">one of those meals where you drink too much and eat too little, and tongues get loosened. Hal told me</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">that Percy had been in to complain about me and about life on the Mile in general. This was just after</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Delacroix came on the block, and Brutal and I had kept Percy from beating him half to death. What had</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">griped Percy the most was me telling him to get out of my sight. He didn't think a man who was related</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="472" height="19" font="3">to the governor should have to put up with talk like that.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Well, Moores told me, he had stood Percy off for as long as he could, and when it became dear to him</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">that Percy was going to try pulling some strings to get me reprimanded and moved to another part of the</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">prison at the very least, he, Moores, had pulled Percy into his office and told him that if he quit rocking</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">the boat, Moores would make sure that Percy was out front for Delacroix's execution. That he would, in</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">fact, be placed right beside the chair. I would be in charge, as always, but the witnesses wouldn't know</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">that; to them it would look as if Mr. Percy Wetmore was boss of the cotillion. Moores wasn't promising</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">any more than what we'd already discussed and I'd gone along with, but Percy didn't know that. He</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">agreed to leave off his threats to have me reassigned, and the atmosphere on E Block sweetened. He had</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">even agreed that Delacroix could keep Percy's old nemesis as a pet. It's amazing how some men can</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">change, given the right incentive; in Percy's case, all Warden Moores had to offer was the chance to take</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="245" height="19" font="3">a bald little Frenchman's life.</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>9.</b></text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Toot-Toot felt that four cents was far too little for a prime Corona cigar box, and in that he was probably</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">right - cigar boxes were highly prized objects in prison. A thousand different small items could be stored</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">in them, the smell was pleasant, and there was something about them that reminded our customers of</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">what it was like to be free men. Because cigarettes were permitted in prison but cigars were not, I</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="73" height="19" font="3">imagine.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Dean Stanton, who was back on the block by then, added a penny to the pot, and I kicked one in, as well.</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">When Toot still proved reluctant, Brutal went to work on him, first telling him he ought to be ashamed of</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">himself for behaving like such a cheapskate, then promising him that he, Brutus Howell, would</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">personally put that Corona box back in Toot's hands the day after Delacroix's execution. &#34;Six cents might</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">or might not be enough if you was speaking about <i>selling </i>that cigar box, we could have a good old</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">barber-shop argument about that,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;but you have to admit it's a great price for <i>renting</i> one.</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">He's gonna walk the Mile in a month, six weeks at the very outside. Why, that box'll be back on the shelf</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">under your cart almost before you know it's gone.&#34;</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;He could get a soft-hearted judge to give im a stay and still be here to sing 'Should old acquaintances be</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">forgot,'&#34; Toot said, but he knew better and Brutal knew he did. Old Toot-Toot had been pushing that</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">damned Bible-quoting cart of his around Cold Mountain since Pony Express days, practically, and he had</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">plenty of sources, better than ours, I thought then. He knew Delacroix was fresh out of soft-hearted</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">judges. All he had left to hope for was the governor, who as a rule didn't issue clemency to folks who had</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="321" height="19" font="3">baked half a dozen of his constituents.</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="759" height="19" font="3">&#34;Even if he don't get a stay, that mouse'd be shitting in that box until October, maybe even</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Thanksgiving,&#34; Toot argued, but Brutal could see he was weakening. &#34;Who gonna buy a cigar box some</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="261" height="19" font="3">mouse been using for a toilet?&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh jeez-Louise,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;That's the numbest thing I've ever heard you say, Toot. I mean, that takes</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">the cake. First, Delacroix will keep the box clean enough to eat a church dinner out of - the way he loves</text>
</page>
<page number="56" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">that mouse, he'd lick it clean if that's what it took.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="419" height="19" font="3">&#34;Easy on dat stuff,&#34; Toot said, wrinkling his nose.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">&#34;Second,&#34; Brutal went on, &#34;mouse-shit is no big deal, anyway. It's just hard little pellets, looks like</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="358" height="19" font="3">birdshot. Shake it right out. Nothing to it!&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">Old Toot knew better than to carry his protest any further; he'd been on the yard long enough to</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">understand when he could afford to face into the breeze and when he'd do better to bend in the hurricane.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">This wasn't exactly a hurricane, but we bluesuits liked the mouse, and we liked the idea of Delacroix</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">having the mouse, and that meant it was at least a gale. So Delacroix got his box, and Percy was as good</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">as his word - two days later the bottom was lined with soft pads of cotton batting from the dispensary.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Percy handed them over himself, and I could see the fear in Delacroix's eyes as he reached out through</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the bars to take them. He was afraid Percy would grab his hand and break his fingers. I was a little afraid</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">of it too, but no such thing happened. That was the closest I ever came to liking Percy, but even then it</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">was hard to mistake the look of cool amusement in his eyes. Delacroix had a pet; Percy had one too.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">Delacroix would keep his, petting it and loving it as long as he could; Percy would wait patiently (as</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="563" height="19" font="3">patiently as a man like him could anyway), and then burn his alive.</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mousie Hilton, open for business.&#34; Harry said. &#34;The only question is, will the little bugger use it?&#34;</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">That question was answered as soon as Delacroix caught Mr. Jingles up in one hand and lowered him</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">gently into the box. The mouse snuggled into the white cotton as if it were Aunt Bea's comforter, and that</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="758" height="19" font="3">was his home from then until ... well, I'll get to the end of Mr. Jingles's story in good time.</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="790" height="19" font="3">Old Toot-Toots worries that the cigar box would, fill up with mouse-shit proved to be entirely</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">groundless. I never saw a single turd in there, and Delacroix said he never did, either, anywhere in his</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">cell, for that matter. Much later, around the time Brutal showed me the hole in the beam and we found</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">the colored splinters, I moved a chair out of the restraint room's east corner and found a little pile of</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">mouse turds back there. He had always gone back to the same place to do his business, seemingly, and as</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">far from us as he could get. Here's another thing: I never saw him peeing, and usually mice can hardly</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">turn the faucet off for two minutes at a time, especially while they're eating. I told you, the damned thing</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="235" height="19" font="3">was one of God's mysteries.</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">A week or so after Mr. Jingles had settled into the cigar box, Delacroix called me and Brutal down to his</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">cell to see something. He did that so much it was annoying - if Mr. Jingles so much as rolled over on his</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">back with his paws in the air, it was the cutest thing on God's earth, as far as that half-pint Cajun was</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="598" height="19" font="3">concerned - but this time what he was up to really was sort of amusing.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Delacroix had been pretty much forgotten by the world following his conviction, but he had one relation</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">- an old maiden aunt, I believe - who wrote him once a week. She had also sent him an enormous bag of</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">peppermint candies, the sort which are marketed under the name Canada Mints these days. They looked</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="804" height="19" font="3">like big pink pills. Delacroix was not allowed to have the whole bag at once, naturally - it was a</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">five-pounder, and he would have gobbled them until he had to go to the infirmary with stomach-gripes.</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Like almost every murderer we ever had on the Mile, he had absolutely no understanding of moderation.</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="747" height="19" font="3">We'd give them out to him half a dozen at a time, and only then if he remembered to ask.</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles was sitting beside Delacroix on the bunk when we got down there, holding one of those pink</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">candies in his paws and munching contentedly away at it. Delacroix was simply overcome with delight -</text>
</page>
<page number="57" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">he was like a classical pianist watching his five-year-old son play his first halting exercises. But don't get</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">me wrong; it was funny, a real hoot. The candy was half the size of Mr. Jingles, and his whitefurred belly</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="254" height="19" font="3">was already distended from it.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Take it away from him, Eddie,&#34; Brutal said, half-laughing and half-horrified. &#34;Christ almighty Jesus,</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">he'll eat till he busts. I can smell that peppermint from here. How many have you let him have?&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;This his second,&#34; Delacroix said, looking a little nervously at Mr. Jingles's belly. &#34;You really think he ...</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="231" height="19" font="3">you know ... bus' his guts?&#34;</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="176" height="19" font="3">&#34;Might,&#34; Brutal said.</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">That was enough authority for Delacroix. He reached for the half-eaten pink mint. I expected the mouse</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">to nip him, but Mr. Jingles gave over that mint - what remained of it, anyway - as meek as could be. I</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">looked at Brutal, and Brutal gave his head a little shake as if to say no, he didn't understand it, either.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Then Mr. Jingles plopped down into his box and lay there on his side in an exhausted way that made all</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">three of us laugh. After that, we got used to seeing the mouse sitting beside Delacroix, holding a mint and</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">munching away on it just as neatly as an old lady at an afternoon tea-party, both of them surrounded by</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">what I later smelled in that hole in the beam - the half-bitter, half-sweet smell of peppermint candy.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">There's one more thing to tell you about Mr. Jingles before moving on to the arrival of William Wharton,</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">which was when the cyclone really touched down on E Block. A week or so after the incident of the</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">peppermint candies - around the time when we'd pretty much decided Delacroix wasn't going to feed his</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">pet to death, in other words - the Frenchman called me down to his cell. I was on my own for the time</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">being, Brutal over at the commissary for something, and according to the regs, I was not supposed to</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">approach a prisoner in such circumstances. But since I probably could have shot-putted Delacroix twenty</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="713" height="19" font="3">yards one-handed on a good day, I decided to break the rule and see what he wanted.</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;Watch this, Boss Edgecombe,&#34; he said. &#34;You gonna see what Mr. Jingles can do!&#34; He reached behind</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="435" height="19" font="3">the cigar box and brought up a small wooden spool.</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where'd you get that?&#34; I asked him, although I supposed I knew. There was really only one person he</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="218" height="19" font="3">could have gotten it from.</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="328" height="19" font="3">&#34;Old Toot-Toot,&#34; he said. 'Watch this.&#34;</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">I was already watching, and could see Mr. Jingles in his box, standing up with his small front paws</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">propped on the edge, his black eyes fixed on the spool Delacroix was holding between the thumb and</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">first finger of his right hand. I felt a funny little chill go up my back. I had never seen a mere mouse</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">attend to something with such sharpness - with such <i>intelligence.</i> I don't really believe that Mr. Jingles</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">was a supernatural visitation, and if I have given you that idea, I'm sorry, but I have never doubted that</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="233" height="19" font="3">he was a genius of his kind.</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Delacroix bent over and rolled the threadless spool across the floor of his cell. It went easily, like a pair</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">of wheels connected by an axle. The mouse was out of his box in a flash and across the floor after it, like</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="646" height="19" font="3">a dog chasing after a stick. I exclaimed with surprise, and Delacroix grinned.</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">The spool hit the wall and rebounded. Mr. Jingles went around it and pushed it back to the bunk,</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">switching from one end of the spool to the other whenever it looked like it was going to veer offcourse.</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">He pushed the spool until it hit Delacroix's foot. Then he looked up at him for a moment, as if to make</text>
</page>
<page number="58" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">sure Delacroix had no more immediate tasks for him (a few arithmetic problems to solve, perhaps, or</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">some Latin to parse). Apparently satisfied on this score, Mr. Jingles went back to the cigar box and</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="201" height="19" font="3">settled down in it again.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">&#34;You taught him that,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yessir, Boss Edgecombe,&#34; Delacroix said, his smile only slightly dissembling. &#34;He fetch it every time.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="198" height="19" font="3">Smart as hell, ain't he?&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="641" height="19" font="3">&#34;And the spool?&#34; I asked. &#34;How did you know to fetch that for him, Eddie?&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">&#34;He whisper in my ear that he want it,&#34; Delacroix said serenely. &#34;Same as he whisper his name.&#34;</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Delacroix showed all the other guys his mouse's trick ... all except Percy. To Delacroix, it didn't matter</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">that Percy had suggested the cigar box and procured the cotton with which to line it. Delacroix was like</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">some dogs: kick them once and they never trust you again, no matter how nice you are to them.</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">I can hear Delacroix now, yelling, <i>Hey, you guys! Come and see what Mr. Jingles can do!</i> And them</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">going down in a bluesuit cluster - Brutal, Harry, Dean, even Bill Dodge. All of them had been properly</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="307" height="19" font="3">amazed, too, the same as I had been.</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Three or four days after Mr. Jingles started doing the trick with the spool, Harry Terwilliger rummaged</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">through the arts and crafts stuff we kept in the restraint room, found the Crayolas, and brought them to</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">Delacroix with a smile that was almost embarrassed. &#34;I thought you might like to make that spool</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="728" height="19" font="3">different colors,&#34; he said. &#34;Then your little pal'd be like a circus mouse, or something.&#34;</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;A circus mouse!&#34; Delacroix said, looking completely, rapturously happy. I suppose he <i>was</i> completely</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">happy, maybe for the first time in his whole miserable life. &#34;That just what he is, too! A circus mouse!</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="711" height="19" font="3">When I get outta here, he gonna make me rich, like inna circus! You see if he don't.&#34;</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore would no doubt have pointed out to Delacroix that when he left Cold Mountain, he'd be</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">riding in an ambulance that didn't need to run its light or siren, but Harry knew better. He just told</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Delacroix to make the spool as colorful as he could as quick as he could, because he'd have to take the</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="218" height="19" font="3">crayons back after dinner.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">Del made it colorful, all right. When he was done, one end of the spool was yellow, the other end was</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">green, and the drum in the middle was firehouse red. We got used to hearing Delacroix trumpet,</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Maintenant, m'sieurs et mesdames! Le cirque presentement le mous' amusant et amazeant!&#34;</i> That wasn't</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">exactly it, but it gives you an idea of that stewpot French of his. Then he'd make this sound way down in</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">his throat - I think it was supposed to represent a drumroll - and fling the spool. Mr. Jingles would be</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">after it in a flash, either nosing it back or rolling it with his paws. That second way really was something</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">you would have paid to see in a circus, I think. Delacroix and his mouse and his mouse's brightly colored</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">spool were our chief amusements at the time that John Coffey came into our care and custody, and that</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">was the way things remained for awhile. Then my urinary infection, which had lain still for awhile, came</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="510" height="19" font="3">back, and William Wharton arrived, and all hell broke loose.</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="26" height="19" font="2"><b>10.</b></text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">The dates have mostly slipped out of my head. I suppose I could have my granddaughter, Danielle, look</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">some of them out of the old newspaper files, but what would be the point? The most important of them,</text>
</page>
<page number="59" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">like the day we came down to Delacroix's cell and found the mouse sitting on his shoulder, or the day</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">William Wharton came on the block and almost killed Dean Stanton, would not be in the papers,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">anyway. Maybe it's better to go on just as I have been; in the end, I guess the dates don't matter much, if</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="598" height="19" font="3">you can remember the things you saw and keep them in the right order.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">I know that things got squeezed together a little. When Delacroix's DOE papers finally came to me from</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">Curtis Anderson's office, I was amazed to see that our Cajun pal's date with Old Sparky had been</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">advanced from when we had expected, a thing that was almost unheard of, even in those days when you</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">didn't have to move half of heaven and all the earth to execute a man. It was a matter of two days, I think,</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">from the twenty-seventh of October to the twenty-fifth. Don't hold me to it exactly, but I know that's</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">close; I remember thinking that Toot was going to get his Corona box back even sooner than he had</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="80" height="19" font="3">expected.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">Wharton, meanwhile, got to us later than expected. For one thing, his trial ran longer than Anderson's</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">usually reliable sources had thought it would (when it came to Wild Billy, <i>nothing</i> was reliable, we</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">would soon discover, including our time-tested and supposedly foolproof methods of prisoner control).</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Then, after he had been found guilty - that much, at least, went according to the script - he was taken to</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">Indianola General Hospital for tests. He had had a number of supposed seizures during the trial, twice</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">serious enough to send him crashing to the floor, where he lay shaking and flopping and drumming his</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">feet on the boards. Wharton's court-appointed lawyer claimed he suffered from &#34;epilepsy spells&#34; and had</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">committed his crimes while of unsound mind; the prosecution claimed the fits were the sham acting of a</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">coward desperate to save his own life. After observing the so-called &#34;epilepsy spells&#34; at first hand, the</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">jury decided the fits were an act. The judge concurred but ordered a series of pre-sentencing tests after</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="593" height="19" font="3">the verdict came down. God knows why; perhaps he was only curious.</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">It's a blue-eyed wonder that Wharton didn't escape from the hospital (and the irony that Warden Moore's</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">wife, Melinda, was in the same hospital at the same time did not escape any of us), but he didn't. They</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">had him surrounded by guards, I suppose, and perhaps he still had hopes of being declared incompetent</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="381" height="19" font="3">by reason of epilepsy, if there is such a thing.</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">He wasn't. The doctors found nothing wrong with his brain - physiologically, at least - and Billy &#34;the</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Kid&#34; Wharton was at last bound for Cold Mountain. That might have been around the sixteenth or the</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">eighteenth; it's my recollection that Wharton arrived about two weeks after John Coffey and a week or</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="420" height="19" font="3">ten days before Delacroix walked the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">The day our new psychopath joined us was an eventful one for me. I woke up at four that morning with</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">my groin throbbing and my penis feeling hot and clogged and swollen. Even before I swung my feet out</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">of bed, I knew that my urinary infection wasn't getting better, as I had hoped. It had been a brief turn for</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="328" height="19" font="3">the better, that was all, and it was over.</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">I went out to the privy to do my business - this was at least three years before we put in our first</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">water-closet - and had gotten no further than the woodpile at the comer of the house when I realized I</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">couldn't hold it any longer. I lowered my pajama pants just as the urine started to flow, and that flow was</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">accompanied by the most excruciating. pain of my entire life. I passed a gall-stone in 1956, and I know</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">people say that is the worst, but that gall-stone was like a touch of acid indigestion compared to this</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="68" height="19" font="3">outrage.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">My knees came unhinged and I fell heavily onto them, tearing out the seat of my pajama pants when I</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">spread my legs to keep from losing my balance and going face-first into a puddle of my own piss. I still</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">might have gone over if I hadn't grabbed one of the woodpile logs with my left hand. All that, though,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">could have been going on in Australia, or even on another planet. All I was concerned with was the pain</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">that had set me on fire; my lower belly was burning, and my penis - an organ which had gone mostly</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">forgotten by me except when providing me the most intense physical pleasure a man can experience -</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">now felt as if it were melting; I expected to look down and see blood gushing from its tip, but it appeared</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">to be a perfectly ordinary stream of urine.</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">I hung onto the woodpile with one hand and put the other across my mouth, concentrating on keeping my</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">mouth shut. I did not want to frighten my wife awake with a scream. It seemed that I went on pissing</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">forever, but at last the stream dried up. By then the pain had sunk deep into my stomach and my testicles,</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">biting like rusty teeth. For a long while - it might have been as long as a minute - I was physically</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">incapable of getting up. At last the pain began to abate, and I struggled to my feet. I looked at my urine,</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">already soaking into the ground, and wondered if any sane God could make a world where such a little</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="539" height="19" font="3">bit of dampness could come at the cost of such horrendous pain.</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">I would call in sick, I thought, and go see Dr. Sadler after all. I didn't want the stink and the queasiness of</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Dr. Sadler's sulfa tablets, but anything would be better than kneeling beside the woodpile, trying not to</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">scream while my prick was reporting that it had apparently been doused with coal-oil and set afire.</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">Then, as I was swallowing aspirin in our kitchen and listening to Jan snore lightly in the other room, I</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">remembered that today was the day William Wharton was scheduled on the block, and that Brutal</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">wouldn't be there - the roster had him over on the other side of the prison, helping to move the rest of the</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">library and some leftover infirmary equipment to the new building. One thing I didn't feel right about in</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">spite of my pain was leaving Wharton to Dean and Harry. They were good men, but Curtis Anderson's</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">report had suggested that William Wharton was exceptionally bad news. This man just doesn't care, he</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="321" height="19" font="3">had written, underlining for emphasis.</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">By then the pain had abated some, and I could think. The best idea, it seemed to me, was to leave for the</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">prison early. I could get there at six, which was the time Warden Moores usually came in. He could get</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="776" height="19" font="3">Brutus Howell reassigned to E Block long enough for Wharton's reception, and I'd make my</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="610" height="19" font="3">long-overdue trip to the doctor. Cold Mountain was actually on my way.</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Twice on the twenty-mile ride to the Penitentiary that sudden need to urinate overcame me. Both times I</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">was able to pull over and take care of the problem without embarrassing myself (for one thing, traffic on</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">country roads at such an hour was all but nonexistent). Neither of these two voidings was as painful as</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">the one that had taken me off my feet on the way to the privy, but both times I had to clutch the</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">passenger-side doorhandle of my little Ford coupe to hold myself up, and I could feel sweat running</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="454" height="19" font="3">down my hot face. I was sick, all right, good and sick.</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I made it, though, drove in through the south gate, parked in my usual place, and went right up to see the</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">warden. It was going on six o'clock by then. Miss Hannah's office was empty - she wouldn't be in until</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">the relatively civilized hour of seven - but the light was on in Moores's office; I could see it through the</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">pebbled glass. I gave a perfunctory knock and opened the door. Moores looked up, startled to see anyone</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">at that unusual hour, and I would have given a great deal not to have been the one to see him in that</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">condition, with his face naked and unguarded. His white hair, usually so neatly combed, was sticking up</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">in tufts and tangles; his hands were in it, yanking and pulling, when I walked in. His eyes were raw, the</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">skin beneath them puffy and swollen. His palsy was the worst I had ever seen it; he looked like a man</text>

<page number="61" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="563" height="19" font="3">who had just come inside after a long walk on a terribly cold night.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="370" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hal, I'm sorry, I'll come back----!&#34; I began.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; he said. &#34;Please, Paul. Come in. Shut the door and come in. I need someone now, if I ever needed</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="450" height="19" font="3">anyone in my whole life. Shut the door and come in.&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="773" height="19" font="3">I did as he asked, forgetting my own pain for the first time since I'd awakened that morning.</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's a brain tumor,&#34; Moores said. &#34;They got X-ray pictures of it. They seemed real pleased with their</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">pictures, actually. One of them said they may be the best ones anyone's ever gotten, at least so far; said</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">they're going to publish them in some biggety medical journal up in New England. It's the size of a</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">lemon, they said, and way down deep inside, where they can't operate. They say she'll be dead by</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="702" height="19" font="3">Christmas. I haven't told her. I can't think how. I can't think how for the life of me.&#34;</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Then he began to cry, big, gasping sobs that filled me with both pity and a kind of terror - when a man</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">who keeps himself as tightly guarded as Hal Moores finally does lose control, it's frightening to watch. I</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">stood there for a moment, then went to him and put my arm around his shoulders. He groped out for me</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">with both of his own arms, like a drowning man, and began to sob against my stomach, all restraint</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">washed away. Later, after he got himself under control, he apologized. He did it without quite meeting</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">my eyes, as a man does when he feels he has embarrassed himself dreadfully, maybe so deeply that he</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">can never quite live it down. A man can end up hating the fellow who has seen him in such a state. I</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">thought Warden Moores was better than that, but it never crossed my mind to do the business I had</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">originally come for, and when I left Moores's office, I walked over to E Block instead of back to my car.</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">The aspirin was working by then, and the pain in my midsection was down to a low throb. I would get</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">through the day somehow, I reckoned, get Wharton settled in, check back with Hal Moores that</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">afternoon, and get my sick-leave for tomorrow. The worst was pretty much over, I thought, with no</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="577" height="19" font="3">slightest idea that the worst of that day's mischief hadn't even begun.</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="26" height="19" font="2"><b>11.</b></text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;We thought he was still doped from the tests,&#34; Dean said late that afternoon. His voice was low, rasping,</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">almost a bark, and there were blackish-purple bruises rising on his neck. I could see it was hurting him to</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">talk and thought of telling him to let it go, but sometimes it hurts more to be quiet. I judged that this was</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="777" height="19" font="3">one of those times, and kept my own mouth shut. &#34;We all thought he was doped, didn't we?&#34;</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger nodded. Even Percy, sitting off by himself in his own sullen little party of one, nodded.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Brutal glanced at me, and for a moment I met his eyes. We were thinking pretty much that same thing,</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">that this was the way it happened. You were cruising along, everything going according to Hoyle, you</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">made one mistake, and bang, the sky fell down on you. They had thought he was doped, it was a</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">reasonable assumption to make, but no one had <i>asked</i> if he was doped. I thought I saw something else in</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Brutal's eyes, as well: Harry and Dean would learn from their mistake. Especially Dean, who could easily</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">have gone home to his family dead. Percy wouldn't. Percy maybe couldn't. All Percy could do was sit in</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="439" height="19" font="3">the corner and sulk because he was in the shit again.</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">There were seven of them that went up to Indianola to take charge of Wild Bill Wharton: Harry, Dean,</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Percy, two other guards in the back (I have forgotten their names, although I'm sure I knew them once),</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">plus two up front. They took what we used to call the stagecoach - a Ford panel-truck which had been</text>

<page number="62" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">steel-reinforced and equipped with supposedly bulletproof glass. It looked like a cross between a</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="274" height="19" font="3">milk-wagon and an armored car.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger was technically in charge of the expedition. He handed his paperwork over to the</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">county sheriff (not Homer Cribus but some other elected yokel like him, I imagine), who in turn handed</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">over Mr. William Wharton, hellraiser extraordinaire, as Delacroix might have put it. A Cold Mountain</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">prison uniform had been sent ahead, but the sheriff and his men hadn't bothered to put Wharton in it; they</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">left that to our boys. Wharton was dressed in a cotton hospital johnny and cheap felt slippers when they</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">first met him on the second floor of the General Hospital, a scrawny man with a narrow, pimply face and</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">a lot of long, tangly blond hair. His ass, also narrow and also covered with pimples, stuck out the back of</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">the johnny. That was the part of him Harry and the others saw first, because Wharton was standing at the</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">window and looking out at the parking lot when they came in. He didn't turn but just stood there, holding</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">the curtains back with one hand, silent as a doll while Harry bitched at the county sheriff about being too</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">lazy to get Wharton into his prison blues and the county sheriff lectured - as every county official I've</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="602" height="19" font="3">ever met seems bound to do - about what was his job and what was not.</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">When Harry got tired of that part (I doubt it took him long), he told Wharton to turn around. Wharton</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">did. He looked, Dean told us in his raspy bark of a half-choked voice, like any one of a thousand</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">backcountry stampeders who had wound their way through Cold Mountain during our years there. Boil</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">that look down and what you got was a dullard with a mean steak. Sometimes you also discovered a</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">yellow streak in them, once their backs were to the wall, but more often there was nothing there but fight</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">and mean and then more fight and more mean. There are people who see nobility in folks like Billy</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Wharton, but I am not one of them. A rat will fight, too, if it is cornered. This man's face seemed to have</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">no more personality than his acne-studded backside, Dean told us. His jaw was slack, his eyes distant, his</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">shoulders slumped, his hands dangling. He looked shot up with morphine, all right, every bit as coo-coo</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="373" height="19" font="3">as any dopefiend any of them had ever seen.</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="386" height="19" font="3">At this, Percy gave another of his sullen nods.</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">&#34;Put this on,&#34; Harry said, indicating the uniform on the foot of the bed - it had been taken out of the</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">brown paper it was wrapped in, but otherwise not touched-it was still folded just as it had been in the</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">prison laundry, with a pair of white cotton boxer shorts poking out of one shirtsleeve and a pair of white</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="250" height="19" font="3">socks poking out of the other.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Wharton seemed willing enough to comply, but wasn't able to get very far without help. He managed the</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">boxers, but when it came to the pants, he kept trying to put both legs into the same hole. Finally Dean</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">helped him, getting his feet to go where they belonged and then yanking the trousers up, doing the fly,</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">and snapping the waistband.. Wharton only stood there, not even trying to help once he saw that Dean</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">was doing it for him. He stared vacantly across the room, hands lax, and it didn't occur to any of them</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">that he was shamming. Not in hopes of escape (at least I don't believe that was it) but only in hopes of</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="564" height="19" font="3">making the maximum amount of trouble when the right time came.</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">The papers were signed. William Wharton, who had become county property when he was arrested, now</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">became the state's property. He was taken down the back stairs and through the kitchen, surrounded by</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">bluesuits. He walked with his head down and his long-fingered hands dangling. The first time his cap fell</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="751" height="19" font="3">off, Dean put it back on him. The second time, he just tucked it into his own back pocket.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">He had another chance to make trouble in the back of the stagecoach, when they were shackling him, and</text>

<page number="63" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">didn't. If he thought (even now I'm not sure if he did, or if he did, how much), he must have thought that</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the space was too small and the numbers too great to cause a satisfactory hooraw. So on went the chains,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="784" height="19" font="3">one set running between his ankles and another set too long, it turned out, between his wrists.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">The drive to Cold Mountain took an hour. During that whole time, Wharton sat on the lefthand bench up</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">by the cab, head lowered, cuffed hands dangling between his knees. Every now and then he hummed a</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">little, Harry said, and Percy roused himself enough from his funk to say that the lugoon dripped spittle</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">from his lax lower lip, a drop at a time, until it had made a puddle between his feet. Like a dog dripping</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="388" height="19" font="3">off the end of its tongue on a hot summer day.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">They drove in through the south gate when they got to the pen, right past my car, I guess. The guard on</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">the south pass tan back the big door between the lot and the exercise yard, and the stagecoach drove</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">through. It was a slack time in the yard, not many men out and most of them hoeing in the garden.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Pumpkin time, it would have been. They drove straight across to E Block and stopped. The driver opened</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">the door and told them he was going to take the stagecoach over to the motor-pool to have the oil</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">changed, it had been good working with them. The extra guards went with the vehicle, two of them</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="528" height="19" font="3">sitting in the back eating apples, the doors now swinging open.</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">That left Dean, Harry and Percy with one shackled prisoner. It should have been enough, would have</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">been enough, if they hadn't been lulled by the stick thin country boy standing head-down there in the dirt</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">with chains on his wrists and ankles. They marched him the twelve or so paces to the door that opened</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">into E Block, falling into the same formation we used when escorting prisoners down the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Harry was on his left, Dean was on his right, and Percy was behind, with his baton in his hand. No one</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">told me that, but I know damned well he had it out; Percy loved that hickory stick. As for me, I was</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">sitting in what would be Wharton's home until it came time for him to check into the hot place-first cell</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">on the right as you headed down the corridor toward the restraint room. I had my clipboard in my hands</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">and was thinking of nothing but making my little set speech and getting the hell out. The pain in my</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">groin was building up again, and all I wanted was to go into my office and wait for it to pass.</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Dean stepped forward to unlock the door. He selected the right key from the bunch on his belt and slid it</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">into the lock. Wharton came alive just as Dean turned the key and pulled the handle. He voiced a</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">screaming, gibbering cry - a kind of Rebel yell - that froze Harry to temporary immobility and pretty</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">much finished Percy Wetmore for the entire encounter. I heard that scream through the partly opened</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">door and didn't associate it with anything human at first; I thought a dog had gotten into the yard</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="746" height="19" font="3">somehow and had been hurt; that perhaps some mean tempered con had hit it with a hoe.</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">Wharton lifted his arms, dropped the chain which hung between his wrists over Dean's head, and</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">commenced to choke him with it. Dean gave a strangled cry and lurched forward, into the cool electric</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">light of our little world. Wharton was happy to go with him, even gave him a shove, all the time yelling</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">and gibbering, even laughing. He had his arms cocked at the elbows with his fists up by Dean's ears,</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="576" height="19" font="3">yanking the chain as tight as he could, whipsawing it back and forth.</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Harry landed on Wharton's back, wrapping one hand in our new boy's greasy blond hair and slamming</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">his other fist into the side of Wharton's face as hard as he could. He had both a baton of his own and a</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">sidearm pistol, but in his excitement drew neither. We'd had trouble with prisoners before, you bet, but</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">never one who'd taken any of us by surprise the way that Wharton did. The man's slyness was beyond</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="646" height="19" font="3">our experience. I had never seen its like before, and have never seen it again.</text>

<page number="64" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">And he was strong. All that slack looseness was gone. Harry said later that it was like jumping onto a</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">coiled nest of steel springs that had somehow come to life. Wharton, now inside and near the duty desk,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="654" height="19" font="3">whirled to his left and flung Harry off. Harry hit the desk and went sprawling.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="650" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Whoooee, boys!&#34;</i> Wharton laughed. <i>&#34;Ain't this a party, now? Is it, or what?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Still screaming and laughing, Wharton went back to choking Dean with his chain. Why not? Wharton</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="458" height="19" font="3">knew what we all knew: they could only fry him once.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hit him, Percy, hit him!&#34; Harry screamed, struggling to his feet. But Percy only stood there, hickory</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">baton in hand, eyes as wide as soup-plates. Here was the chance he'd been looking for, you would have</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">said, his golden opportunity to put that tallywhacker of his to good use, and he was too scared and</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">confused to do it. This wasn't some terrified little Frenchman or a black giant who hardly seemed to be in</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="336" height="19" font="3">his own body; this was a whirling devil.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I came out of Wharton's cell, dropping my clipboard and pulling my .38. I had forgotten the infection that</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">was heating up my middle for the second time that day. I didn't doubt the story the others told of</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Wharton's blank face and dull eyes when they told it, but that wasn't the Wharton I saw. What I saw was</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">the face of an animal - not an intelligent animal, but one filled with cunning ... and meanness ... and joy.</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Yes. He was doing what he had been made to do. The place and the circumstances didn't matter. The</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">other thing I saw was Dean Stanton's red, swelling face. He was dying in front of my eyes. Wharton saw</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">the gun and turned Dean toward it, so that I'd almost certainly have to hit one to hit the other. From over</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="478" height="19" font="3">Dean's shoulder, one blazing blue eye dared me to shoot.</text>

<text top="923" left="15" width="671" height="19" font="3">brochure doesn't call us &#34;inmates,&#34; but sometimes I do) just call it the TV room.</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Folks think I'm stand-offy because I don't go down to the TV room much in the day, but it's the programs</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I can't stand, not the folks. Oprah, Ricki Lake, Carnie Wilson, Rolanda - the world is falling down around</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">our ears, and all these people care for is talking about fucking to women in short skirts and men with</text>

<text top="1106" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">their sirens screaming and their blue lights flashing. My special friend, Elaine Connelly, feels the same</text>

<page number="65" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">way. Elaine is eighty, tall and slim, still erect and clear-eyed, very intelligent and refined. She walks very</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">slowly because there's something wrong with her hips, and I know that the arthritis in her hands gives her</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">terrible misery, but she has a beautiful long neck - a swan neck, almost - and long, pretty hair that falls to</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="305" height="19" font="3">her shoulders when she lets it down.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Best of all, she doesn't think I'm peculiar, or stand-offy. We spend a lot of time together, Elaine and I. If I</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">hadn't reached such a grotesque age, I suppose I might speak of her as my ladyfriend. Still, having a</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">special friend - just that - is not so bad, and in some ways, it's even better. A lot of the problems and</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">heartaches that go with being boyfriend and girlfriend have simply burned out of us. And although I</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">know that no one under the age of, say, fifty would believe this, sometimes the embers are better than the</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="285" height="19" font="3">campfire. It's strange, but it's true.</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">So I don't watch TV during the day. Sometimes I walk; sometimes I read; mostly what I've been doing</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">for the last month or so is writing this memoir among the plants in the solarium. I think there's more</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">oxygen in that room, and it helps the old memory. It beats the hell out of Geraldo Rivera, I can tell you</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="37" height="19" font="3">that.</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">But when I can't sleep, I sometimes creep downstairs and put on the television. There's no Home Box</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">Office or anything at Georgia Pines - I guess that's a resource just a wee bit too expensive for our</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Resource Center - but we have the basic cable services, and that means we have the American Movie</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Channel. That's the one (just in case you don't have the basic cable services yourself) where most of the</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">films are in black and white and none of the women take their clothes off. For an old fart like me, that's</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">sort of soothing. There have been a good many nights when I've slipped right off to sleep on the ugly</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">green sofa in front of the TV while Francis the Talking Mule once more pulls Donald O'Connor's skillet</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">out of the fire, or John Wayne cleans up Dodge, or Jimmy Cagney calls someone a dirty rat and then</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">pulls a gun. Some of them are movies I saw with my wife, Janice (not just my ladyfriend but my <i>best</i></text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">friend), and they calm me. The clothes they wear, the way they walk and talk, even the music on the</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">soundtrack - all those things calm me. They remind me, I suppose, of when I was a man still walking on</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">the skin of the world, instead of a moth-eaten relic mouldering away in an old folks' home where many of</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="368" height="19" font="3">the residents wear diapers and rubber pants.</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="694" height="19" font="3">There was nothing soothing about what I saw this morning, though. Nothing at all.</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Elaine sometimes joins me for AMC's so-called Early Bird Matinee, which starts at 4:00 a.m. - she</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">doesn't say much about it, but I know her arthritis hurts her something terrible, and that the drugs they</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="292" height="19" font="3">give her don't help much anymore.</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">When she came in this morning, gliding like a ghost in her white terrycloth robe, she found me sitting on</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">the lumpy sofa, bent over the scrawny sticks that used to be legs, and clutching my knees to try and still</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">the shakes that were running through me like a high wind. I felt cold all over, except for my groin, which</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">seemed to burn with the ghost of the urinary infection which had so troubled my life in the fall of 1932 -</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="637" height="19" font="3">the fall of John Coffey, Percy Wetmore, and Mr. Jingles, the trained mouse.</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="387" height="19" font="3">The fall of William Wharton, it had been, too.</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul!&#34; Elaine cried, and hurried over to me hurried as fast as the rusty nails and ground glass in her hips</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="377" height="19" font="3">would allow, anyway. &#34;Paul, what's wrong?&#34;</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll be all right,&#34; I said, but the words didn't sound very convincing - they came out all uneven, through</text>

<page number="66" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="667" height="19" font="3">teeth that wanted to chatter. &#34;Just give me a minute or two, I'll be right as rain.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">She sat next to me and put her arm around my shoulders. &#34;I'm sure,&#34; she said. &#34;But what happened? For</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="437" height="19" font="3">heaven's sake, Paul, you look like you saw a ghost.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="674" height="19" font="4"><i>I did,</i> I thought, and didn't realize until her eyes widened that I'd said it out loud.</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="785" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not really.&#34; I said, and patted her hand (gently - so gently!). &#34;But for a minute. Elaine God!&#34;</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">&#34;Was it from the time when you were a guard at the prison?&#34; she asked. &#34;The time that you've been</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="262" height="19" font="3">writing about in the solarium?&#34;</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">I nodded. &#34;I worked on our version of Death Row - &#34;</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="94" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know - &#34;</text>
<text top="356" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;Only we called it the Green Mile. Because of the linoleum on the floor. In the fall of '32, we got this</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">fellow - we got this wildman - named William Wharton. Liked to think of himself as Billy the Kid, even</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">had it tattooed on his arm. Just a kid, but dangerous. I can still remember what Curtis Anderson - he was</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">the assistant warden back in those days - wrote about him. 'Crazy-wild and proud of it. Wharton is</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="596" height="19" font="3">nineteen years old, and <i>he just doesn't</i> care.' He'd underlined that part.&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">The hand which had gone around my shoulders was now rubbing my back. I was beginning to calm. In</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">that moment I loved Elaine Connelly, and could have kissed her all over her face as I told her so. Maybe</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">I should have. It's terrible to be alone and frightened at any age, but I think it's worst when you're old.</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="702" height="19" font="3">But I had this other thing on my mind, this load of old and still unfinished business.</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Anyway,&#34; I said, &#34;you're right-I've been scribbling about how Wharton came on the block and almost</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="661" height="19" font="3">killed Dean Stanton - One of the guys I worked with back then - when he did.&#34;</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="324" height="19" font="3">&#34;How could he do that?&#34; Elaine asked.</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">&#34;Meanness and carelessness,&#34; I said grimly. &#34;Wharton supplied the meanness, and the guards who</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">brought him in supplied the carelessness. The real mistake was Wharton's wrist-chain - it was a little too</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">long. When Dean unlocked the door to E Block, Wharton was behind him. There were guards on either</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">side of him, but Anderson was right - Wild Billy just didn't care about such things. He dropped that</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="576" height="19" font="3">wrist-chain down over Dean's head and started choking him with it.&#34;</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="150" height="19" font="3">Elaine shuddered.</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">&#34;Anyway, I got thinking about all that and couldn't sleep, so I came down here. I turned on AMC,</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="526" height="19" font="3">thinking you might come down and we'd have us a little date-&#34;</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">She laughed and kissed my forehead just above the eyebrow. It used to make me prickle all over when</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Janice did that, and it still made me prickle all over when Elaine did it early this morning. I guess some</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="209" height="19" font="3">things don't ever change.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;-and what came on was this old black-and-white gangster movie from the forties. Kiss <i>of Death,</i> it's</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">called.&#34;</text>

<text top="170" left="15" width="651" height="19" font="3">I was starting to shiver again in spite of my best efforts. I just couldn't help it.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Blond hair,&#34; I whispered. &#34;Lank blond hair. I watched until the part where he pushed this old woman in</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">a wheelchair down a flight of stairs, then I turned it off.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="274" height="19" font="3">&#34;He reminded you of Wharton?&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="337" height="19" font="3">&#34;He <i>was</i> Wharton,&#34; I said. &#34;To the life!&#34;</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul----!' she began, and stopped. She looked at the blank screen of the TV (the cable box on top of it</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">was still on, the red numerals still showing 10, the number of the AMC channel), then back at me.</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;What?&#34; I asked. 'What, Elaine?&#34; Thinking, <i>She's going to tell, me I ought to quit writing about it. That I</i></text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="532" height="19" font="4"><i>ought to tear up the pages I've written so far and just quit on it.</i></text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="370" height="19" font="3">What she said was &#34;Don't let this stop you!&#34;</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="135" height="19" font="3">I gawped at her.</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="378" height="19" font="3">&#34;Close your mouth, Paul - you'll catch a fly.&#34;</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="265" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sorry. It's just that ... well . . .&#34;</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="563" height="19" font="3">&#34;You thought I was going to tell you just the opposite, didn't you?&#34;</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. &#34;</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">She took my hands in hers (gently, so gently - her long and beautiful fingers, her bunched and ugly</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">knuckles) and leaned forward, fixing my blue eyes with her hazel ones, the left slightly dimmed by the</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">mist of a coalescing cataract. &#34;I may be too old and brittle to live,&#34; she said, &#34;but I'm not too old to think.</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">What's a few sleepless nights at our age? What's seeing a ghost on the TV, for that matter? Are you going</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="379" height="19" font="3">to tell me it's the only one you've ever seen?&#34;</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I thought about Warden Moores, and Harry Terwilliger, and Brutus Howell; I thought about MY mother,</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">and about Jan, my wife, who died in Alabama. I knew about ghosts, all right.</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; I said. &#34;It wasn't the first ghost I've ever seen. But Elaine - it <i>was </i>a shock. Because it was him.&#34;</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">She kissed me again, then stood up, wincing as she did so and pressing the heels of her hands to the tops</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">of her hips, as if she were afraid they might actually explode out through her skin if she wasn't very</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">careful.</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think I've changed my mind about the television,&#34; she said. &#34;I've got an extra pill that I've been keeping</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">for a rainy day ... or night. I think I'll take it and go back to bed. Maybe you should do the same.&#34;</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said. &#34;I suppose I should!&#34; For one wild moment I thought of suggesting that we go back to bed</text>
</page>
<page number="68" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">together, and then I saw the dull pain in her eyes and thought better of it. Because she might have said</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">yes, and she would only have said that for me. Not so good.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">We left the TV room (I won't dignify it with that other name, not even to be ironic) side by side, me</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">matching my steps to hers, which were slow and painfully careful. The building was quiet except for</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="595" height="19" font="3">someone moaning in the grip of a bad dream behind some closed door.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">&#34;Will you be able to sleep, do you think?&#34; she asked.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, I think so,&#34; I said, but of course I wasn't able to; I lay in my bed until sunup, thinking about Kiss <i>of</i></text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="4"><i>Death.</i> I'd see Richard Widmark, giggling madly, tying the old lady into her wheelchair and then pushing</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">her down the stairs -&#34;This is what we do to squealers,&#34; he told her-and then his face would merge into the</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">face of William Wharton as he'd looked on the day when he came to E Block and the Green Mile -</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Wharton giggling like Widmark, Wharton screaming, <i>Ain't this a pa&#34;, now? Is it, or what?</i> I didn't bother</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="731" height="19" font="3">with breakfast, not after that; I just came down here to the solarium and began to write.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="117" height="19" font="3">Ghosts? Sure.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="201" height="19" font="3">I know all about ghosts.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>2.</b></text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="641" height="19" font="3">&#34;W<i>oooee, boys!&#34;</i> Wharton laughed. <i>&#34;Ain't this a party, now? Is it, or what?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Still screaming and laughing, Wharton went back to choking Dean with his chain. Why not? Wharton</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">knew what Dean and Harry and my friend Brutus Howell knew - they could only fry a man once.</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hit him!&#34; Harry Terwilliger screamed. He had grappled with Wharton, tried to stop things before they</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">got fairly started, but Wharton had thrown him off and now Harry was trying to find his feet. &#34;Percy, hit</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="48" height="19" font="3">him!&#34;</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">But Percy only stood there, hickory baton in hand, eyes as wide as soup-plates. He loved that damned</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">baton of his, and you would have said this was the chance to use it he'd been pining for ever since he</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="785" height="19" font="3">came to Cold Mountain Penitentiary ... but now that it had come, he was too scared to use the</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">opportunity. This wasn't some terrified little Frenchman like Delacroix or a black giant who hardly</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="713" height="19" font="3">seemed to know he was in his own body, like John Coffey; this was a whirling devil.</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">I came out of Wharton's cell, dropping my clipboard and pulling my .38. For the second time that day I</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">had forgotten the infection that was heating up my middle. I didn't doubt the story the others told of</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Wharton's blank face and dull eyes when they recounted it later, but that wasn't the Wharton I saw. What</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">I saw was the face of an animal - not an intelligent animal, but one filled with cunning ... and meanness</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">... and joy. Yes. He was doing what he had been made to do. The place and the circumstances didn't</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">matter. The other thing I saw was Dean Stanton's red, swelling face. He was dying in front of my eyes.</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Wharton saw the gun in my hand and turned Dean toward it, so that I'd almost certainly have to hit one to</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">hit the other. From over Dean's shoulder, one blazing blue eye dared me to shoot. Wharton's other eye</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">was hidden by Dean's hair. Behind them I saw Percy standing irresolute, with his baton half-raised. And</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">then, filling the open doorway to the prison yard, a miracle in the flesh: Brutus Howell. They had</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">finished moving the last of the infirmary equipment, and he had come over to see who wanted coffee.</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">He acted without a moment's hesitation - shoved Percy aside and into the wall with tooth-rattling force,</text>
</page>
<page number="69" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">pulled his own baton out of its loop, and brought it crashing down on the back of Wharton's head with all</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the force in his massive right arm. There was a dull <i>whock!</i> Sound - an almost hollow sound, as if there</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">were no brain at all under Wharton's skull - and the chain finally loosened around Dean's neck. Wharton</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">went down like a sack of meal and Dean crawled away, hacking harshly and holding one hand to his</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="201" height="19" font="3">throat, his eyes bulging.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">I knelt by him and he shook his head violently. &#34;Okay,&#34; he rasped. &#34;Take care ... him!&#34; He motioned at</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="199" height="19" font="3">Wharton. &#34;Lock! Cell!&#34;</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I didn't think he'd need a cell, as hard as Brutal had hit him; I thought he'd need a coffin. No such luck,</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">though. Wharton was conked out, but a long way from dead. He lay sprawled on his side, one arm</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">thrown out so that the tips of his fingers touched the linoleum of the Green Mile, his eyes shut, his</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">breathing slow but regular. There was even a peaceful little smile on his face, as if he'd gone to sleep</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">listening to his favorite lullaby. A tiny red rill of blood was seeping out of his hair and staining the collar</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="306" height="19" font="3">of his new prison shirt. That was all.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="228" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy,&#34; I said. &#34;Help me!&#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Percy didn't move, only stood against the wall, staring with wide, stunned eyes. I don't think he knew</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="185" height="19" font="3">exactly where he was.</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="329" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy, goddammit, grab hold of him!&#34;</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">He got moving, then, and Harry helped him. Together the three of us hauled the unconscious Mr.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Wharton into his cell while Brutal helped Dean to his feet and held him as gently as any mother while</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="425" height="19" font="3">Dean bent over and hacked air back into his lungs.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Our new problem child didn't wake up for almost three hours, but when he did, he showed absolutely no</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">ill effects from Brutal's savage hit. He came to the way he moved - fast. At one moment he was lying on</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">his bunk, dead to the world. At the next he was standing at the bars - he was silent as a cat - and staring</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">out at me as I sat at the duty desk, writing a report on the incident. When I finally sensed someone</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">looking at me and glanced up, there he was, his grin displaying a set of blackening, dying teeth with</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">several gaps among them already. It gave me a jump to see him there like that. I tried not to show it, but I</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">think he knew. &#34;Hey, flunky,&#34; he said. &#34;Next time it'll be you. And I won't miss.&#34;</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hello, Wharton,&#34; I said, as evenly as I could. &#34;Under the circumstances, I guess I can skip the speech</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="368" height="19" font="3">and the Welcome Wagon, don't you think?&#34;</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">His grin faltered just a little. It wasn't the sort of response he had expected, and probably wasn't the one I</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="798" height="19" font="3">would have given under other circumstances. But something had happened while Wharton was</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">unconscious. It is, I suppose, one of the major things I have trudged through all these pages to tell you</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="347" height="19" font="3">about. Now let's just see if you believe it.</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>3.</b></text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Except for shouting once at Delacroix, Percy kept his mouth shut once the excitement was over. This was</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">probably the result of shock rather than any effort at tact - Percy Wetmore knew as much about tact as I</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">do about the native tribes of darkest Africa, in my opinion - but it was a damned good thing, just the</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">same. If he'd started in whining about how Brutal had pushed him into the wall or wondering why no one</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">had told him that nasty men like Wild Billy Wharton sometimes turned up on E Block, I think we would</text>
</page>
<page number="70" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">have killed him. Then we could have toured the Green Mile in a whole new way. That's sort of a funny</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="762" height="19" font="3">idea, when you consider it. I missed my chance to make like James Cagney in Whi<i>te Heat.</i></text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Anyway, when we were sure that Dean was going to keep breathing and that he wasn't going to pass out</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">on the spot, Harry and Brutal escorted him over to the infirmary. Delacroix, who had been absolutely</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">silent during the scuffle (he had been in prison lots of times, that one, and knew when it was prudent to</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">keep his yap shut and when it was relatively safe to open it again), began bawling loudly down the</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">corridor as Harry and Brutal helped Dean out. Delacroix wanted to know what had happened. You would</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="470" height="19" font="3">have thought his constitutional rights had been violated.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up, you little queer!&#34; Percy yelled back, so furious that the veins stood out on the sides of his neck.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">I put a hand on his arm and felt it quivering beneath his shirt. Some of this was residual fright, of course</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="786" height="19" font="3">(every now and then I had to remind myself that part of Percy's problem was that he was only</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">twenty-one, not much older than Wharton), but I think most of it was rage. He hated Delacroix. I don't</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="223" height="19" font="3">know just why, but he did.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go see if Warden Moores is still here,&#34; I told Percy. &#34;If he is, give him a complete verbal report on what</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="759" height="19" font="3">happened. Tell him he'll have my written report on his desk tomorrow, if I can manage it.&#34;</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Percy swelled visibly at this responsibility; for a horrible moment or two, I actually thought he might</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="201" height="19" font="3">salute. &#34;Yes, sir. I will.&#34;</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;Begin by telling him that the situation in E Block is normal. It's not a story, and the warden won't</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="476" height="19" font="3">appreciate you dragging it out to heighten the suspense.&#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="80" height="19" font="3">&#34;I won't.&#34;</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="171" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay. Off you go.&#34;</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">He started for the door, then turned back. The one thing you could count on with him was contrariness. I</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="760" height="19" font="3">desperately wanted him gone, my groin was on fire, and now he didn't seem to want to go.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;Are you all right, Paul?&#34; he asked. &#34;Running a fever, maybe? Got a touch of the grippe? Cause there's</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="214" height="19" font="3">sweat all over your face.&#34;</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">&#34;I might have a touch of something, but mostly I'm fine,&#34; I said. &#34;Go on, Percy, tell the warden.&#34;</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">He nodded and left - thank Christ for small favors. As soon as the door was closed, I lunged into my</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">office. Leaving the duty desk unmanned was against regulations, but I was beyond caring about that. It</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">was bad - like it had been that morning.</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">I managed to get into the little toilet cubicle behind the desk and to get my business out of my pants</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">before the urine started to gush, but it was a near thing. I had to put a hand over my mouth to stifle a</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">scream as I began to flow, and grabbed blindly for the lip of the washstand with the other. It wasn't like</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">my house, where I could fall to my knees and piss a puddle beside the woodpile; if I went to my knees</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="356" height="19" font="3">here, the urine would go all over the floor.</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I managed to keep my feet and not to scream, but it was a close thing on both counts. It felt like my urine</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">had been filled with tiny slivers of broken glass. The smell coming up from the toilet bowl was swampy</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I took the towel off the rack and wiped my face with it. I was sweating, all right; it was pouring off me. I</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">looked into the metal mirror and saw the flushed face of a man running a high fever looking back at me.</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="329" height="19" font="3">Hundred and three? Hundred and four?</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Better not to know, maybe. I put the towel back on its bar, flushed the toilet, and walked slowly back</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">across my office to the cellblock door. I was afraid Bill Dodge or someone else might have come in and</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">seen three prisoners with no attendants, but the place was empty. Wharton still lay unconscious on his</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">bunk, Delacroix had fallen silent, and John Coffey had never made a single noise at all, I suddenly</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="373" height="19" font="3">realized. Not a peep. Which was worrisome.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I went down the Mile and glanced into Coffey's cell, half-expecting to discover he'd committed suicide in</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">one of the two common Death Row ways either hanging himself with his pants, or gnawing into his</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">wrists. No such thing, it turned out. Coffey merely sat on the end of his bunk with his hands in his lap,</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="679" height="19" font="3">the largest man I'd ever seen in my life, looking at me with his strange, wet eyes.</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="144" height="19" font="3">&#34;Cap'n?&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="184" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's up, big boy?&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="165" height="19" font="3">&#34;I need to see you.&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="384" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ain't you looking right at me, John Coffey?&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="740" height="19" font="3">He said nothing to this, only went on studying me with his strange, leaky gaze. I sighed.</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="192" height="19" font="3">&#34;In a second, big boy.&#34;</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I looked over at Delacroix, who was standing at the bars of his cell. Mr. Jingles, his pet mouse (Delacroix</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">would tell you he'd trained Mr. Jingles to do tricks, but us folks who worked on the Green Mile were</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">pretty much unanimous in the opinion that Mr. Jingles had trained himself), was jumping restlessly back</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">and forth from one of Del's outstretched hands to the other, like an acrobat doing leaps from platforms</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">high above the center ring. His eyes were huge, his ears laid back against his sleek brown skull. I hadn't</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">any doubt that the mouse was reacting to Delacroix's nerves. As I watched, he ran down Delacroix's</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">pants leg and across the cell to where the brightly colored spool lay against one wall. He pushed the</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">spool back to Delacroix's foot and then looked up at him eagerly, but the little Cajun took no notice of his</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="280" height="19" font="3">friend, at least for the time being.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="489" height="19" font="3">&#34;What happen, boss?&#34; Delacroix asked. &#34;Who been hurt?&#34;</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Everything's jake,&#34; I said. &#34;Our new boy came in like a lion, but now he's passed out like a lamb. All's</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="172" height="19" font="3">well that ends well.&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">&#34;It ain't over yet,&#34; Delacroix said, looking up the Mile toward the cell where Wharton was jugged.</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="217" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;L'homme mauvais, c'est&#34;</i></text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well,&#34; I said, &#34;don't let it get you down, Del. Nobody's going to make you play skiprope with him out in</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="82" height="19" font="3">the yard.&#34;</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">There was a creaking sound from behind me as Coffey got off his bunk. &#34;Boss Edgecombe!&#34; he said</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="498" height="19" font="3">again. This time he sounded urgent. &#34;I need to talk to you!&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="72" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">I turned to him, thinking, all right, no problem, talking was my business. All the time trying not to shiver,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">because the fever had turned cold, as they sometimes will. Except for my groin, which still felt as if it</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="597" height="19" font="3">had been slit open, filled with hot coals, and then sewed back up again.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;So talk, John Coffey,&#34; I said, trying to keep my voice light and calm. For the first time since he'd come</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">onto E Block, Coffey looked as though he was really here, really among us. The almost ceaseless trickle</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">of tears from the corners of his eyes <i>had</i> ceased, at least for the time being, and I knew he was seeing</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">what he was looking at - Mr. Paul Edgecombe, E Block's bull-goose screw, and not some place he</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="575" height="19" font="3">wished he could return to, and take back the terrible thing he'd done.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="349" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; he said. &#34;You got to come in here.&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;Now, you know I can't do that,&#34; I said, still trying for the light tone, &#34;at least not right this minute. I'm</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">on my own here for the time being, and you outweigh me by just about a ton and a half. We've had us</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">one hooraw this afternoon, and that's enough. So we'll just have us a chat through the bars, if it's all the</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="168" height="19" font="3">same to you, and - &#34;</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Please!&#34; He was holding the bars so tightly that his knuckles were pale and his fingernails were white.</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">His face was long with distress, those strange eyes sharp with some need I could not understand. I</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">remember thinking that maybe I <i>could've</i> understood it if I hadn't been so sick, and knowing that would</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">have given me a way of helping him through the rest of it. When you know what a man needs, you know</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="673" height="19" font="3">the man, more often than not. &#34;Please, Boss Edgecombe! You <i>have to come in!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="4"><i>That's the nuttiest thing I ever heard,</i> I thought, and then realized something even nuttier: I was going to</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">do it. I had my keys off my belt and I was hunting through them for the ones that opened John Coffey's</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">cell. He could have picked me up and broken me over his knee like kindling on a day when I was well</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">and feeling fine, and this wasn't that day. All the same, I was going to do it. On my own, and less than</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">half an hour after a graphic demonstration of where stupidity and laxness could get you when you were</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">dealing with condemned murderers, I was going to open this black giant's cell, go in, and sit with him. If</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I was discovered, I might well lose my job even if he didn't do anything crazy, but I was going to do it,</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="115" height="19" font="3">just the same.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Stop, I said to myself, you just stop now, Paul. But I didn't. I used one key on the top lock, another on the</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="454" height="19" font="3">bottom lock, and then I slid the door back on its track.</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;You know, boss, that maybe not such a good idear,&#34; Delacroix said in a voice so nervous and prissy it</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="542" height="19" font="3">would probably have made me laugh under other circumstances.</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;You mind your business and I'll mind mine,&#34; I said without looking around. My eyes were fixed on John</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Coffey's, and fixed so hard they might have been nailed there. It was like being hypnotized. My voice</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">sounded to my own ears like something which had come echoing down a long valley. Hell, maybe I was</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="439" height="19" font="3">hypnotized. &#34;You just lie down and take you a rest.&#34;</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ, this place is crazy,&#34; Delacroix said in a trembling voice. &#34;Mr. Jingles, I just about wish they'd fry</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="207" height="19" font="3">me and be done widdit!&#34;</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">I went into Coffey's cell. He stepped away as I stepped forward. When he was backed up against his</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">bunk - it hit him in the calves, that's how tall he was - he sat down on it. He patted the mattress beside</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">him, his eyes never once leaving mine. I sat down there next to him, and he put his arm around my</text>
</page>
<page number="73" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">shoulders, as if we were at the movies and I was his girl.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="789" height="19" font="3">&#34;What do you want, John Coffey?&#34; I asked, still looking into his eyes - those sad, serene eyes.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just to help,&#34; he said. He sighed like a man will when he's faced with a job he doesn't much want to do,</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="795" height="19" font="3">and then he put his hand down in my crotch, on that shelf of bone a foot or so below the navel.</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="360" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey!&#34; I cried. &#34;Get your goddam hand---&#34;</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">A jolt slammed through me then, a big painless whack of something. It made me jerk on the cot and bow</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">my back, made me think of Old Toot shouting that he was frying, he was frying, he was a done tom</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">turkey. There was no heat, no feeling of electricity, but for a moment the color seemed to jump out of</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">everything, as if the world had been somehow squeezed and made to sweat. I could see every pore on</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">john Coffey's face, I could see every bloodshot snap in his haunted eyes, I could see a tiny healing scrape</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">on his chin. I was aware that my fingers were hooked down into claws on thin air, and that my feet were</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="330" height="19" font="3">drumming on the floor of Coffey's cell.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Then it was over. So was my urinary infection. Both the heat and the miserable throbbing pain were gone</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">from my crotch, and the fever was likewise gone from my head. I could still feel the sweat it had drawn</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="514" height="19" font="3">out of my skin, and I could smell it, but it was gone, all right.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's going on?&#34; Delacroix called shrilly. His voice still came from far away, but when John Coffey</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">bent forward, breaking eye-contact with me, the little Cajun's voice suddenly came clear. It was as if</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">someone had pulled wads of cotton or a pair of shooters' plugs out of my ears. &#34;What's he doing to you?&#34;</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I didn't answer. Coffey was bent forward over his own lap with his face working and his throat bulging.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="761" height="19" font="3">His eyes were bulging, too. He looked like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">&#34;John!&#34; I said. I clapped him on the back; it was all I could think of to do. &#34;John, what's wrong?&#34;</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">He hitched under my hand, then made an unpleasant gagging, retching sound. His mouth opened the way</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">horses sometimes open their mouths to allow the bit - reluctantly, with the lips peeling back from the</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">teeth in a kind of desperate sneer. Then his teeth parted, too, and he exhaled a cloud of tiny black insects</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">that looked like gnats or noseeums. They swirled furiously between his knees, turned white, and</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="106" height="19" font="3">disappeared.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Suddenly all the strength went out of my middsection. It was as if the muscles there had turned to water.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">I slumped back against the stone side of Coffey's cell. I remember thinking the name of the Savior -</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Christ, Christ, Christ, over and over, like that - and I remember thinking that the fever had driven me</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="192" height="19" font="3">delirious. That was all.</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Then I became aware that Delacroix was bawling for help; he was telling the world that John Coffey was</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">killing me, and telling it at the top of his lungs. Coffey was bending over me, all right, but only to make</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="136" height="19" font="3">sure I was okay.</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up, Del,&#34; I said, and got on my feet. I waited for the pain to rip into my guts, but it didn't happen. I</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">was better. Really. There was a moment of dizziness, but that passed even before I was able to reach out</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="634" height="19" font="3">and grab the bars of Coffey's cell door for balance. &#34;I'm totally okey-doke.&#34;</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;You get on outta here,&#34; Delacroix said, sounding like a nervy old woman telling a kid to climb down out</text>
</page>
<page number="74" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="713" height="19" font="3">of that-ere apple tree. &#34;You ain't suppose to be in there wit no one else on the block.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">I looked at John Coffey, who sat on the bunk with his huge hands on the tree stumps of his knees. John</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="624" height="19" font="3">Coffey looked back at me. He had to tilt his head up a little, but not much.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="660" height="19" font="3">&#34;What did you do, big boy?&#34; I asked in a low voice. &#34;What did you do to me?&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="339" height="19" font="3">&#34;Helped,&#34; he said. &#34;I helped it, didn't I?&#34;</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, I guess, but how? How did you help it?&#34;</text>
<text top="254" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">He shook his head - right, left, back to dead center. He didn't know how he'd helped it (how he'd cured it)</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">and his placid face suggested that he didn't give a rat's ass - any more than I'd give a rat's ass about the</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">mechanics of running when I was leading in the last fifty yards of a Fourth of July Two-Miler. I thought</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">about asking him how he'd known I was sick in the first place, except that would undoubtedly have</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">gotten the same headshake. There's a phrase I read somewhere and never forgot, something about &#34;an</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">enigma wrapped in a mystery.&#34; That's what John Coffey was, and I suppose the only reason he could</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">sleep at night was because he didn't care. Percy called him the ijit, which was cruel but not too far off the</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">mark. Our big boy knew his name, and knew it wasn't spelled like the drink, and that was just about all</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="149" height="19" font="3">he cared to know.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">As if to emphasize this for me, he shook his head m that deliberate way one more time, then lay down on</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">his bunk with his hands clasped under his left cheek like a pillow and his face to the wall. His legs</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">dangled off the end of the bunk from the shins on down, but that never seemed to bother him. The back</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="643" height="19" font="3">of his shirt had pulled up, and I could see the scars that crisscrossed his skin.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">I left the cell, turned the locks, then faced Delacroix, who was standing across the way with his hands</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">wrapped around the bars of his cell, looking at me anxiously. Perhaps even fearfully. Mr. Jingles perched</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">on his shoulder with his fine whiskers quivering like filaments. &#34;What dat darkie-man do to you?&#34;</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Delacroix asked. &#34;Waddit gris-gris? He th'ow some gris-gris on you?&#34; Spoken in that Cajun accent of his,</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="258" height="19" font="3">gris-gris rhymed with <i>pee-pee.</i></text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="387" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know what you're talking about, Del.&#34;</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="590" height="19" font="3">&#34;Devil you don't! Lookit you! All change! Even walk different, boss!&#34;</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I probably was walking different, at that. There was a beautiful feeling of calm in my groin, a sense of</text>

<text top="857" left="15" width="246" height="19" font="3">know what I'm talking about.</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="678" height="19" font="3">&#34;Everything's all right, Del,&#34; I insisted. &#34;John Coffey had a nightmare, that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;He a gris-gris man!&#34; Delacroix said vehemently. There was a nestle of sweat-beads on his upper lip. He</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="654" height="19" font="3">hadn't seen much, just enough to scare him half to death. &#34;He a hoodoo man!&#34;</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="238" height="19" font="3">&#34;What makes you say that?&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Delacroix reached up and took the mouse in one hand. He cupped it in his palm and lifted it to his face.</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">From his pocket, Delacroix took out a pink fragment - one of those peppermint candies. He held it out,</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">but at first the mouse ignored it, stretching out its neck toward the man instead, sniffing at his breath the</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">way a person might sniff at a bouquet of flowers. Its little oildrop eyes slitted most of the way closed in</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">an expression that looked like ecstasy. Delacroix kissed its nose, and the mouse allowed its nose to be</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">kissed. Then it took the offered piece of candy and began to munch it. Delacroix looked at it a moment</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">longer, then looked at me. All at once I got it.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="367" height="19" font="3">&#34;The mouse told you,&#34; I said. &#34;Am I right?&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="54" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oui.&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="316" height="19" font="3">&#34;Like he whispered his name to you.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="257" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oui, in my ear he whisper it.&#34;</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lie down, Del,&#34; I said. &#34;Have you a little rest. All that whispering back and forth must wear you out.&#34;</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">He said something else-accused me of not believing him, I suppose. His voice seemed to be coming from</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">a long way off again. And when I went back up to the duty desk, I hardly seemed to be walking at all - it</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">was more like I was floating, or maybe not even moving, the cells just rolling past me on either side,</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="262" height="19" font="3">movie props on hidden wheels.</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I started to sit like normal, but halfway into it my knees unlocked and I dropped onto the blue cushion</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Harry had brought from home the year before and plopped onto the seat of the chair. If the chair hadn't</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">been there, I reckon I would have plopped straight to the floor without passing Go or collecting two</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="136" height="19" font="3">hundred dollars.</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">I sat there, feeling the nothing in my groin where a forest fire had been blazing not ten minutes before. <i>I</i></text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="4"><i>helped it, didn't</i> I? John Coffey had said, and that was true, as far as my body went. My peace of mind</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="484" height="19" font="3">was a different story, though. <i>That</i> he hadn't helped at all.</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">My eyes fell on the stack of forms under the tin ashtray we kept on the corner of the desk. BLOCK</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">REPORT was printed at the top, and about halfway down was a blank space headed <i>Report All Unusual</i></text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="4"><i>Occurrences.</i> I would use that space in tonight's report, telling the story of William Wharton's colorful</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">and action-packed arrival. But suppose I also told what had happened to me in John Coffey's cell? I saw</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">myself picking up the pencil - the one whose tip Brutal was always licking - and writing a single word in</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="255" height="19" font="3">big capital letters: MIRACLE.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">That should have been funny, but instead of smiling, all at once I felt sure that I was going to cry I put <i>my</i></text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">hands to my face, palms against my mouth to stifle the sobs - I didn't want to scare Del again just when</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">he was starting to get settled down - but no sobs came. No tears, either. After a few moments I lowered</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">my hands back to the desk and folded them. I didn't know what I was feeling, and the only clear thought</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">in my head was a wish that no one should come back onto the block until I was a little more in control of</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="462" height="19" font="3">myself. I was afraid of what they might see in my face.</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">I drew a Block Report form toward me. I would wait until I had settled down a bit more to write about</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">how my latest problem child had almost strangled Dean Stanton, but I could fill out the rest of the</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">boilerplate foolishness in the meantime. I thought my handwriting might look funny - trembly - but it</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="299" height="19" font="3">came out about the same as always.</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">About five minutes after I started, I put the pencil down and went into the W.C. adjacent to my office to</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">take a leak. I didn't need to go very bad, but I could manage enough to test what had happened to me, I</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">thought. As I stood there, waiting for my water to flow, I became sure that it would hurt just the way it</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">had that morning, as if I were passing tiny shards of broken glass; what he'd done to me would turn out to</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="605" height="19" font="3">be only hypnosis, after all, and that might be a relief in spite of the pain.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Except there was no pain, and what went into the bowl was clear, with no sign of pus. I buttoned my fly,</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="769" height="19" font="3">pulled the chain that flushed the commode, went back to the duty desk, and sat down again.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">I knew what had happened; I suppose I knew even when I was trying to tell myself I'd been hypnotized.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I'd experienced a healing, an authentic Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty. As a boy who'd grown up going</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">to whatever Baptist or Pentecostal church my mother and her sisters happened to be in favor of during</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">any given month, I had heard plenty of Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty miracle stories. I didn't believe</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">all of them, but there were plenty of people I did believe. One of these was a man named Roy Delfines,</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">who lived with his family about two miles down the road from us when I was six or so. Delfines had</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="794" height="19" font="3">chopped his son's little finger off with a hatchet, an accident which had occurred when the boy</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">unexpectedly moved his hand on a log he'd been holding on the backyard chopping block for his dad.</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Roy Delfines said he had practically worn out the carpet with his knees that fall and winter, and in the</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">spring the boy's finger had grown back. Even the nail had grown back. I believed Roy Delfines when he</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">testified at Thursday-night rejoicing. There was a naked, uncomplicated honesty in what he said as he</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">stood there talking with his hands jammed deep into the pockets of his biballs that was impossible not to</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">believe. &#34;It itch him some when thet finger started coming, kep him awake nights,&#34; Roy Delfines said,</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="719" height="19" font="3">&#34;but he knowed it was the Lord's itch and let it be.&#34; Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty.</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Roy Delfines's story was only one of many; I grew up in a tradition of miracles and healings. I grew up</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">believing in gris-gris, as well (only, up in the hills we said it to rhyme with <i>kiss-kiss):</i> stump-water for</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">warts, moss under your pillow to ease the heartache of lost love, and, of course, what we used to call</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="4"><i>haints - but I</i> did not believe John Coffey was a gris-gris man. I had looked into his eyes. More</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">important,' I had felt his touch. Being touched by him was like being touched by some strange and</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="150" height="19" font="3">wonderful doctor.</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="166" height="19" font="4"><i>I helped it, didn't I?</i></text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">That kept chiming in my head, like a snatch of song you can't get rid of, or words you'd speak to set a</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="45" height="19" font="3">spell.</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="166" height="19" font="4"><i>I helped it, didn't I?</i></text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Except <i>he</i> hadn't. God had. John Coffey's use of &#34;I&#34; could be chalked up to ignorance rather than pride,</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">but I knew - believed, at least - what I had learned about healing in those churches of Praise Jesus, The</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Lord Is Mighty, piney-woods amen corners much beloved by my twenty-two-year-old mother and my</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">aunts: that healing is never about the healed or the healer, but about God's will. For one to rejoice at the</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">sick made well is normal, quite the expected thing, but the person healed has an obligation to then ask</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">why - to meditate on God's will, and the extraordinary lengths to which God has gone to realize His will.</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">What did God want of me, in this case? What did He want badly enough to put healing power in the</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">hands of a child-murderer? To be on the block, instead of at home, sick as a dog, shivering in bed with</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the stink of sulfa running out of my pores? Perhaps; I was maybe supposed to be here instead of home in</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">case Wild Bill Wharton decided to kick up more dickens, or to make sure Percy Wetmore didn't get up to</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">some foolish and potentially destructive piece of fuckery All right, then. So be it. I would keep my eyes</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="489" height="19" font="3">open - and my mouth shut, especially about miracle cures.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">No one was apt to question my looking and sounding better; I'd been telling the world I was getting</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">better, and until that very day I'd honestly believed it. I had even told Warden Moores that I was on the</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">mend. Delacroix had seen something, but I thought he would keep his mouth shut, too (probably afraid</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">John Coffey would throw a spell on him if he didn't). As for Coffey himself, he'd probably already</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">forgotten it. He was nothing but a conduit, after all, and there isn't a culvert in the world that remembers</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">the water that flowed through it once the rain has stopped. So I resolved to keep my mouth completely</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">shut on the subject, with never an idea of how soon I'd be telling the story, or who I'd be telling it to.</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">But I was curious about my big boy, and there's no sense not admitting it. After what had happened to me</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="388" height="19" font="3">there in his cell, I was more curious than ever.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>4.</b></text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Before leaving that night, I arranged with Brutal to cover for me the next day, should I come in a little</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">late, and when I got up the following morning, I set out for Tefton, down in Trapingus County.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm not sure I like you worrying so much about this fellow Coffey,&#34; my wife said, handing me the lunch</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">she'd put up for me-Janice never believed in roadside hamburger stands; she used to say there was a</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="469" height="19" font="3">bellyache waiting in every one. &#34;It's not like you, Paul.&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="501" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm not worried about him,&#34; I said. &#34;I'm curious, that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;In my experience, one leads to the other,&#34; Janice said tartly, then gave me a good, hearty kiss on the</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">mouth. &#34;You look better, at least, I'll say that. For awhile there, you had me nervous. Waterworks all</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="91" height="19" font="3">cured up?&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;All cured up,&#34; I said, and off I went, singing songs like &#34;Come, Josephine, in My Flying Machine&#34; and</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="395" height="19" font="3">'We're in the Money&#34; to keep myself company.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">I went to the offices of the Tefton <i>Intelligencer</i> first, and they told me that Burt Hammersmith, the fellow</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">I was looking for, was most likely over at the county courthouse. At the courthouse they told me that</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Hammersmith had been there but had left when a burst waterpipe had closed down the main proceedings,</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">which happened to be a rape trial (in the pages of the <i>Intelligencer</i> the crime would be referred to as</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;assault on a woman,&#34; which was how such things were done in the days before Ricki Lake and Carnie</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Wilson came on the scene). They guessed he'd probably gone on home. I got some directions out a dirt</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">road so rutted and narrow I just about didn't dare take my Ford up it, and there I found my man.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Hammersmith had written most of the stories on the Coffey trial, and it was from him I found out most of</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">the details about the brief manhunt that had netted Coffey in the first place. The details the <i>Intelligencer</i></text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="498" height="19" font="3">considered too gruesome to print is what I mean, of course.</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Mrs. Hammersmith was a young woman with a tired, pretty face and hands red from lye soap. She didn't</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">ask my business, just led me through a small house fragrant with the smell of baking and onto the back</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">porch, where her husband sat with a bottle of pop in his hand and an unopened copy of <i>Liberty </i>magazine</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">on his lap. There was a small, sloping backyard; at the foot of it, two little ones were squabbling and</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">laughing over a swing. From the porch, it was impossible to tell their sexes, but I thought they were boy</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">and girl. Maybe even twins, which cast an interesting sort of light on their father's part, peripheral as it</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">had been, in the Coffey trial. Nearer at hand, set like an island in the middle of a turdstudded patch of</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">bare, beatup-looking ground, was a doghouse. No sign of Fido; it was another unseasonably hot day, and</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="369" height="19" font="3">I guessed he was probably inside, snoozing.</text>

<text top="83" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Allright,&#34; he said. He glanced at me, glanced at his wife, then looked back at his kids, which was where</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">his heart obviously lay. He was a thin man - almost painfully thin, as if he had just begun to recover from</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">a serious illness - and his hair had started to recede. His wife touched his shoulder tentatively with one of</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">her red, wash-swollen hands. He didn't look at it or reach up to touch it, and after a moment she took it</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">back. It occurred to me, fleetingly, that they looked more like brother and sister than husband and wife -</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="796" height="19" font="3">he'd gotten the brains, she'd gotten the looks, but neither of them had escaped some underlying</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">resemblance, a heredity that could never be escaped. Later, going home, I realized they didn't look alike</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">at all; what made them seem to was the aftermath of stress and the lingering of sorrow. It's strange how</text>
<text top="275" left="15" width="443" height="19" font="3">pain marks our faces, and makes us look like family.</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="386" height="19" font="3">She said, &#34;Yew-all want a cold drink, Mr. - ?&#34;</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's Edgecombe,&#34; I said. &#34;Paul Edgecombe. And thank you. A cold drink would be wonderful, ma'am.&#34;</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">She went back inside. I held out my hand to Hammersmith, who gave it a brief shake. His grip was limp</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="644" height="19" font="3">and cold. He never took his eyes off the kids down at the bottom of the yard.</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="741" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mr. Hammersmith, I'm E Block superintendent at Cold Mountain State Prison. That's-&#34;</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know what it is,&#34; he said, looking at me with a little more interest. &#34;So - the bull-goose screw of the</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Green Mile is standing on my back porch, just as big as life. What brings you fifty miles to talk to the</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="296" height="19" font="3">local rag's only full-time reporter?&#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="182" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">I think I expected some sort of strong reaction (the kids who could have been twins working at the back</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">of my mind - and perhaps the doghouse, too; the Dettericks had had a dog), but Hammersmith only</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">raised his eyebrows and sipped at his drink. &#34;Coffey's your problem now, isn't he?&#34; Hammersmith asked.</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's not much of a problem,&#34; I said. &#34;He doesn't like the dark, and he cries a lot of the time, but neither</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="570" height="19" font="3">thing makes much of a problem in our line of work. We see worse.&#34;</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;Cries a lot, does he?&#34; Hammersmith asked. &#34;Well, he's got a lot to cry about, I'd say. Considering what</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="308" height="19" font="3">he did. What do you want to know?&#34;</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Anything you can tell me. I've read your newspaper stories, so I guess what I want is anything that</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="135" height="19" font="3">wasn't in them.&#34;</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">He gave me a sharp, dry look. &#34;Like how the little girls looked? Like exactly what he did to them?&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">&#34;That the kind of stuff you're interested in, Mr. Edgecombe?&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; I said, keeping my voice mild. &#34;It's not the Detterick girls I'm interested in, sir. Poor little mites are</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="514" height="19" font="3">dead. But Coffey's not - not yet - and I'm curious about him.&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; he said. &#34;Pull up a chair and sit, Mr. Edgecombe. You'll forgive me if I sounded a little sharp</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">just now, but I get to see plenty of vultures in my line of work. Hell, I've been accused of being one of</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="514" height="19" font="3">em often enough, myself. I just wanted to make sure of you.&#34;</text>

<page number="79" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="130" height="19" font="3">&#34;And are you?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure enough, I guess,&#34; he said, sounding almost indifferent. The story he told me is pretty much the one</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">I set down earlier in this account - how Mrs. Detterick found the porch empty, with the screen door</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">pulled off its upper hinge, the blankets cast into one corner, and blood on the steps; how her son and</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">husband had taken after the girls' abductor; how the posse had caught up to them first and to John Coffey</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">not much later. How Coffey had been sitting on the riverbank and wailing, with the bodies curled in his</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">massive arms like big dolls. The reporter, rack-thin in his open-collared white shirt and gray town pants,</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">spoke in a low, unemotional voice - but his eyes never left his own two children as they squabbled and</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">laughed and took turns with the swing down there in the shade at the foot of the slope. Sometime in the</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">middle of the story, Mrs. Hammersmith came back with a bottle of homemade root beer, cold and strong</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">and delicious. She stood listening for awhile, then interrupted long enough to call down to the kids and</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">tell them to come up directly, she had cookies due out of the oven. &#34;We will, Mamma!&#34; called a little</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="433" height="19" font="3">girl's voice, and the woman went back inside again.</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">When Hammersmith had finished, he said: &#34;So why do you want to know? I never had me a visit from a</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="304" height="19" font="3">Big House screw before, it's a first.&#34;</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="116" height="19" font="3">&#34;I told you - &#34;</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">&#34;Curiosity, yep. Folks get curious, I know it, I even thank God for it, I'd be out of a job and might</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">actually have to go to work for a living without it. But fifty miles is a long way to come to satisfy simple</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="796" height="19" font="3">curiosity, especially when the last twenty is over bad roads. So why don't you tell me the truth,</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="476" height="19" font="3">Edgecombe? I satisfied yours, so now you satisfy mine.&#34;</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="4"><i>Well,</i> I could say, I <i>had this urinary infection, and John Coffey put his hands on me and healed it. The</i></text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="4"><i>man who raped and murdered those two little girls did that. So I wondered about him, of course - anyone</i></text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="4"><i>would. I even wondered if maybe Homer Cribus and Deputy Rob McGee didn't maybe collar the wrong</i></text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="4"><i>man. In spite of all the evidence against him I wonder that. Because a man who has a power like that in</i></text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="4"><i>his hands, you don't usually think of him as the kind of man who rapes and murders children.</i></text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="238" height="19" font="3">No, maybe that wouldn't do.</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;There are two things I've wondered about,&#34; I said. &#34;The first is if he ever did anything like that before.&#34;</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Hammersmith turned to me, his eyes suddenly sharp and bright with interest, and I saw he was a smart</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">fellow. Maybe even a brilliant fellow, in a quiet way. &#34;Why?&#34; he asked. &#34;What do you know,</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="274" height="19" font="3">Edgecombe? What has he said?&#34;</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing. But a man who does this sort of thing once has usually done it before. They get a taste for it.&#34;</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="380" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; he said. &#34;They do. They certainly do.&#34;</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;And it occurred to me that it would be easy enough to follow his backtrail and find out. A man his size,</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="402" height="19" font="3">and a Negro to boot, can't be that hard to trace.&#34;</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="695" height="19" font="3">&#34;You'd think so, but you'd be wrong,&#34; he said. &#34;In Coffey's case, anyhow. I know.&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="106" height="19" font="3">&#34;You tried?&#34;</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;I did, and came up all but empty. There were a couple of railroad fellows who thought they saw him in</text>
</page>
<page number="80" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">the Knoxville yards two days before the Detterick girls were killed. No surprise there; he was just across</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">the river from the Great Southern tracks when they collared him, and that's probably how he came down</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">here from Tennessee. I got a letter from a man who said he'd hired a big bald black man to shift crates for</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">him in the early spring of this year - this as in Kentucky. I sent him a picture of Coffey and he said that</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="672" height="19" font="3">was the man. But other than that -&#34; Hammersmith shrugged and shook his head.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">&#34;Doesn't that strike you as a little odd?&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;Strikes me as a <i>lot</i> odd, Mr. Edgecombe. It's like he dropped out of the sky. And he's no help; he can't</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="372" height="19" font="3">remember last week once this week comes.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="398" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, he can't,&#34; I said. &#34;How do you explain it?&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;We're in a Depression,&#34; he said, <i>&#34;that's</i> how I explain it. People all over the roads. The Okies want to</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">pick peaches in California, the poor whites from up in the brakes want to build cars in Detroit, the black</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">folks from Mississippi want to go up to New England and work in the shoe factories or the textile mills.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">Everyone - black as well as white - thinks it's going to be better over the next jump of land. It's the</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">American damn way. Even a giant like Coffey doesn't get noticed everywhere he goes - until, that is, he</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="466" height="19" font="3">decides to kill a couple of little girls. Little <i>white</i> girls.&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="262" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do you believe that?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">He gave me a bland look from his too-thin face. &#34;Sometimes I do,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">His wife leaned out of the kitchen window like an engineer from the cab of a locomotive and called,</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="780" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Kids! Cookies are ready!&#34;</i> She turned to me. &#34;Would you like an oatmeal-raisin cookie, Mr.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="117" height="19" font="3">Edgecombe?&#34;</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="537" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm sure they're delicious, ma'am, but I'll take a pass this time.&#34;</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="437" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; she said, and drew her head back inside.</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;Have you seen the scars on him?&#34; Hammersmith asked abruptly. He was still watching his kids, who</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">couldn't quite bring themselves to abandon the pleasures of the swing - not even for oatmeal-raisin</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="69" height="19" font="3">cookies.</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="289" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes.&#34; But I was surprised he had.</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">He saw my reaction and laughed. &#34;The defense attorney's one big victory was getting Coffey to take off</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">his shirt and show those scars to the jury. The prosecutor, George Peterson, objected like hell, but the</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">judge allowed it. Old George could have saved, his breath - juries around these parts don't buy all that</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">psychology crap about how people who've been mistreated just can't help themselves. They believe</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">people <i>can</i> help themselves. It's a point of view I have a lot of sympathy for - but those scars were pretty</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">ghastly, just the same. Notice anything about them, Edgecombe?&#34;</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">I had seen the man naked in the shower, and I'd noticed, all right; I knew just what he was talking about.</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="348" height="19" font="3">&#34;They're all broken up. Latticed, almost.&#34;</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="256" height="19" font="3">&#34;You know what that means?&#34;</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">&#34;Somebody whopped the living hell out of him when he was a kid,&#34; I said. &#34;Before he grew.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="81" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;But they didn't manage to whop the devil out of him, did they, Edgecombe? Should have spared the rod</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="585" height="19" font="3">and just drowned him in the river like a stray kitten, don't you think?&#34;</text>
<text top="101" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I suppose it would have been politic to simply agree and get out of there, but I couldn't. I'd seen him. And</text>
<text top="125" left="15" width="399" height="19" font="3">I'd <i>felt</i> him, as well. Felt the touch of his hands.</text>
<text top="164" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's ... strange,&#34; I said. &#34;But there doesn't seem to be any real violence in him. I know how he was</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">found, and it's hard to jibe that with what I see, day in and day out, on the block. I know violent men, Mr.</text>
<text top="212" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Hammersmith.&#34; It was Wharton I was thinking about, of course, Wharton strangling Dean Stanton with</text>
<text top="236" left="15" width="590" height="19" font="3">his wrist-chain and bellowing <i>Whoooee, boys! Ain't this a party, now?</i></text>
<text top="275" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">He was looking at me closely now, and smiling a little, incredulous smile that I didn't care for very much.</text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;You didn't come up here to get an idea about whether or not he might have killed some other little girls</text>
<text top="323" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">somewhere else,&#34; he said. &#34;You came up here to see if I think he did it at all. That's it, isn't it? 'Fess up,</text>
<text top="347" left="15" width="113" height="19" font="3">Edgecombe.&#34;</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">I swallowed the last of my cold drink, put the bottle down on the little table, and said: &#34;Well? Do you?&#34;</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Kids!&#34; he called down the hill, leaning forward a little in his chair to do it. <i>&#34;Y'all come on up here now n</i></text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="4"><i>get your cookies!&#34;</i> Then he leaned back in his chair again and looked at me. That little smile - the one I</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="319" height="19" font="3">didn't much care for - had reappeared.</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Tell you something,&#34; he said. &#34;You want to listen close, too, because this might just be something you</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="127" height="19" font="3">need to know.&#34;</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="127" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm listening.&#34;</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;We had us a dog named Sir Galahad,&#34; he said, and cocked a thumb at the doghouse. &#34;A good dog. No</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">particular breed, but gentle. Calm. Ready to lick your hand or fetch a stick. There are plenty of mongrel</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="285" height="19" font="3">dogs like him, wouldn't you say?&#34;</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="167" height="19" font="3">I shrugged, nodded.</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;In many ways, a good mongrel dog is like your negro,&#34; he said. &#34;You get to know it, and often you grow</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">to love it. It is of no particular use, but you keep it around because you <i>think</i> it loves you. If you're lucky,</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Mr. Edgecombe, you never have to find out any different. Cynthia and I, we were not lucky.&#34; He sighed -</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">a long and somehow skeletal sound, like the wind rummaging through fallen leaves. He pointed toward</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">the doghouse again, and I wondered how I had missed its general air of abandonment earlier, or the fact</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="570" height="19" font="3">that many of the turds had grown whitish and powdery at their tops.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;I used to clean up after him,&#34; Hammersmith said, &#34;and keep the roof of his house repaired against the</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">rain. In that way also Sir Galahad was like your Southern negro, who will not do those things for himself.</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Now I don't touch it, I haven't been near it since the accident - if you can call it an accident. I went over</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">there with my rifle and shot him, but I haven't been over there since. I can't bring myself to. I suppose I</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="527" height="19" font="3">will, in time. I'll clean up his messes and tear down his house.&#34;</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Here came the kids, and all at once I didn't want them to come; all at once that was the last thing on earth</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="421" height="19" font="3">I wanted. The little girl was all right, but the boy -</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="747" height="19" font="3">They pounded up the steps, looked at me, giggled, then went on toward the kitchen door.</text>
</page>
<page number="82" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="511" height="19" font="3">&#34;Caleb,&#34; Hammersmith said. &#34;Come here. Just for a second.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">The little girl - surely his twin, they had to be of an age - went on into the kitchen. The little boy came to</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">his father, looking down at his feet. He knew he was ugly. He was only four, I guess, but four is old</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">enough to know that you're ugly. His father put two fingers under the boy's chin and tried to raise his</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">face. At first the boy resisted, but when his father said &#34;Please, son,&#34; in tones of sweetness and calmness</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="278" height="19" font="3">and love, he did as he was asked.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">A huge, circular scar ran out of his hair, down his forehead, through one dead and indifferently cocked</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">eye, and to the comer of his mouth, which had been disfigured into the knowing leer of a gambler or</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">perhaps a whoremaster. One cheek was smooth and pretty; the other was bunched up like the stump of a</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="593" height="19" font="3">tree. I guessed there had been a hole in it, but that, at least, had healed.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;He has the one eye,&#34; Hammersmith said, caressing the boy's bunched cheek with a lover's kind fingers.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;I suppose he's lucky not to be blind. We get down on our knees and thank God for that much, at least.</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="101" height="19" font="3">Eh, Caleb?&#34;</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; the boy said shyly - the boy who would be beaten mercilessly on the play-yard by laughing,</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">jeering bullies for all his miserable years of education, the boy who would never be asked to play Spin</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">the Bottle or Post Office and would probably never sleep with a woman not bought and paid for once he</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">was grown to manhood's times and needs, the boy who would always stand outside the warm and lighted</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">circle of his peers, the boy who would look at himself in his mirror for the next fifty or sixty or seventy</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="354" height="19" font="3">years of his life and think <i>ugly, ugly, ugly.</i></text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go on in and get your cookies,&#34; his father said, and kissed his son's sneering mouth.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Caleb, said, and dashed inside.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Hammersmith took a handkerchief from his back pocket and wiped at his eyes with it - they were dry,</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="414" height="19" font="3">but I suppose he'd gotten used to them being wet.</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">&#34;The dog was here when they were born,&#34; he said. &#34;I brought him in the house to smell them when</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Cynthia brought them home from the hospital, and Sir Galahad licked their hands. Their little hands.&#34; He</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">nodded, as if confirming this to himself. &#34;He played with them; used to lick Arden's face until she</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">giggled. Caleb used to pull his ears, and when he was first learning to walk, he'd sometimes go around</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="792" height="19" font="3">the yard, holding to Galahad's tail. The dog never so much as <i>growled</i> at him. Either of them.&#34;</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">Now the tears were coming; he wiped at them automatically, as a man does when he's had lots of</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="72" height="19" font="3">practice.</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;There was no reason,&#34; he said. &#34;Caleb didn't hurt him, yell at him, anything. I know. I was there. If I</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">hadn't have been, the boy would almost certainly have been killed. What happened, Mr. Edgecombe, was</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="4"><i>nothing.</i> The boy just got his face set the right way in front of the dog's face, and it came into Sir</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Galahad's mind - whatever serves a dog for a mind - to lunge and bite. To kill, if he could. The boy was</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">there in front of him and the dog bit. And that's what happened with Coffey. He was there, he saw them</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">on the porch, he took them, he raped them, he killed them. You say there should be some hint that he did</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">something like it before, and I know what you mean, but maybe he <i>didn't </i>do it before. My dog never bit</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">before; just that once. Maybe, if Coffey was let go, he'd never do it again. Maybe my dog never would</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">have bit again. But I didn't concern myself with that, you know. I went out with my rifle and grabbed his</text>

<page number="83" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">collar and blew his head off.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="195" height="19" font="3">He was breathing hard.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm as enlightened as the next man, Mr. Edgecombe, went to college in Bowling Green, took history as</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">well as journalism, some philosophy, too. I like to think of myself as enlightened. I don't suppose folks</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">up North would, but I like to think of myself as enlightened. I'd not bring slavery back for all the tea in</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">China. I think we have to be humane and generous in our efforts to solve the race problem. But we have</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">to remember that your negro will bite if he gets the chance, just like a mongrel dog will bite if he gets the</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">chance and it crosses his mind to do so. You want to know if he did it, your weepy Mr. Coffey with the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="167" height="19" font="3">scars all over him?&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">I nodded.</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, yes,&#34; Hammersmith said. &#34;He did it. Don't you doubt it, and don't you turn your back on him. You</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">might get away with it once or a hundred times ... even a thousand ... but in the end -&#34; He raised a hand</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">before my eyes and snapped the fingers together rapidly against the thumb, turning the hand into a biting</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="224" height="19" font="3">mouth. &#34;You understand?&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="130" height="19" font="3">I nodded again.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;He raped them, he killed them, and afterward he was sorry - but those little girls stayed raped, those</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">little girls stayed dead. But you'll fix him, won't you, Edgecombe? In a few weeks you'll fix him so he</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">never does anything like that again.&#34; He got up, went to the porch rail, and looked vaguely at the</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">doghouse, standing at the center of its beaten patch, in the middle of those aging turds. &#34;Perhaps you'll</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">excuse me,&#34; he said. &#34;Since I don't have to spend the afternoon in court, I thought I might visit with my</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="513" height="19" font="3">family for a little bit. A man's children are only young once.&#34;</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="723" height="19" font="3">&#34;You go ahead,&#34; I said. My lips felt numb and distant. &#34;And thank you for your time.&#34;</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="229" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't mention it,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">I drove directly from Hammersmith's house to the prison. It was a long drive, and this time I wasn't able</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">to shorten it by singing songs. It felt like all the songs had gone out of me, at least for awhile. I kept</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">seeing that poor little boy's disfigured face. And Hammersmith's hand, the fingers going up and down</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="310" height="19" font="3">against the thumb in a biting motion.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>5.</b></text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Wild Bill Wharton took his first trip down to the restraint room the very next day. He spent the morning</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">and afternoon being as quiet and good as Mary's little lamb, a state we soon discovered was not natural to</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">him, and meant trouble. Then, around seven-thirty that evening, Harry felt something warm splash on the</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">cuffs of uniform pants he had put on clean just that day. It was piss. William Wharton was standing at his</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">cell, showing his darkening teeth in a wide grin, and pissing all over Harry Terwilliger's pants and shoes.</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;The dirty sonofabitch must have been saving it up all day,&#34; Harry said later, still disgusted and outraged.</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Well, that was it. It was time to show William Wharton who ran the show on E Block. Harry got Brutal</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">and me, and I alerted Dean and Percy, who were also on. We had three prisoners by then, remember, and</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">were into what we called full coverage, with my group on from seven in the evening to three in the</text>
</page>
<page number="84" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">morning - when trouble was most apt to break out - and two other crews covering the rest of the day.</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Those other crews consisted mostly of floaters, with Bill Dodge usually in charge. It wasn't a bad way to</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">run things, all and all, and I felt that, once I could shift Percy over to days, life would be even better. I</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">never got around to that, however. I sometimes wonder if it would have changed things, if I had.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Anyway, there was a big watermain in the storage room, on the side away from Old Sparky, and Dean</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">and Percy hooked up a length of canvas firehose to it. Then they stood by the valve that would open it, if</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="65" height="19" font="3">needed.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Brutal and I hurried down to Wharton's cell, where Wharton still stood, still grinning and still with his</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">tool hanging out of his pants. I had liberated the straitjacket from the restraint room and tossed it on a</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">shelf in my office last thing before going home the night before, thinking we might be needing it for our</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">new problem child. Now I had it in one hand, my index finger hooked under one of the canvas straps.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Harry came behind us, hauling the nozzle of the firehose, which ran back through my office, down the</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">storage-room steps, and to the drum where Dean and Percy were paying it out as fast as they could.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey, d'jall like that?&#34; Wild Bill asked. He was laughing like a kid at a carnival, laughing so hard he</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">could barely talk; big tears went rolling down his cheeks. &#34;You come on s'fast I guess you must've. I'm</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="806" height="19" font="3">currently cookin some turds to go with it. Nice soft ones. I'll have them out to y'all tomorrow - &#34;</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">He saw that I was unlocking his cell door and his eyes narrowed. He saw that Brutal was holding his</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="693" height="19" font="3">revolver in one hand and his nightstick in the other, and they narrowed even more.</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;You can come in here on your legs, but you'll go out on your backs, Billy the Kid is goan guarantee you</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">that,&#34; he told us. His eyes shifted back to me. &#34;And if you think you're gonna put that nut-coat on me,</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="342" height="19" font="3">you got another think coming, old hoss.&#34;</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're not the one who says go or jump back around here,&#34; I told him. &#34;You should know that, but I</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="513" height="19" font="3">guess you're too dumb to pick it up without a little teaching.&#34;</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">I finished unlocking the door and ran it back on its track. Wharton retreated to the bunk, his cock still</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">hanging out of his pants, put his hands out to me, palms up, then beckoned with his fingers. &#34;Come on,</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">you ugly motherfucker,&#34; he said. &#34;They be schoolin, all right, but this old boy's well set up to be the</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">teacher.&#34; He shifted his gaze and his darktoothed grin to Brutal. &#34;Come on, big fella, you first. This time</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">you cain't sneak up behind me. Put down that gun - you ain't gonna shoot it anyway, not you - and we'll</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">go man-to-man. See who's the better fel-&#34;</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Brutal stepped into the cell, but not toward Wharton. He moved to the left once he was through the door,</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">and Wharton's narrow eyes widened as he saw the firehose pointed at him.</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="345" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, you don't,&#34; he said. &#34;Oh no, you d-&#34;</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="366" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dean!&#34; I yelled. &#34;Turn it on! All the way!&#34;</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Wharton jumped forward, and Brutal hit him a good smart lick - the kind of lick I'm sure Percy dreamed</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">of - across his forehead, laying his baton right over Wharton's eyebrows. Wharton, who seemed to think</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">we'd never seen trouble until we'd seen him, went to his knees, his eyes open but blind. Then the water</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">came, Harry staggering back a step under its power and then holding steady, the nozzle firm in his hands,</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">pointed like a gun. The stream caught Wild Bill Wharton square in the middle of his chest, spun him</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">halfway around, and drove him back under his bunk. Down the hall, Delacroix was jumping from foot to</text>
</page>
<page number="85" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">foot, cackling shrilly, and cursing at John Coffey, demanding that Coffey tell him what was going on,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">who was winning, and how dat gran' fou new boy like dat Chinee water treatment. John said nothing, just</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">stood there quietly in his too-short pants and his prison slippers. I only had one quick glance at him, but</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">that was enough to observe his same old expression, both sad and serene. It was as if he'd seen the whole</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="477" height="19" font="3">thing before, not just once or twice but a thousand times.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;Kill the water!&#34; Brutal shouted back over his shoulder, then raced forward into the cell. He sank his</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">hands into the semi-conscious Wharton's armpits and dragged him out from under his bunk. Wharton was</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">coughing and making a glub-glub sound. Blood was dribbling into his dazed eyes from above his brows,</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="464" height="19" font="3">where Brutal's stick had popped the skin open in a line.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">We had the straitjacket business down to a science, did Brutus Howell and me; we'd practiced it like a</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">couple of vaudeville hoofers working up a new dance routine. Every now and then, that practice paid off.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">Now, for instance. Brutal sat Wharton up and held out his arms toward me the way a kid might hold out</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">the arms of a Raggedy Andy doll. Awareness was just starting to seep back into Wharton's eyes, the</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">knowledge that if he didn't start fighting right away, it was going to be too late, but the lines were still</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">down between his brain and his muscles, and before he could repair them, I had rammed the sleeves of</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">the coat up his arms and Brutal was doing the buckles up the back. While he took care of that, I grabbed</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">the cuff-straps, pulled Wharton's arms around his sides, and linked his wrists together with another</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="537" height="19" font="3">canvas strap. He ended up looking like he was hugging himself.</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Goddam you, big dummy, how dey doin widdim?&#34; Delacroix screamed. I heard Mr. Jingles squeaking,</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="243" height="19" font="3">as if he wanted to know, too.</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Percy arrived, his shirt wet and sticking to him from his struggles with the watermain, his face glowing</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">with excitement. Dean came along behind him, wearing a bracelet of purplish bruise around his throat</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="250" height="19" font="3">and looking a lot less thrilled.</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="753" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, now, Wild Bill,&#34; I said, and yanked Wharton to his feet. &#34;Little walky-walky.&#34;</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Don't you call me that!&#34;</i> Wharton screamed shrilly, and I think that for the first time we were seeing real</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">feelings, and not just a clever animal's camouflage spots. &#34;Wild Bill Hickok wasn't no range-rider! He</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">never fought him no bear with a Bowie knife, either! He was just another bushwhackin John Law! Dumb</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="552" height="19" font="3">sonofabitch sat with his back to the door and got kilt by a drunk!&#34;</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh my suds and body, a <i>history lesson!&#34;</i> Brutal exclaimed, and shoved Wharton out of his cell. &#34;A feller</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">just never knows what he's going to get when he clocks in here, only that it's apt to be nice. But with so</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">many nice people like you around, I guess that kind of stands to reason, don't it? And you know what?</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Pretty soon you'll be history yourself, Wild Bill. Meantime, you get on down the hall. We got a room for</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="284" height="19" font="3">you. Kind of a cooling-off room.&#34;</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Wharton gave a furious, inarticulate scream and threw himself at Brutal, even though he was snugly</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">buckled into the coat now, and his arms were wrapped around behind him. Percy made to draw his baton</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">- the Wetmore Solution for all of life's problems - and Dean put a hand on his wrist. Percy gave him a</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">puzzled, half-indignant look, as if to say that after what Wharton had done to Dean, Dean should be the</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="417" height="19" font="3">last person in the world to want to hold him back.</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Brutal pushed Wharton backward. I caught him and pushed him to Harry. And Harry propelled him on</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">down the Green Mile, past the gleeful Delacroix and the impassive Coffey. Wharton ran to keep from</text>
</page>
<page number="86" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">falling on his face, spitting curses the whole way. Spitting them the way a welder's torch spits sparks. We</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">banged him into the last cell on the right while Dean, Harry, and Percy (who for once wasn't complaining</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">about being unfairly overworked) yanked all of the crap out of the restraint room. While they did that, I</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="329" height="19" font="3">had a brief conversation with Wharton.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">&#34;You think you're tough,&#34; I said, &#34;and maybe you are, sonny, but in here tough don't matter. Your</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">stampeding days are over. If you take it easy on us, we'll take it easy on you. If you make it hard, you'll</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="673" height="19" font="3">die in the end just the same, only we'll sharpen you like a pencil before you go.&#34;</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're gonna be so happy to see the end of me,&#34; Wharton said in a hoarse voice. He was struggling</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">against the straitjacket even though he must have known it would do no good, and his face was as red as</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">a tomato. &#34;And until I'm gone, I'll make your lives miserable.&#34; He bared his teeth at me like an angry</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="67" height="19" font="3">baboon.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">&#34;If that's all you want, to make our lives miserable, you can quit now, because you've already</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">succeeded,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;But as far as your time on the Mile goes, Wharton, we don't care if you spend</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">all of it in the room with the soft walls. And you can wear that damned nut-coat until your arms gangrene</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">from lack of circulation and fall right off.&#34; He paused. &#34;No one much comes down here, you know. And</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">if you think anyone gives much of a shit what happens to you, one way or another, you best reconsider.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="483" height="19" font="3">To the world in general, you're already one dead outlaw.&#34;</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Wharton was studying Brutal carefully, and the color was fading out of his face. &#34;Lemme out of it&#34;, he</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">said in a placatory voice - a voice too sane and too reasonable to trust. &#34;I'll be good. Honest Injun.&#34;</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">Harry appeared in the cell doorway. The end of the corridor looked like a rummage sale, but we'd set</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">things to rights with good speed once we got started. We had before; we knew the drill. &#34;All ready,&#34;</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="93" height="19" font="3">Harry said.</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">Brutal grabbed the bulge in the canvas where Wharton's right elbow was and yanked him to his feet.</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, Wild Billy. And look on the good side. You're gonna have at least twenty-four hours to</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">remind yourself never to sit with your back to the door, and to never hold onto no aces and eights.&#34;</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lemme out of it,&#34; Wharton said. He looked from Brutal to Harry to me, the red creeping back into his</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="705" height="19" font="3">face. &#34;I'll be good - I tell you I've learned my lesson. <i>I ... I ... ummmmmahhhhhhh-!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">He suddenly collapsed, half of him in the cell, half of him on the played-out lino of the Green Mile,</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="320" height="19" font="3">kicking his feet and bucking his body.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">&#34;Holy Christ, he's pitchin a fit,&#34; Percy whispered.</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure, and my sister's the Whore of Babylon,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;She dances the hootchie-kootchie for Moses</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">on Saturday nights in a long white veil.&#34; He bent down and hooked a hand into one of Wharton's armpits.</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">I got the other one. Wharton threshed between us like a hooked fish. Carrying his jerking body, listening</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">to him grunt from one end and fart from the other was one of my life's less pleasant experiences.</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">I looked up and met John Coffey's eyes for a second. They were bloodshot, and his dark cheeks were</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">wet. He had been crying again. I thought of Hammersmith making that biting gesture with his hand and</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">shivered a little. Then I turned my attention back to Wharton.</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">We threw him into the restraint room like he was cargo, and watched him lie on the floor, bucking hard</text>
</page>
<page number="87" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">in the straitjacket next to the drain we had once checked for the mouse which had started its E Block life</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="170" height="19" font="3">as Steamboat Willy.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't much care if he swallows his tongue or something and dies,&#34; Dean said in his hoarse and raspy</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">voice, &#34;but think of the paperwork, boys! It'd never end.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;Never mind the paperwork, think of the hearing,&#34; Harry said gloomily. &#34;We'd lose our damned jobs.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">End up picking peas down Mississippi. You know what Mississippi is, don't you? It's the Indian word for</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">asshole.&#34;</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;He ain't gonna die, and he ain't gonna swallow his tongue, either,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;When we open this door</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="474" height="19" font="3">tomorrow, he's gonna be just fine. Take my word for it.&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">That's the way it was, too. The man we took back to his cell the next night at nine was quiet, pallid, and</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">seemingly chastened. He walked with his head down, made no effort to attack anyone when the</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">straitjacket came off, and only stared listlessly at me when I told him it would go just the same the next</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">time, and he just had to ask himself how much time he wanted to spend pissing in his pants and eating</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="262" height="19" font="3">baby-food a spoonful at a time.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll be good, boss, I learnt my lesson,&#34; he whispered in a humble little voice as we put him back in his</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="315" height="19" font="3">cell. Brutal looked at me and winked.</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">Late the next day, William Wharton, who was Billy the Kid to himself and never that bushwhacking</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">John Law Wild Bill Hickok, bought a moon-pie from Old Toot-Toot. Wharton had been expressly</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">forbidden any such commerce, but the afternoon crew was composed of floaters, as I think I have said,</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">and the deal went down. Toot himself undoubtedly knew better, but to him the snack-wagon was always</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">a case of a nickel is a nickel, a dime is a dime, I'd sing another chorus but I don't have the time.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">That night, when Brutal ran his check-round, Wharton was standing at the door of his cell. He waited</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">until Brutal looked up at him, then slammed the heels of his hands into his bulging cheeks and shot a</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">thick and amazingly long stream of chocolate sludge into Brutal's face. He had crammed the entire</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="769" height="19" font="3">moon-pie into his trap, held it there until it liquefied, and then used it like chewing tobacco.</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Wharton fell back on his bunk wearing a chocolate goatee, kicking his legs and screaming with laughter</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">and pointing to Brutal, who was wearing a lot more than a goatee. &#34;Li'l Black Sambo, yassuh, boss,</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">yassuh, howdoo you do?&#34; Wharton held his belly and howled. &#34;Gosh, if it had only been ka-ka! I wish it</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">had been! If I'd had me some of that---&#34;</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;You are ka-ka,&#34; Brutal growled, &#34;and I hope you got your bags packed, because you're going back down</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="193" height="19" font="3">to your favorite toilet.&#34;</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Once again Wharton was bundled into the strait jacket, and once again we stowed him in the room with</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">the soft walls. Two days, this time. Sometimes we could hear him raving in there, sometimes we could</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">hear him promising that he'd be good, that he'd come to his senses and be good, and sometimes we could</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">hear him screaming that he needed a doctor, that he was dying. Mostly, though, he was silent. And he</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">was silent when we took him out again, too, walking, back to his cell with his head down and his eyes</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">dull, not responding when Harry said, &#34;Remember, it's up to you.&#34; He would be all right for a while, and</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">then he'd try something else. There was nothing he did that hadn't been tried before (well, except for the</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">thing with the moon-pie, maybe; even Brutal admitted that was pretty original), but his sheer persistence</text>

<page number="88" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">was scary. I was afraid that sooner or later someone's attention might lapse and there would be hell to</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">pay. And the situation might continue for quite awhile, because somewhere he had a lawyer who was</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">beating the bushes, telling folks how wrong it would be to kill this fellow upon whose brow the dew of</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">youth had not yet dried - and who was, incidentally, as white as old Jeff Davis. There was no sense</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">complaining about it, because keeping Wharton out of the chair was his lawyer's job. Keeping him safely</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">jugged was ours. And in the end, Old Sparky would almost certainly have him, lawyer or no lawyer.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>6.</b></text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">That was the week Melinda Moores, the warden's wife, came home from Indianola. The doctors were</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">done with her; they had their interesting, newfangled X-ray photographs of the tumor in her head; they</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">had documented the weakness in her hand and the paralyzing pains that racked her almost constantly by</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">then, and were done with her. They gave her husband a bunch of pills with morphine in them and sent</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Melinda home to die. Hal Moores had some sick-leave piled up - not a lot, they didn't give you a lot in</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="668" height="19" font="3">those days, but he took what he had so he could help her do what she had to do.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">My wife and I went to see her three days or so after she came home. I called ahead and Hal said yes, that</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">would be fine, Melinda was having a pretty good day and would enjoy seeing us.</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;I hate calls like this,&#34; I said to Janice as we drove to the little house where the Mooreses had spent most</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="146" height="19" font="3">of their marriage.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;So does everyone, honey,&#34; she said, and patted my hand. &#34;We'll bear up under it, and so will she.&#34;</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="99" height="19" font="3">&#34;I hope so.&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">We found Melinda in the sitting room, planted in a bright slant of unseasonably warm October sun, and</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">my first shocked thought was that she had lost ninety pounds. She hadn't, of course - if she'd lost that</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">much weight, she hardly would have been there at all - but that was my brain's initial reaction to what my</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">eyes were reporting. Her face had fallen away to show the shape of the underlying skull, and her skin</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">was as white as parchment. There were dark circles under her eyes. And it was the first time I ever saw</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">her in her rocker when she didn't have a lapful of sewing or afghan squares or rags for braiding into a</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="521" height="19" font="3">rug. She was just sitting there. Like a person in a train-station.</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;Melinda,&#34; my wife said warmly. I think she was as shocked as I was - more, perhaps - but she hid it</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">splendidly, as some women seem able to do. She went to Melinda, dropped on one knee beside the</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">rocking chair in which the warden's wife sat, and took one of her hands. As she did, my eye happened on</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">the blue hearthrug by the fireplace. It occurred to me that it should have been the shade of tired old limes,</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="562" height="19" font="3">because now this room was just another version of the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;I brought you some tea,&#34; Jan said, &#34;the kind I put up myself. It's a nice sleepy tea. I've left it in the</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">kitchen.&#34;</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="645" height="19" font="3">&#34;Thank you so much, darlin,&#34; Melinda said. Her voice sounded old and rusty</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="347" height="19" font="3">&#34;How you feeling, dear?&#34; my wife asked.</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;Better,&#34; Melinda said in her rusty, grating voice. &#34;Not so's I want to go out to a barn dance, but at least</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="795" height="19" font="3">there's no pain today. They give me some pills for the headaches. Sometimes they even work.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="89" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="186" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's good, isn't it?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;But I can't grip so well. Something's happened ... to my hand.&#34; She raised it, looked at it as if she had</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">never seen it before, then lowered it back into her lap. &#34;Something's happened ... all over me.&#34; She began</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">to cry in a soundless way that made me think of John Coffey. It started to chime in my head again, that</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">thing he'd said: I <i>helped it, didn't I? I helped it, didn't</i> I? Like a rhyme you can't get rid of.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Hal came in then. He collared me, and you can believe me when I say I was glad to be collared. We went</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">into the kitchen, and he poured me half a shot of white whiskey, hot stuff fresh out of some countryman's</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">still. We clinked our glasses together and drank. The shine went down like coal-oil, but the bloom in the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">belly was heaven. Still, when Moores tipped the mason jar at me, wordlessly asking if I wanted the other</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">half, I shook my head and waved it off. Wild Bill Wharton was out of restraints - for the time being,</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">anyway - and it wouldn't be safe to go near where he was with a booze-clouded head. Not even with bars</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="99" height="19" font="3">between us.</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know how long I can take this, Paul,&#34; he said in a low voice. &#34;There's a girl who comes in</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">mornings to help me with her, but the doctors I say she may lose control of her bowels, and ... and ...&#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">He stopped, his throat working, trying hard not to cry in front of me again.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go with it as best you can,&#34; I said. I reached out across the table and briefly squeezed his palsied,</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">liverspotted hand. &#34;Do that day by day and give the rest over to God. There's nothing else you can do, is</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">there?&#34;</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="644" height="19" font="3">&#34;I guess not. But it's hard, Paul. I pray you never have to find out how hard.&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="309" height="19" font="3">He made an effort to collect himself.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Now tell me the news. How are you doing with William Wharton? And how are you making out with</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="149" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore?&#34;</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">We talked shop for a while, and got through the visit. After, all the way home, with my wife sitting</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">silent, for the most part - wet-eyed and thoughtful - in the passenger seat beside me, Coffey's words ran</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="762" height="19" font="3">around in my head like Mr. Jingles running around in Delacroix's cell: I <i>helped it, didn't I?</i></text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's terrible,&#34; my wife said dully at one point. &#34;And there's nothing anyone can do to help her.&#34;</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">I nodded agreement and thought, I <i>helped it, didn't</i> I? But that was crazy, and I tried as best I could to put</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="152" height="19" font="3">it out of my mind.</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">As we turned into our dooryard, she finally spoke a second time - not about her old friend Melinda, but</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">about my urinary infection. She wanted to know if it was really gone. Really gone, I told her.</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's fine, then,&#34; she said, and kissed me over the eyebrow, in that shivery place of mine. &#34;Maybe we</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">ought to, you know, get up to a little something. If you have the time and the inclination, that is.&#34;</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Having plenty of the latter and just enough of the former, I took her by the hand and led her into the back</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">bedroom and took her clothes off as she stroked the part of me that swelled and throbbed but didn't hurt</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">anymore. And as I moved in her sweetness, slipping through it in that slow way she liked - that we both</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">liked - I thought of John Coffey, saying he'd helped it, he'd helped it, hadn't he? Like a snatch of song</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="509" height="19" font="3">that won't leave your mind until it's damned good and ready.</text>

<page number="90" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">Later, as I drove to the prison, I got to thinking that very soon we would have to start rehearsing for</text>
<text top="71" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's execution. That thought led to how Percy was going to be out front this time, and I felt a</text>
<text top="95" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">shiver of dread. I told myself to just go with it, one execution and we'd very likely be shut of Percy</text>
<text top="119" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Wetmore for good ... but still I felt that shiver, as if the infection I'd been suffering with wasn't gone at</text>
<text top="143" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">all, but had only switched locations, from boiling my groin to freezing my backbone.</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>7.</b></text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on,&#34; Brutal told Delacroix the following evening. &#34;We're going for a little walk. You and me and</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="108" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles.&#34;</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Delacroix looked at him distrustfully, then reached down into the cigar box for the mouse. He cupped it</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="550" height="19" font="3">m the palm of one hand and looked at Brutal with narrowed eyes.</text>
<text top="347" left="15" width="312" height="19" font="3">&#34;Whatchoo talking about?&#34; he asked.</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's a big night for you and Mr. Jingles,&#34; Dean said, as he and Harry joined Brutal. The chain of bruises</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">around Dean's neck had gone an unpleasant yellow color, but at least he could talk again without</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">sounding like a dog barking at a cat. He looked at Brutal. &#34;Think we ought to put the shackles on him,</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="65" height="19" font="3">Brute?&#34;</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">Brutal appeared to consider. &#34;Naw,&#34; he said at last. &#34;He's gonna be good, ain't you, Del? You and the</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">mouse, both. After all, you're gonna be showin off for some high muck-a-mucks tonight.&#34;</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Percy and I were standing up by the duty desk, watching this, Percy with his arms folded and a small,</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">contemptuous smile on his lips. After a bit, he took out his horn comb and went to work on his hair with</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">it. John Coffey was watching, too, standing silently at the bars of his cell. Wharton was lying on his</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">bunk, staring up at the ceiling and ignoring the whole show. He was still &#34;being good,&#34; although what he</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">called <i>good</i> was what the docs at Briar Ridge called <i>catatonic.</i> And there was one other person there, as</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">well. He was tucked out of sight in my office, but his skinny shadow fell out the door and onto the Green</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="45" height="19" font="3">Mile.</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;What dis about, you <i>gran' 'fou?&#34;</i> Del asked querulously, drawing his feet up on the bunk as Brutal undid</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">the double locks on his cell door and ran it open. His eyes flicked back and forth among the three of</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="47" height="19" font="3">them.</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, I tell you,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Mr. Moores is gone for awhile - his wife is under the weather, as you may</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="548" height="19" font="3">have heard. So Mr. Anderson is in charge, Mr. Curtis Anderson.&#34;</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="326" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah? What that. got to do with me?&#34;</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well,&#34; Harry said, &#34;Boss Anderson's heard about your mouse, Del, and wants to see him perform. He</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">and about six other fellows are over in Admin, just waiting for you to show up. Not just plain old bluesuit</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">guards, either. These are pretty big bugs, just like Brute said. One of them, I believe, is a politician all the</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="231" height="19" font="3">way from the state capital.&#34;</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Delacroix swelled visibly at this, and I saw not so much as a single shred of doubt on his face. Of course</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="402" height="19" font="3">they wanted to see Mr. Jingles; who would not?</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">He scrummed around, first under his bunk and then under his pillow. He eventually found one of those</text>
</page>
<page number="91" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">big pink peppermints and the wildly colored spool. He looked at Brutal questioningly, and Brutal</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="67" height="19" font="3">nodded.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep. It's the spool trick they're really wild to see, I guess, but the way he eats those mints is pretty</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="730" height="19" font="3">damned cute, too. And don't forget the cigar box. You'll want it to carry him in, right?&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Delacroix got the box and put Mr. Jingles's props in it, but mouse he settled on the shoulder of his shirt.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Then he stepped out of his cell, his puffed-out chest leading the way, and regarded Dean and Harry. &#34;You</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="126" height="19" font="3">boys coming?&#34;</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">&#34;Naw,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Got other fish to fry. But you knock em for a loop, Del - show em what happens</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="598" height="19" font="3">when a Louisiana boy puts the hammer down and really goes to work.&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;You bet.&#34; A smile shone out of his face, so sudden and so simple in its happiness that I felt my heart</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">break for him a little, in spite of the terrible thing he had done. What a world we live in - what a world!</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Delacroix turned to John Coffey, with whom he had struck up a diffident friendship not much different</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">from a hundred other deathhouse acquaintances I'd seen.</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="786" height="19" font="3">&#34;You knock em for a loop, Del,&#34; Coffey said in a serious voice. &#34;You show em all his tricks.&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Delacroix nodded and held his hand up by his shoulder. Mr. Jingles stepped onto it like it was a platform,</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">and Delacroix held the hand out toward Coffey's cell. John Coffey stuck out a huge finger, and I'll be</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">damned if that mouse didn't stretch out his neck and lick the end of it, just like a dog.</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, Del, quit lingerin,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;These folks're settin back a hot dinner at home to watch your</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">mouse cut his capers.&#34; Not true, of course Anderson would have been there until eight o'clock on any</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">night, and the guards he'd dragged in to watch Delacroix's &#34;show&#34; would be there until eleven or twelve,</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">depending on when their shifts were scheduled to end. The politician from the state capital would most</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">likely turn out to be an office janitor in a borrowed tie. But Delacroix had no way of knowing any of that.</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm ready,&#34; Delacroix said, speaking with the simplicity of a great star who has somehow managed to</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">retain the common touch. &#34;Let's go.&#34; And as Brutal led him up the Green Mile with Mr. Jingles perched</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">there on the little man's shoulder, Delacroix once more began to bugle, <i>&#34;Messieurs et mesdames!</i></text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="4"><i>Bienvenue au cirque de mousie!&#34;</i> Yet, even lost as deeply in his own fantasy world as he was, he gave</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="369" height="19" font="3">Percy a wide berth and a mistrustful glance.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">Harry and Dean stopped in front of the empty cell across from Wharton's (that worthy had still not so</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">much as stirred). They watched as Brutal unlocked the door to the exercise yard, where another two</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">guards were waiting to join him, and led Delacroix out, bound for his command performance before the</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">grand high poohbahs of Cold Mountain Penitentiary. We waited until the door was locked again, and</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">then I looked toward my office. That shadow was still lying on the floor, thin as famine, and I was glad</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="337" height="19" font="3">Delacroix had been too excited to see it.</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on out,&#34; I said. &#34;And let's move along brisk, folks. I want to get two run-throughs in, and we don't</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="148" height="19" font="3">have much time.&#34;</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Old Toot-Toot, looking as bright-eyed and bushytailed as ever, came out, walked to Delacroix's cell, and</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">strolled in through the open door. &#34;Sittin down,&#34; he said. &#34;I'm sittin down, I'm sittin down, I'm sittin</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">down.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="92" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="41" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">This is the real circus, I thought, closing my eyes for a second. This is the real circus right here, and we're</text>
<text top="65" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">all just a bunch of trained mice. Then I put the thought out of my mind, and we started to rehearse.</text>
<text top="104" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>8.</b></text>
<text top="143" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">The first rehearsal went well, and so did the second. Percy performed better than I could have hoped for</text>
<text top="167" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">in my wildest dreams. That didn't mean things would go right when the time really came for the Cajun to</text>
<text top="191" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">walk the Mile, but it was a big step in the right direction. It occurred to me that it had gone well because</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Percy was at long last doing something he cared about. I felt a surge of contempt at that, and pushed it</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">away. What did it matter? He would cap Delacroix and roll him, and then both of them would be gone. If</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">that wasn't a happy ending, what was? And, as Moores had pointed out, Delacroix's nuts were going to</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="272" height="19" font="3">fry no matter who was out front.</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Still, Percy had shown to good advantage in his new role and he knew it. We all did. As for me, I was too</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">relieved to dislike him much, at east or the time being. It looked as if things were going to go all right. I</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">was further relieved to find that Percy actually listened when we suggested some things he could do that</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">might improve his performance even more, or at least cut down the possibility of something going</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">wrong. If you want to know the truth, we got pretty enthusiastic about it - even Dean, who ordinarily</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">stood well back from Percy - physically as well as mentally, if he could. None of it that surprising, either,</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I suppose - for most men, nothing is more flattering than having a young person actually pay attention to</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">his advice, and we were no different in that regard. As a result, not a one of us noticed that Wild Bill</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">Wharton was no longer looking up at the ceiling. That includes me, but I know he wasn't. He was looking</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">at us as we stood there by the duty desk, gassing and giving Percy advice. Giving him advice! And him</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="592" height="19" font="3">pretending to listen! Quite a laugh, considering how things turned out!</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="795" height="19" font="3">The sound of a key rattling into the lock of the door to the exercise yard put an end to our little</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">postrehearsal critique. Dean gave Percy a warning glance. &#34;Not a word or a wrong look,&#34; he said. &#34;We</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="716" height="19" font="3">don't want him to know what we've been doing. It's not good for them. Upsets them.&#34;</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Percy nodded and ran a finger across his lips in a mum's-the-word gesture that was supposed to be funny</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">and wasn't. The exercise-yard door opened and Delacroix came in, escorted by Brutal, who was carrying</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">the cigar box with the colored spool in it, the way the magician's assistant in a vaudeville show might</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">carry the boss's props offstage at the end of the act. Mr. Jingles was perched on Delacroix's shoulder.</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">And Delacroix himself? I -tell you what - Lillie Langtry couldn't have looked any glowier after</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">performing at the White House. &#34;They love Mr. Jingles!&#34;</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="570" height="19" font="3">Delacroix proclaimed. &#34;They laugh and cheer and clap they hands!&#34;</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, that's aces,&#34; Percy said. He spoke in an indulgent, proprietary way that didn't sound like the old</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="421" height="19" font="3">Percy at all. &#34;Pop on back in your cell, old-timer.&#34;</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Delacroix gave him a comical look of distrust, and the old Percy came busting out. He bared his teeth in</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">a mock snarl and made as if to grab Delacroix. It was a joke, of course, Percy was happy, not in a serious</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">grabbing mood at all, but Delacroix didn't know that. He jerked away with an expression of fear and</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">dismay, and tripped over one of Brutal's big feet. He went down hard, hitting the linoleum with the back</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">of his head. Mr. Jingles leaped away in time to avoid being crushed, and went squeaking off down the</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="259" height="19" font="3">Green Mile to Delacroix's cell.</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Delacroix got to his feet, gave the chuckling Percy a single hate-filled glance, then scurried off after his</text>
</page>
<page number="93" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">pet, calling for him and rubbing the back of his head. Brutal (who didn't know that Percy had shown</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">exciting signs of competency for a change) gave Percy a wordless look of contempt and went after Del,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="176" height="19" font="3">shaking his keys out.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">I think what happened next happened because Percy was actually moved to apologize - I know it's hard</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">to believe, but he was in an extraordinary humor that day. If true, it only proves a cynical old adage I</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">heard once, something about how no good deed goes unpunished. Remember me telling you about how,</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">after he'd chased the mouse down to the restraint room on one of those two occasions before Delacroix</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">joined us, Perry got a little too close to The Pres's cell? Doing that was dangerous, which was why the</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Green Mile was so wide - when you walked straight down the middle of it, you couldn't be reached from</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">the cells. The Pres hadn't done anything to Percy, but I remember thinking that Arlen Bitterbuck might</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="656" height="19" font="3">have, had it been him Percy had gotten too close to. just to teach him a lesson.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Well, The Pres and The Chief had both moved on, but Wild Bill Wharton had taken their place. He was</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">worse-mannered than The Pres or The Chief had ever dreamed of being, and he'd been watching the</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">whole little play, hoping for a chance to get on stage himself. That chance now fell into his lap, courtesy</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="159" height="19" font="3">of Percy Wetmore.</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey, Del!&#34; Percy called, half-laughing, starting after Brutal and Delacroix and drifting much too close</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">to Wharton's side of the Green Mile without realizing it. &#34;Hey, you numb shit, I didn't mean nothin by it!</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="128" height="19" font="3">Are you all ri-&#34;</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Wharton was up off his bunk and over to the bars of his cell in a flash - never in my time as a guard did I</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">see anyone move so fast, and that includes some of the athletic young men Brutal and I worked with later</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">at Boys' Correctional. He shot his arms out through the bars and grabbed Percy, first by the shoulders of</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">his uniform blouse and then by the throat. Wharton dragged him back against his cell door. Percy</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">squealed like a pig in a slaughter-chute, and I saw from his eyes that he thought he was going to die.</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ain't you sweet,&#34; Wharton whispered. One hand left Percy's throat and ruffled through his hair. &#34;Soft!&#34;</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">he said, half-laughing. &#34;Like a girl's. I druther fuck your asshole than your sister's pussy, I think.&#34; And he</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="225" height="19" font="3">actually kissed Percy's ear.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I think Percy - who had beat Delacroix onto the block for accidentally brushing his crotch, remember -</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">knew exactly what was happening. I doubt that he wanted to, but I think he did. All the color had drained</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">from his face, and the blemishes on his cheeks stood out like birthmarks. His eyes were huge and wet. A</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">line of spittle leaked from one comer of his twitching mouth. All this happened quick - it was begun and</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="313" height="19" font="3">done in less than ten seconds, I'd say.</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Harry and I stepped forward, our billies raised. Dean drew his gun. But before things could go so much</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">as an inch further, Wharton let go of Perry and stepped back, raising his hands to his shoulders and</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">grinning his dank grin. &#34;I let im go, I 'us just playin and I let im go,&#34; he said. &#34;Never hurt airy single hair</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="766" height="19" font="3">on that boy's purty head, so don't you go stickin me down in that goddam soft room again.&#34;</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore darted across the Green Mile and cringed against the barred door of the empty cell on the</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">other side, breathing so fast and so loud that it sounded almost like sobbing. He had finally gotten his</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">lesson in keeping to the center of the Green Mile and away from the frumious bandersnatch, the teeth</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">that bite and the claws that catch. I had an idea it was a lesson that would stick with him longer than all</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="391" height="19" font="3">the advice we'd given him after our rehearsals.</text>
</page>
<page number="94" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">There was an expression of utter terror on his face, and his precious hair was seriously mussed up for the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">first time since I'd met him, all in spikes and tangles. He looked like someone who has just escaped being</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="52" height="19" font="3">raped.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">There was a moment of utter stop then, a quiet so thick that the only sound was the sobbing whistle of</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Percy's breathing. What broke it was cackling laughter, so sudden and so completely its own mad thing</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">that it was shocking. Wharton, was my first thought, but it wasn't him. It was Delacroix, standing in the</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">open door of his cell and pointing at Percy. The mouse was back on his shoulder, and Delacroix looked</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="499" height="19" font="3">like a small but malevolent male witch, complete with imp.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lookit him, he done piss his pants!&#34; Delacroix howled. &#34;Lookit what the big man done! Bus' other</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">people wid 'is stick, mais oui some mauvais homme, but when someone touch him, he make water in 'is</text>

<text top="344" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">He laughed and pointed, all his fear and hatred of Percy coming out in that derisive laughter. Percy stared</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">at him, seemingly incapable of moving or speaking. Wharton stepped back to the bars of his cell, looked</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">down at the dark splotch on the front of Percy's trousers - it was small but it was there, and no question</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">about what it was - and grinned. &#34;Somebody ought to buy the tough boy a didy,&#34; he said, and went back</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="254" height="19" font="3">to his bunk, chuffing laughter.</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Brutal went down to Delacroix's cell, but the Cajun had ducked inside and thrown himself on his bunk</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="247" height="19" font="3">before Brutal could get there.</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">I reached out and grasped Percy's shoulder. &#34;Percy-&#34; I began, but that was as far as I got. He came to life,</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">shaking my hand off. He looked down at the front of his pants, saw the spot spreading there, and blushed</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">a dark, fiery red. He looked up at me again, then at Harry and Dean. I remember being glad that Old</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Toot-Toot was gone. If he'd been around, the story would have been all over the prison in a single day.</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">And, given Percy's last name-an unfortunate one, in this context - it was a story that would have been</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="421" height="19" font="3">told with the relish of high glee for years to come.</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;You talk about this to anyone, and you'll all be on the breadlines in a week,&#34; he whispered fiercely. It</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">was the sort of crack that would have made me want to swat him under other circumstances, but under</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">these, I only pitied him. I think he saw that pity, and it made it worse with him - like having an open</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="236" height="19" font="3">wound scoured with nettles.</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="750" height="19" font="3">'&#34;What goes on here stays here,&#34; Dean said quietly. &#34;You don't have to worry about that.&#34;</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Percy looked back over his shoulder, toward Delacroix's cell. Brutal was just locking the door, and from</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">inside, deadly clear, we could still hear Delacroix giggling. Percy's look was as black as thunder. I</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">thought of telling him that you reaped what you sowed in this life, and then decided this might not be the</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="268" height="19" font="3">right time for a scripture lesson.</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;As for him - &#34; he began, but never finished. He left, instead, head down, to go into the storage room and</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="230" height="19" font="3">look for a dry pair of pants.</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's so purty,&#34; Wharton said in a dreamy voice. Harry told him to shut the fuck up before he went down</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">to the restraint room just on general damned principles. Wharton folded his arms on his chest, closed his</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="282" height="19" font="3">eyes, and appeared to go to sleep.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">The night before Delacroix's execution came down hotter and muggier than ever - eighty-one degrees by</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the thermometer outside the Admin readyroom window when I clocked in at six. Eighty-one degrees at</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">the end of October, think of that, and thunder rumbling in the west like it does in July. I'd met a member</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">of my congregation in town that afternoon, and he had asked me, with apparent seriousness, if I thought</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">such unseasonable weather could be a sign of the Last Times. I said that I was sure not, but it crossed my</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="658" height="19" font="3">mind that it was Last Times for Eduard Delacroix, all right. Yes indeed it was.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Bill Dodge was standing in the door to the exercise yard, drinking coffee and smoking him a little smoke.</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">He looked around at me and said, &#34;Well, lookit here. Paul Edgecombe, big as life and twice as ugly.&#34;</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="227" height="19" font="3">&#34;How'd the day go, Billy?&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="94" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right.&#34;</text>

<text top="374" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Fine. He seems to understand it's tomorrow, and yet it's like he <i>don't </i>understand. You know how most</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="406" height="19" font="3">of em are when the end finally comes for them.&#34;</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="180" height="19" font="3">I nodded. &#34;Wharton?'</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Bill laughed. &#34;What a comedian. Makes Jack Benny sound like a Quaker. He told Rolfe Wettermark that</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="387" height="19" font="3">he ate strawberry jam out of his wife's pussy.&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="189" height="19" font="3">&#34;What did Rolfe say?&#34;</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="724" height="19" font="3">&#34;That he wasn't married. Said it must have been his mother Wharton was thinking of.&#34;</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I laughed, and hard. That really was funny, in a low sort of way. And it was good just to be able to laugh</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">without feeling like someone was lighting matches way down low in my gut. Bill laughed with me, then</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">turned the rest of his coffee out in the yard, which was empty except for a few shuffling trusties, most of</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="407" height="19" font="3">whom had been there for a thousand years or so.</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">Thunder rumbled somewhere far off, and unfocused heat lightning flashed in the darkening sky</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="450" height="19" font="3">overhead. Bill looked up uneasily, his laughter dying.</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;I tell you what, though,&#34; he said, &#34;I don't like this weather much. Feels like something's gonna happen.</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="140" height="19" font="3">Something bad.&#34;</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">About that he was right. The bad thing happened right around quarter of ten that night. That was when</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="206" height="19" font="3">Percy killed Mr. Jingles.</text>

<text top="146" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">for him. No, what he cared about - you've guessed already, I'm sure - was what was going to happen to</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles after he, Delacroix, passed on. I was used to spending long hours with the condemned on the</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">night before their last march, but this was the first time I'd spent those long hours pondering the fate of a</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">mouse.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Del considered scenario after scenario, patiently working the possibilities through his dim mind. And</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">while he thought aloud, wanting to provide for his pet mouse's future as if it were a child that had to be</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">put through college, he threw that colored spool against the wall. Each time he did it, Mr. Jingles would</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">spring after it, track it down, and then roll it back to Del's foot. It started to get on my nerves after awhile</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">-first the clack of the spool against the stone wall, then the minute clitter of Mr. Jingles's paws. Although</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">it was a cute trick, it palled after ninety minutes or so. And Mr. Jingles never seemed to get tired. He</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">paused every now and then to refresh himself with a drink of water out of a coffee saucer Delacroix kept</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">for just that purpose, or to munch a pink crumb of peppermint candy, and then back to it he went. Several</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">times it was on the tip of my tongue to tell Delacroix to give it a rest, and each time I reminded myself</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">that he had this night and tomorrow to play the spool-game with Mr. Jingles, and that was all. Near the</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">end, though, it began to be really difficult to hold onto that thought - you know how it is, with a noise</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">that's repeated over and over. After a while it shoots your nerve. I started to speak after all, then</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">something made me look over my shoulder and out the cell door. John Coffey was standing at his cell</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">door across the way, and he shook his head at me: right, left, back to center. As if he had read my mind</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="284" height="19" font="3">and was telling me to think again.</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">I would see that Mr. Jingles got to Delacroix's maiden aunt, I said, the one who had sent him the big bag</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">of candy. His colored spool could go as well, even his &#34;house&#34; - we'd take up a collection and see that</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Toot gave up his claim on the Corona box. No, said Delacroix after some consideration (he had time to</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">throw the spool against the wall at least five times, with Mr. Jingles either nosing it back or pushing it</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">with his paws), that wouldn't do. Aunt Hermione was too old, she wouldn't understand Mr. Jingles's</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">frisky ways, and suppose Mr. Jingles outlived her? What would happen to him then? No, no, Aunt</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="229" height="19" font="3">Hermione just wouldn't do.</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Well, then, I asked, suppose one of us took it? One of us guards? We could keep him right here on E</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Block. No, Delacroix said, he thanked me kindly for the thought, <i>certainement,</i> but Mr. Jingles was a</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">mouse that yearned to be free. He, Eduard Delacroix, knew this, because Mr. Jingles had - you guessed it</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="321" height="19" font="3">- whispered the information in his ear.</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; I said, &#34;one of us will take him home, Del. Dean, maybe. He's got a little boy that would just</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="204" height="19" font="3">love a pet mouse, I bet.&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">Delacroix actually turned pale with horror at the thought. A little kid in charge of a rodent genius like</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles? How in the name of <i>le bon Dieu </i>could a little kid be expected to keep up with his training,</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">let alone teach him new tricks? And suppose the kid lost interest and forgot to feed him for two or three</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">days at a stretch? Delacroix, who had roasted six human beings alive in an effort to cover up his original</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="639" height="19" font="3">crime, shuddered with the delicate revulsion of an ardent anti-vivisectionist.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">All right, I said, I'd take him myself (promise them anything, remember; in their last forty-eight hours,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="381" height="19" font="3">promise them anything). How would that be?</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, sir, Boss Edgecombe,&#34; Del said apologetically. He threw the spool again. It hit the wall, bounced,</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">spun; then Mr. Jingles was on it like white on rice and nosing it back to Delacroix. &#34;Thank you kindly -</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">merci beaucoup - but you live out in the woods, and Mr. Jingles, he be scared to live out <i>dans la foret. I</i></text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="139" height="19" font="3">know, because-&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think I can guess how you know, Del,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Delacroix nodded, smiling. &#34;But we gonna figure this out. You bet!&#34; He threw the spool. Mr. Jingles</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="305" height="19" font="3">clittered after it. I tried not to wince.</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">In the end it was Brutal who saved the day. He had been up by the duty desk, watching Dean and Harry</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">play cribbage. Percy was there, too, and Brutal finally tired of trying to start a conversation with him and</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">getting nothing but sullen grunts in response. He strolled down to where I sat on a stool outside of</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="570" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's cell and stood there listening to us with his arms folded.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;How about Mouseville?&#34; Brutal asked into the considering silence which followed Del's rejection of my</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">spooky old house out in the woods. He threw the comment out in a casual just-an-idea tone of voice.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mouseville?&#34; Delacroix asked, giving Brutal a look both startled and interested. &#34;What Mouseville?&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="777" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's this tourist attraction down in Florida,&#34; he said. &#34;Tallahassee, I think. Is that right, Paul?</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="116" height="19" font="3">Tallahassee?&#34;</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep,&#34; I said, speaking without a moment's hesitation, thinking God bless Brutus Howell. &#34;Tallahassee.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Right down the road apiece from the dog university.&#34; Brutal's mouth twitched at that, and I thought he</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">was going to queer the pitch by laughing, but he got it under control and nodded. I'd hear about the dog</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="302" height="19" font="3">university later, though, I imagined.</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">This time Del didn't throw the spool, although Mr. Jingles stood on Del's slipper with his front paws</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">raised, clearly lusting for another chance to chase. The Cajun looked from Brutal to me and back to</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="452" height="19" font="3">Brutal again. &#34;What dey do in Mouseville?&#34; he asked.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;You think they'd take Mr. Jingles?&#34; Brutal asked me, simultaneously ignoring Del and drawing him on.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="268" height="19" font="3">&#34;Think he's got the stuff, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I tried to appear considering. &#34;You know,&#34; I said, &#34;the more I think of it, the more it seems like a brilliant</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">idea.&#34; From the comer of my eye I saw Percy come partway down the Green Mile (giving Wharton's cell</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">a very wide berth). He stood with one shoulder leaning against an empty cell, listening with a small,</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="265" height="19" font="3">contemptuous smile on his lips.</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="476" height="19" font="3">&#34;What dis Mouseville?&#34; Del asked, now frantic to know.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">&#34;A tourist attraction, like I told you,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;There's, oh I dunno, a hundred or so mice there.</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="213" height="19" font="3">Wouldn't you say, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;More like a hundred and fifty these days,&#34; I said. &#34;It's a big success. I understand they're thinking of</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">opening one out in California and calling it Mouseville West, that's how much business is booming.</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="780" height="19" font="3">Trained mice are the coming thing with the smart set, I guess - I don't understand it, myself.&#34;</text>

<page number="98" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Del sat with the colored spool in his hand, looking at us, his own situation forgotten for the time being.</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;They only take the smartest mice,&#34; Brutal cautioned, &#34;the ones that can do tricks. And they can't be</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="388" height="19" font="3">white mice, because those are pet-shop mice.&#34;</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="710" height="19" font="3">&#34;Pet-shop mice, yeah, you bet!&#34; Delacroix said fiercely. &#34;I hate dem pet-shop mice!&#34;</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;And what they got,&#34; Brutal said, his eyes distant now as he imagined it, &#34;is this tent you go into-&#34;</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="495" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, yeah, like inna <i>cirque!</i> Do you gotta pay to get in?&#34;</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;You shittin me? Course you gotta pay to get in. A dime apiece, two cents for the kiddies. And there's,</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">like, this whole city made out of Bakelite boxes and toilet-paper rolls, with windows made out of</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="439" height="19" font="3">isinglass so you can see what they're up to in there-&#34;</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="734" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah! Yeah!&#34; Delacroix was in ecstasy now. Then he turned to me. &#34;What ivy-glass?&#34;</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="499" height="19" font="3">&#34;Like on the front of a stove, where you can see in,&#34; I. said.</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh sure! Dat shit!&#34; He cranked his hand at Brutal, wanting him to go on, and Mr. Jingles's little oildrop</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">eyes practically spun in their sockets, trying to keep that spool in view. It was pretty funny. Percy came a</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">little closer, as if wanting to get a better look, and I saw John Coffey frowning at him, but I was too</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">wrapped up in Brutal's fantasy to pay much attention. This took telling the condemned man what he</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="572" height="19" font="3">wanted to hear to new heights, and I was all admiration, believe me.</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">'&#34;Well,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;there's the mouse city, but what the kids really like is the Mouseville All-Star</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">Circus, where there's mice that swing on trapezes, and mice that roll these little barrels, and mice that</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="108" height="19" font="3">stack coins-&#34;</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, dat's it! Dat's the place for Mr. Jingles!&#34; Delacroix said. His eyes sparkled and his cheeks were</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">high with color. It occurred to me that Brutus Howell was a kind of saint. &#34;You gonna be a circus mouse</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">after all, Mr. Jingles! Gonna live in a mouse city down Florida! All ivy-glass windows! Hurrah!&#34;</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">He threw the spool extra-hard. It hit low on the wall, took a crazy bounce, and squirted out between the</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">bars of his cell door and onto the Mile. Mr. Jingles raced out after it, and Percy saw his chance.</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, you fool!&#34; Brutal yelled, but Percy paid no attention. Just as Mr. Jingles reached the spool - too</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">intent on it to realize his old enemy was at hand - Percy brought the sole of one hard black workshoe</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">down on it. There was an audible snap as Mr. Jingles's back broke, and blood gushed from his mouth.</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">His tiny dark eyes bulged in their sockets, and in them I read an expression of surprised agony that was</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="121" height="19" font="3">all too human.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Delacroix screamed with horror and grief. He threw himself at the door of his cell and thrust his arms out</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="719" height="19" font="3">between the bars, reaching as far as he could, crying the mouse's name over and over.</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Percy turned toward him, smiling. Toward the three of us. &#34;There,&#34; he said. &#34;I knew I'd get him, sooner</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">or later. Just a matter of time, really.&#34; He turned and walked back up the Green Mile, not hurrying,</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="665" height="19" font="3">leaving Mr. Jingles lying on the linoleum in a spreading pool of his own blood.</text>

<text top="254" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">All this other writing aside, I've kept a little diary since I took up residence at Georgia Pines - no big</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">deal, just a couple of paragraphs a day, mostly about the weather - and I looked back through it last</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">evening. I wanted to see just how long it has been since my grandchildren, Christopher and Danielle,</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">more or less forced me into Georgia Pines. &#34;For your own good, Gramps,&#34; they said. Of course they did.</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">Isn't that what people mostly say when they have finally figured out how to get rid of a problem that</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="139" height="19" font="3">walks and talks?</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">It's been a little over two years. The eerie thing is that I don't know if it <i>feels</i> like two years, or longer</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">than that, or shorter. My sense of time seems to be <i>melting,</i> like a kid's snowman in a January thaw. It's</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">as if time as it always was - Eastern Standard Time, Daylight Saving Tune, Working-Man Time - doesn't</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">exist anymore. Here there is only Georgia Pines Time, which is Old Man Time, Old Lady Time, and Piss</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="290" height="19" font="3">the Bed Tune. The rest <i>...</i> all gone.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">This is a dangerous damned place. You don't you think it's only a boring dangerous as a nursery school at</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">naptime, but it's dangerous, all right. I've seen a lot of people slide into senility since I came here, and</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">sometimes they do more than slide sometimes they go down with the speed of a crash-diving submarine.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">They come here mostly all right - dim-eyed and welded to the cane, maybe a little loose in the bladder,</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">but otherwise okay - and then something happens to them. A month later they're just sitting in the TV</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">room, staring up at Oprah Winfrey on the TV with dull eyes, a slack jaw, and a forgotten glass of orange</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">juice tilted and dribbling in one hand. A month after that, you have to tell them their kids' names when</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">the kids come to visit. And a month after that, it's their own damned names you have to refresh them on.</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Something happens to them, all right: Georgia Pines Time happens to them. Time here is like a weak</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="540" height="19" font="3">acid that erases first memory and then the desire to go on living.</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">You have to fight it. That's what I tell Elaine Connelly, my special friend. It's gotten better for me since I</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">started writing about what happened to me in 1932, the year John Coffey came on the Green Mile. Some</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">of the memories are awful, but I can feel them sharpening my mind and my awareness the way a knife</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">sharpens a pencil, and that makes the pain worthwhile. Writing and memory alone aren't enough, though.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I also have a body, wasted and grotesque, though it may now be, and I exercise it as much as I can. It was</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">hard at first - old fogies like me aren't much shakes when it comes to exercise just for the sake of exercise</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="459" height="19" font="3">- but it's easier now that there's a purpose to my walks.</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I go out before breakfast - as soon as it's light, most days - for my first stroll. It was raining this morning,</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">and the damp makes my joints ache, but I hooked a poncho from the rack by the kitchen door and went</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">out, anyway. When a man has a chore, he has to do it, and if it hurts, too bad. Besides, there are</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">compensations. The chief one is keeping that sense of Real Time, as opposed to Georgia Pines Time.</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">And I like the rain, aches or no aches. Especially in the early morning, when the day is young and seems</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="482" height="19" font="3">full of possibilities, even to a washed-up old boy like me.</text>
</page>
<page number="100" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="44" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">I went through the kitchen, stopping to beg two slices of toast from one of the sleepy-eyed cooks, and</text>
<text top="68" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">then went out. I crossed the croquet course, then the weedy little putting green. Beyond that is a small</text>
<text top="92" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">stand of woods, with a narrow path winding through it and a couple of sheds, no longer used and</text>
<text top="116" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">mouldering away quietly, along the way. I walked down this path slowly, listening to the sleek and secret</text>
<text top="140" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">patter of the rain in the pines, chewing away at a piece of toast with my few remaining teeth. My legs</text>
<text top="164" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">ached, but it was a low ache, manageable. Mostly I felt pretty well. I drew the moist gray air as deep as I</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="234" height="19" font="3">could, taking it in like food.</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">And when I got to the second of those old sheds, I went in for awhile, and I took care of my business</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="47" height="19" font="3">there.</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">When I walked back up the path twenty minutes later, I could feel a worm of hunger stirring in my belly,</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">and thought I could eat something a little more substantial than toast. A dish of oatmeal, perhaps even a</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">scrambled egg with a sausage on the side. I love sausage, always have, but if I eat more than one these</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">days, I'm apt to get the squitters. One would be safe enough, though. Then, with my belly full and with</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">the damp air still perking up my brain (or so I hoped), I would go up to the solarium and write about the</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="776" height="19" font="3">execution of Eduard Delacroix. I would do it as fast as I could, so as not to lose my courage.</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">It was Mr. Jingles I was thinking about as I crossed the croquet course to the kitchen door - how Percy</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Wetmore had stamped on him and broken his back, and how Delacroix had screamed when he realized</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">what his enemy had done - and I didn't see Brad Dolan standing there, half-hidden by the Dumpster, until</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="316" height="19" font="3">he reached out and grabbed my wrist.</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="341" height="19" font="3">&#34;Out for a little stroll, Paulie?&#34; he asked.</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">I jerked back from him, yanking my wrist out of his hand. Some of it was just being startled - anyone</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">will jerk when they're startled - but that wasn't all of it. I'd been thinking about Percy Wetmore,</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">remember, and it's Percy that Brad always reminds me of. Some of it's how Brad always goes around</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">with a paperback stuffed into his pocket (with Percy it was always a men's adventure magazine; with</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Brad it's books of jokes that are only funny if you're stupid and mean-hearted), some of it's how he acts</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="753" height="19" font="3">like he's King Shit of Turd Mountain, but mostly it's that he's sneaky, and he likes to hurt.</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">He'd just gotten to work, I saw, hadn't even changed into his orderly's whites yet. He was wearing jeans</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">and a cheesy-looking Western-style shirt. In one hand was the remains of a Danish he'd hooked out of the</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">kitchen. He'd been standing under the leave, eating it where he wouldn't get wet. And where he could</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">watch for me, I'm pretty sure of that now. I'm pretty sure of something else, as well: I'll have to watch out</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">for Mr. Brad Dolan. He doesn't like me much. I don't know why, but I never knew why Percy Wetmore</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">didn't like Delacroix, either. And <i>dislike is</i> really too weak a word. Percy hated Del's guts from the very</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="512" height="19" font="3">first moment the little Frenchman came onto the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="790" height="19" font="3">'&#34;What's with this poncho you got on, Paulie?&#34; he asked, flicking the collar. &#34;This isn't yours.&#34;</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;I got it in the hall outside the kitchen,&#34; I said. I hate it when he calls me Paulie, and I think he knows it,</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">but I was damned if I'd give him the satisfaction of seeing it. &#34;There's a whole row of them. I'm not</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="557" height="19" font="3">hurting it any, would you say? Rain's what it's made for, after all.&#34;</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">&#34;But it wasn't made for you, Paulie,&#34; he said, giving it another little flick. &#34;That's the thing. Those</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="300" height="19" font="3">&#34;I still don't see what harm it does.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">He gave me a thin little smile. &#34;It's not about <i>harm,</i> it's about the <i>rules.</i> What would life be without rules?</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Paulie, Paulie, Paulie.&#34; He shook his head, as if just looking at me made him feel sorry to be alive. &#34;You</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">probably think an old fart like you doesn't have to mind about the rules anymore, but that's just not true.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="66" height="19" font="3">Paulie.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">Smiling at me. Disliking me. Maybe even hating me. And why? I don't know. Sometimes there is no</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="221" height="19" font="3">why. That's the scary part.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, I'm sorry if I broke the rules,&#34; I said. It came out sounding whiney, a little shrill, and I hated</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="804" height="19" font="3">myself for sounding that way, but I'm old, and old people whine easily. Old people scare easily.</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Brad nodded. &#34;Apology accepted. Now go hang that back up. You got no business out walking in the</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">rain, anyway. Specially not in those woods. What if you were to slip and fall and break your damned hip?</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="648" height="19" font="3">Huh? Who do you think'd have to hoss your elderly freight back up the hill?&#34;</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know,&#34; I said. I just wanted to get away from him. The more I listened to him, the more he</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">sounded like Percy. William Wharton, the crazyman who came to the Green Mile in the fall of `32, once</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">grabbed Percy and scared him so bad that Percy squirted in his pants. <i>You talk about this to anyone,</i></text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Percy told the rest of us afterward, <i>and you'll all be on the breadlines in a week. Now,</i> these many years</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">later, I could almost hear Brad Dolan saying those same words, in that same tone of voice. It's as if, by</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">writing about those old times, I have unlocked some unspeakable door that connects the past to the</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">present - Percy Wetmore to Brad Dolan, Janice Edgecombe to Elaine Connelly, Cold Mountain</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Penitentiary to the Georgia Pines old folks' home. And if that thought doesn't keep me awake tonight, I</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="159" height="19" font="3">guess nothing will.</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">I made as if to go in through the kitchen door and Brad grabbed me by the wrist again. I don't know</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">about the first one, but this time he was doing it on purpose, squeezing to hurt. His eyes shifting back and</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">forth, making sure no one was around in the early-morning wet, no one to see he was abusing one of the</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="393" height="19" font="3">old folks he was supposed to be taking care of.</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;What do you do down that path?&#34; he asked. &#34;I know you don't go down there and jerk off, those days</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">are long behind you, so what do you do?&#34;</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said, telling myself to be calm, not to show him how bad he was hurting me and to be calm,</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">to remember he'd only mentioned the path, he didn't know about the shed. &#34;I just walk. To clear my</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="52" height="19" font="3">mind&#34;</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Too late for that, Paulie, your mind's never gonna be clear again!' He squeezed my thin old mares wrist</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">again, grinding the brittle bones, eyes continually shifting from side to side, wanting to make sure he was</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">safe. Brad wasn't afraid of breaking the rules; he was only afraid of being caught breaking them. And in</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">that, too, he was like Percy Wetmore, who would never let you forget he was the governor's nephew.</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">&#34;Old as you are, its a miracle you can remember who you are. You're too goddam old. Even for a</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="499" height="19" font="3">museum like this. You give me the fucking creeps, Paulie.&#34;</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let go of me,&#34; I said, trying to keep the whine out of my voice. It wasn't just pride, either. I thought if he</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">heard it, it might inflame him, the way the smell of sweat can sometimes inflame a bad-tempered dog -</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">one which would otherwise only growl - to bite. That made me think of a reporter who'd covered John</text>
</page>
<page number="102" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">Coffey's trial. The reporter was a terrible man named Hammersmith, and the most terrible thing about</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="385" height="19" font="3">him was that he hadn't known he was terrible.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Instead of letting go, Dolan squeezed my wrist again. I groaned. I didn't want to, but I couldn't help it. It</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="301" height="19" font="3">hurt all the way down to my ankles.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="399" height="19" font="3">&#34;What do you do down there, Paulie? Tell me.&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing!&#34; I said. I wasn't crying, not yet, but I was afraid I'd start soon if he kept bearing down like that.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="425" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing, I just walk, I like to walk, let go of me!&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">He did, but only long enough so he could grab my other hand. That one was rolled closed. &#34;Open up,&#34; he</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="185" height="19" font="3">said. &#34;Let Poppa see.&#34;</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">I did, and he grunted with disgust. It was nothing but the remains of my second piece of toast. I'd</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">clenched it in my right hand when he started squeezing my left wrist, and there was butter - well, oleo,</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="487" height="19" font="3">they don't have real butter here, of course - on my fingers.</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go on inside and wash your damned hands,&#34; he said, stepping back and taking another bite of his</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="193" height="19" font="3">Danish. &#34;Jesus Christ.&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I went up the steps. My legs were shaking, my heart pounding like an engine with leaky valves and shaky</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">old pistons. As I grasped the knob that would let me into the kitchen - and safety - Dolan said: &#34;If you tell</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">anyone I squeezed your po' old wrist, Paulie, I'll tell them you're having delusions. Onset of senile</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">dementia, likely. And you know they'll believe me. If there are bruises, they'll think you made them</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="83" height="19" font="3">yourself.&#34;</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Yes. Those things were true. And once again, it could have been Percy Wetmore saying them, a Percy</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="621" height="19" font="3">that had somehow stayed young and mean while I'd grown old and brittle.</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm not going to say anything to anyone,&#34; I mutered. &#34;Got nothing to say.&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right, you old sweetie.&#34; His voice light and mocking, the voice of a lugoon (to use Percy's word)</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">who thought he was going to be young forever. &#34;And I'm going to find out what you're up to. I'm going</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="298" height="19" font="3">to make it my business. You hear?&#34;</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">I heard, all right, but wouldn't give him the satisfaction of saying so. I went in, passed through the</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">kitchen (I could now smell eggs and sausage cooking, but no longer wanted any), and hung the poncho</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">back up on its hook. Then I went upstairs to my room - resting at every step, giving my heart time to</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="425" height="19" font="3">slow - and gathered my writing materials together.</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I went down to the solarium and was just sitting at the little table by the windows when my friend Elaine</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">poked her head in. She looked tired, and, I thought, unwell. She'd combed her hair out but was still in her</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="760" height="19" font="3">robe. We old sweeties don't stand much on ceremony; for the most part, we can't afford to.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="546" height="19" font="3">&#34;I won't disturb you,&#34; she said, &#34;I see you're getting set to write-&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="709" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't be silly,&#34; I said. &#34;I've got more time than Carter's got liver pills. Come on in.&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">She did, but stood by the door. &#34;It's just that I couldn't sleep - again - and happened to be looking out my</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="271" height="19" font="3">window a little earlier ... and ...&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="103" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;And you saw Mr. Dolan and me having our pleasant little chat,&#34; I said. I hoped seeing was all she'd</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">done; that her window had been closed and she hadn't heard me whining to be let go.</text>
<text top="101" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;It didn't look pleasant and it didn't look friendly,&#34; she said. &#34;Paul, that Mr. Dolan's been asking around</text>
<text top="125" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">about you. He asked <i>me</i> about you - last week, this was. I didn't think much about it then, just that he's</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="646" height="19" font="3">got himself a nasty long nose for other people's business, but now I wonder.&#34;</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="657" height="19" font="3">&#34;Asking about me?&#34; I hoped I didn't sound as uneasy as I felt. &#34;Asking what?&#34;</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="557" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where you go walking, for one thing. And why you go walking.&#34;</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="700" height="19" font="3">I tried to laugh. &#34;There's a man who doesn't believe in exercise, that much is clear.&#34;</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="459" height="19" font="3">&#34;He thinks you've got a secret.&#34; She paused. &#34;So do I.&#34;</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I opened my mouth - to say what, I don't know - but Elaine raised one of her gnarled but oddly beautiful</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">hands before I could get a single word out. &#34;If you do, I don't want to know what it is, Paul. Your</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">business is your business. I was raised to think that way, but not everyone was. Be careful. That's all I</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="515" height="19" font="3">want to tell you. And now I'll let you alone to do your work.&#34;</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">She turned to go, but before she could get out the door, I called her name. She turned back, eyes</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="103" height="19" font="3">questioning.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;When I finish what I'm writing-&#34; I began, then shook my head a little. That was wrong. &#34;If I finish what</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="269" height="19" font="3">I'm writing, would you read it?&#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">She seemed to consider, then gave me the sort of smile a man could easily fall in love with, even a man</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="3">as old as me. &#34;That would be my honor.&#34;</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;You'd better wait until you read it before you talk about honor,&#34; I said, and it was Delacroix's death I</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="136" height="19" font="3">was thinking of.</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="791" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll read it, though,&#34; she said. &#34;Every word. I promise. But you have to finish writing it, first.&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">She left me to it, but it was a long time before I wrote anything. I sat staring out the windows for almost</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">an hour, tapping my pen against the side of the table, watching the gray day brighten a little at a time,</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">thinking about Brad Dolan, who calls me Paulie and never tires of jokes about chinks and slopes and</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">spicks and micks, thinking about what Elaine Connelly had said. <i>He thinks you've got a secret. So</i> do I.</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">And maybe I do. Yes, maybe I do. And of course Brad Dolan wants it. Not because he thinks it's</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">important (and it's not, I guess, except to me), but because he doesn't think very old men like myself</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">should have secrets. No taking the ponchos off the hook outside the kitchen; no secrets, either. No getting</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">the idea that the likes of us are still human. And why shouldn't we be allowed such an idea? He doesn't</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">know. And in that, too, he is like Percy.</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">So my thoughts, like a river that takes an oxbow turn, finally led back to where they had been when Brad</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Dolan reached out from beneath the kitchen eave and grabbed my wrist: to Percy, mean-spirited Percy</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Wetmore, and how he had taken his revenge on the man who had laughed at him. Delacroix had been</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">throwing the colored spool he had - the one Mr. Jingles would fetch - and it bounced out of the cell and</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="505" height="19" font="3">into the corridor. That was all it took; Percy saw his chance.</text>
</page>
<page number="104" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>2.</b></text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;No you fool!&#34; Brutal yelled, but Percy paid no attention. Just as Mr. Jingles reached the spool - too</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">intent on it to realize his old enemy was at hand - Percy brought the sole of one hard black workshoe</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">down on him. There was an audible snap as Mr. Jingles's back broke, and blood gushed from his mouth.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">His tiny black eyes bulged in their sockets, and in them I read an expression of surprised agony that was</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="121" height="19" font="3">all too human.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Delacroix screamed with horror and grief. He threw himself at the door of his cell and thrust his arms out</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">through the bars, reaching as far as he could, crying the mouse's name over and over.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Percy turned toward him, smiling. Toward me and Brutal, as well. &#34;There,&#34; he said. &#34;I knew I'd get him,</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">sooner or later. just a matter of time, really.&#34; He turned and walked back up the Green Mile, leaving Mr.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="551" height="19" font="3">Jingles lying on the linoleum, his spreading blood red over green.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Dean got up from the duty desk, hitting the side of it with his knee and knocking the cribbage board to</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">the floor. The pegs spilled out of their holes and rolled in all directions. Neither Dean nor Harry, who had</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">been just about to go out, paid the slightest attention to the overturn of the game. &#34;What'd you do this</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="693" height="19" font="3">time?&#34; Dean shouted at Percy. &#34;What the hell'd you do this time, you stoopnagel?&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Percy didn't answer. He strode past the desk without saying a word, patting his hair with his fingers. He</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">went through my office and into the storage shed. William Wharton answered for him. &#34;Boss Dean? I</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">think what he did was teach a certain french-fry it ain't smart to laugh at him,&#34; he said, and then began to</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">laugh himself. It was a good laugh, a country laugh, cheery and deep. There were people I met during</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">that period of my life (very scary people, for the most part) who only sounded normal when they</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="386" height="19" font="3">laughed. Wild Bill Wharton was one of those.</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I looked down at the mouse again, stunned. It was still breathing, but there were little minute beads of</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">blood caught in the filaments of its whiskers, and a dull glaze was creeping over its previously brilliant</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="789" height="19" font="3">oildrop eyes. Brutal picked up the colored spool, looked at it, then looked at me. He looked as</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">dumbfounded as I felt. Behind us, Delacroix went on screaming out his grief and horror. It wasn't just the</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">mouse, of course; Percy had smashed a hole in Delacroix's defenses and all his terror was pouring out.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">But Mr. Jingles was the focusing point for those pent-up feelings, and it was terrible to listen to him.</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh no,&#34; he cried over and over again, amid the screams and the garbled pleas and prayers in Cajun</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="588" height="19" font="3">French. &#34;Oh no, oh no, poor Mr. Jingles, poor old Mr. Jingles, oh no.&#34;</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="143" height="19" font="3">&#34;Give im to me.&#34;</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I looked up, puzzled by that deep voice, at first not sure who it belonged to. I saw John Coffey. Like</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Delacroix, he had put his arms through the bars of his cell door, but unlike Del, he wasn't waving them</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">around. He simply held them out as far as he could, the hands at the ends of them open. It was a</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">purposeful pose, an almost urgent pose. And his voice, had the same quality, which was why, I suppose, I</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">didn't recognize it as belonging to Coffey at first. He seemed a different man from the lost, weepy soul</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="414" height="19" font="3">that had occupied this cell for the last few weeks.</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="493" height="19" font="3">&#34;Give im to me, Mr. Edgecombe! While there's still time!&#34;</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Then I remembered what he'd done for me, and understood. I supposed it couldn't hurt, but I didn't think</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">it would do much good, either. When I picked the mouse up, I winced at the feel-there were so many</text>
</page>
<page number="105" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">splintered bones poking at various spots on Mr. Jingles's hide that it was like picking up a fur-covered</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="408" height="19" font="3">pincushion. This was no urinary infection. Still -</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;What are you doing?&#34; Brutal asked as I put Mr. Jingles in Coffey's huge right hand. &#34;What the hell?&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Coffey pulled the mouse back through the bars. He lay limp on Coffey's palm, tail hanging over the arc</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">between Coffey's thumb and first finger, the tip twitching weakly in midair. Then Coffey covered his</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">right hand with his left, creating a kind of cup in which the mouse lay. We could no longer see Mr.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Jingles himself, only the tail, hanging down and twitching at the tip like a dying pendulum. Coffey lifted</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">his hands toward his face, spreading the fingers of the right as he did so, creating spaces like those</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">between prison bars. The tail of the mouse now hung from the side of his hands that was facing us.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">Brutal stepped next to me, still holding the colored spool between his fingers. &#34;What's he think he's</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="66" height="19" font="3">doing?&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="112" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shh,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Delacroix had stopped screaming. &#34;Please, John,&#34; he whispered. &#34;Oh Johnny, help him, please help him,</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="152" height="19" font="3">oh <i>s'il vous plait.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Dean and Harry joined us, Harry with our old deck of Airplane cards still in one hand. &#34;What's going</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">on?&#34; Dean asked, but I only shook my head. I was feeling hypnotized again, damned if I wasn't.</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Coffey put his mouth between two of his fingers and inhaled sharply. For a moment everything hung</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">suspended. Then he raised his head away from his hands and I saw the face of a man who looked</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">desperately sick, or in terrible pain. His eyes were sharp and blazing; his upper teeth bit at his full lower</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">lip; his dark face had faded to an unpleasant color that looked like ash stirred into mud. He made a</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="312" height="19" font="3">choked sound way back in his throat.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dear Jesus Lord and Savior,&#34; Brutal whispered. His eyes appeared to be in danger of dropping right out</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="93" height="19" font="3">of his face.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">&#34;What?&#34; Harry almost barked. <i>&#34;What?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="313" height="19" font="3">&#34;The tail! Don't you see it? The <i>tail!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles's tail was no longer a dying pendulum; it was snapping briskly from side to side, like the tail</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">of a cat in a bird-catching mood. And then, from inside Coffey's cupped hands, came a perfectly familiar</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">squeak.</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">Coffey made that choking, gagging sound again, then turned his head to one side like a man that has</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">coughed up a wad of phlegm and means to spit it out. Instead, he exhaled a cloud of black insects - I</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="4"><i>think</i> they were insects, and the others said the same, but to this day I am not sure - from his mouth and</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="710" height="19" font="3">nose. They boiled around him in a dark cloud that temporarily obscured his features.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="506" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ, what're those?&#34; Dean asked in a shrill, scared voice.</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="791" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's all right,&#34; I heard myself say. &#34;Don't panic, it's all right, in a few seconds they'll be gone.&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">As when Coffey had cured my urinary infection for me, the &#34;bugs&#34; turned white and then disappeared.</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="251" height="19" font="3">&#34;Holy shit,&#34; Harry whispered.</text>
</page>
<page number="106" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul?&#34; Brutal asked in an unsteady voice. &#34;Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Coffey looked okay again - like a fellow who has successfully coughed up a wad of meat that has been</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">choking him. He bent down, put his cupped hands on the floor, peeked through his fingers, then opened</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">them. Mr. Jingles, absolutely all right-not a single twist to his backbone, not a single lump poking at his</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">hide - ran out. He paused for a moment at the door of Coffey's cell, then ran across the Green Mile to</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="715" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's cell. As he went, I noticed there were still beads of blood in his whiskers.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Delacroix gathered him up, laughing and crying at the same time, covering the mouse with shameless,</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">smacking kisses. Dean and Harry and Brutal watched with silent wonder. Then Brutal stepped forward</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">and handed the colored spool through the bars. Delacroix didn't see it at first; he was too taken up with</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles. He was like a father whose son has been saved from drowning. Brutal tapped him on the</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">shoulder with the spool. Delacroix looked, saw it, took it, and went back to Mr. Jingles again, stroking</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">his fur and devouring him with his eyes, needing to constantly refresh his perception that yes, the mouse</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">was all right, the mouse was whole and fine and all right.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="423" height="19" font="3">&#34;Toss it,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I want to see how he runs.&#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="456" height="19" font="3">&#34;He all right, Boss Howell, he all right, praise God--!&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="363" height="19" font="3">&#34;Toss it,&#34; Brutal repeated. &#34;Mind me, Del.&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Delacroix bent, clearly reluctant, clearly not wanting to let Mr. Jingles out of his hands again, at least not</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">yet. Then, very gently, he tossed the spool. It rolled across the cell, past the Corona cigar box, and to the</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">wall. Mr. Jingles was after it, but not quite with the speed he had shown previously. He appeared to be</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">limping just a bit on his left rear leg, and that was what struck me the hardest - it was, I suppose, what</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="241" height="19" font="3">made it real. That little limp.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">He got to the spool, though, got to it just fine and nosed it back to Delacroix with all his old enthusiasm. I</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">turned to John Coffey, who was standing at his cell door and smiling. It was a tired smile, and not what</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">I'd call really happy, but the sharp urgency I'd seen in his face as he begged for the mouse to be given to</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">him was gone, and so was the look of pain and fear, as if he were choking. It was our john Coffey again,</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="492" height="19" font="3">with his not-quite-there face and strange, far-looking eyes.</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="387" height="19" font="3">&#34;You helped it,&#34; I said. &#34;Didn't you, big boy?&#34;</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right,&#34; Coffey said. The smile widened a little, and for a moment or two it was happy. &#34;I helped</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="690" height="19" font="3">it. I helped Del's mouse. I helped ...&#34; He trailed off, unable to remember the name.</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mr. Jingles,&#34; Dean said. He was looking at John with careful, wondering eyes, as if he expected Coffey</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="456" height="19" font="3">to burst into flames or maybe begin to float in his cell.</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="720" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right,&#34; Coffey said. &#34;Mr. Jingles. He's a circus mouse. Goan live in ivy-glass.&#34;</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;You bet your bobcat,&#34; Harry said, joining us in looking at John Coffey. Behind us, Delacroix lay down</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">on his bunk with Mr. Jingles on his chest. Del was crooning to him, singing him some French song that</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="190" height="19" font="3">sounded like a lullaby.</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Coffey looked up the Green Mile toward the duty desk and the door which led into my office and the</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">storage room beyond. &#34;Boss Percy's bad,&#34; he said. &#34;Boss Percy's mean. He stepped on Del's mouse. He</text>
</page>
<page number="107" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="204" height="19" font="3">stepped on Mr. Jingles.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">And then, before we could say anything else to him - if we could have thought of anything to say - John</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="665" height="19" font="3">Coffey went back to his bunk, lay down, and rolled on his side to face the wall.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>3.</b></text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">Percy was standing with his back to us when Brutal and I came into the storage room about twenty</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">minutes later. He had found a can of paste furniture polish on a shelf above the hamper where we put our</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">dirty uniforms (and, sometimes, our civilian clothes; the prison laundry didn't care what it washed), and</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">was polishing the oak arms and legs of the electric chair. This probably sounds bizarre to you, perhaps</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">even macabre, but to Brutal and me, it seemed the most normal thing Percy had done all night. Old</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">Sparky would be meeting his public tomorrow, and. Percy would at least appear to be in charge.</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="190" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy,&#34; I said quietly.</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">He turned the little tune he'd been humming dying in his throat, and looked at us. I didn't see the fear I'd</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">expected, at least not at first. I realized that Percy looked older, somehow. And, I thought, John Coffey</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">was right. He looked mean. Meanness is like an addicting drug - no one on earth is more qualified to say</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">that than me - and I thought that, after a certain amount of experimentation, Percy had gotten hooked on</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">it. He liked what he had done to Delacroix's mouse. What he liked even more was Delacroix's dismayed</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="73" height="19" font="3">screams.</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't start in on me,&#34; he said in a tone of voice that was almost pleasant. &#34;I mean, hey, it was just a</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="612" height="19" font="3">mouse. It never belonged here in the first place, as you boys well know.&#34;</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;The mouse is fine,&#34; I said. My heart was thumping hard in my chest but I made my voice come out</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">mild, almost disinterested. &#34;Just fine. Running and squeaking and chasing its spool again. You're no</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="706" height="19" font="3">better at mouse-killing than you are at most of the other things you do around here.&#34;</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">He was looking at me, amazed and disbelieving. &#34;You expect me to believe that? The goddam thing</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="4"><i>crunched!</i> I heard it! So you can just---!&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="87" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up.&#34;</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="552" height="19" font="3">He stared at me, his eyes wide. &#34;What? What did you say to me?&#34;</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="806" height="19" font="3">I took a step closer to him. I could feel a vein throbbing in the middle of my forehead. I couldn't</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">remember the last time I'd felt so angry. &#34;Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay? After all the talks we've</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">had about how our job is to keep the prisoners calm, especially when it gets near the end for them, I</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="725" height="19" font="3">thought you'd be glad. Relieved. With Del having to take the walk tomorrow, and all.&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Percy looked from me to Brutal, his studied calmness dissolving into uncertainty. &#34;What the hell game</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="377" height="19" font="3">do you boys think you're playing?&#34; he asked.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;None of this is a game, my friend,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;You thinking it is ... well, that's just one of the reasons</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="764" height="19" font="3">you can't be trusted. You want to know the absolute truth? I think you're a pretty sad case.&#34;</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;You want to watch it,&#34; Percy said. Now there was a rawness in his voice. Fear creeping back in, after all</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">- fear of what we might want with him, fear of what we might be up to. I was glad to hear it. It would</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="550" height="19" font="3">make him easier to deal with. &#34;I know people. Important people.&#34;</text>

<page number="108" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;So you say, but you're such a dreamer,&#34; Brutal said. He sounded as if he was on the verge of laughter.</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">Percy dropped the polishing rag onto the seat of the chair with the clamps attached to the arms and legs.</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="548" height="19" font="3">&#34;I killed that mouse,&#34; he said in a voice that was not quite steady.</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="499" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go on and check for yourself,&#34; I said. &#34;It's a free country.&#34;</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="209" height="19" font="3">&#34;I will,&#34; he said. &#34;I will.&#34;</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">He stalked past us, mouth set, small hands (Wharton was right, they <i>were </i>pretty) fiddling with his comb.</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">He went up the steps and ducked through into my office. Brutal and I stood by Old Sparky, waiting for</text>
<text top="275" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">him to come back and not talking. I don't know about Brutal, but I couldn't think of a thing to say. I didn't</text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="450" height="19" font="3">even know how to think about what we had just seen.</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Three minutes passed. Brutal picked up Percy's rag and began to polish the thick back-slats of the electric</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">chair. He had time to finish one and start another before Percy came back. He stumbled and almost fell</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">coming down the steps from the office to the storageroom floor, and when he crossed to us he came at an</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="440" height="19" font="3">uneven strut. His face was shocked and unbelieving.</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;You switched them,&#34; he said in a shrill, accusatory voice. &#34;You switched mice somehow, you bastards.</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">You're playing with me, and you're going to be goddam sorry if you don't stop! I'll see you on the</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="551" height="19" font="3">goddam breadlines if you don't stop! Who do you think you are?&#34;</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="398" height="19" font="3">He quit, panting for breath, his hands clenched.</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll tell you who we are,&#34; I said. &#34;We're the people you work with, Percy ... but not for very much</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">longer.&#34; I reached out and clamped my hands on his shoulders. Not real hard; but it was a clamp, all</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="143" height="19" font="3">right. Yes it was.</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="355" height="19" font="3">Percy reached up to break it. &#34;Take your-&#34;</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">Brutal grabbed his right hand - the whole thing, small and soft and white, disappeared into Brutal's</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">tanned fist. &#34;Shut up your cakehole, sonny. If you know what's good for you, you'll take this one last</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="374" height="19" font="3">opportunity to dig the wax out of your ears.&#34;</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">I turned him around, lifted him onto the platform, then backed him up until the backs of his knees struck</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">the seat of the electric chair and he had to sit down. His calm was gone; the meanness and the arrogance,</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">too. Those things were real enough, but you have to remember that Percy was very young. At his age</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">they were still only a thin veneer, like an ugly shade of enamel paint. You could still chip through. And I</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="356" height="19" font="3">judged that Percy was now ready to listen.</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="224" height="19" font="3">&#34;I want your word,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;My word about what?&#34; His mouth was still trying to sneer, but his eyes were terrified. The power in the</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">switch room was locked off, but Old Sparky's wooden seat had its own power, and right then I judged</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">that Percy was feeling it.</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your word that if we put you out front for it tomorrow night, you'll really go on to Briar Ridge and</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">leave us alone,&#34; Brutal said, speaking with a vehemence I had never heard from him before. &#34;That you'll</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="326" height="19" font="3">put in for a transfer the very next day.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="109" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;And if I won't? If I should just call up certain people and tell them you're harassing me and threatening</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">me? <i>Bullying</i> me?&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;We might get the bum's rush if your connections are as good as you seem to think they are,&#34; I said, &#34;but</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="616" height="19" font="3">we'd make sure you left your fair share of blood on the floor, too, Percy.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;About that mouse? Huh! You think anyone is going to care that I stepped on a condemned murderer's</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="392" height="19" font="3">pet mouse? Outside of this looneybin, that is?&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;No. But three men saw you just standing there with your thumb up your ass while Wild Bill Wharton</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">was trying to strangle Dean Stanton with his wrist-chains. About that people will care, Percy, I promise</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="602" height="19" font="3">you. About that even your offsides uncle the governor is going to care.&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Percy's cheeks and brow flushed a patchy red. &#34;You think they'd believe you?&#34; he asked, but his voice</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">had lost a lot of its angry force. Clearly <i>he </i>thought someone might believe us. And Percy didn't like</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="717" height="19" font="3">being in trouble. Breaking the rules was okay. Getting caught breaking them was not.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, I've got some photos of Dean's neck before the bruising went down,&#34; Brutal said - I had no idea if</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">this was true or not, but it certainly sounded good. &#34;You know what those pix say? That Wharton got a</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">pretty good shot at it before anyone pulled him off, although you were right there, and on Wharton's</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">blind side. You'd have some hard questions to answer, wouldn't you? And a thing like that could follow a</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">man for quite a spell. Chances are it'd still be there long after his relatives were out of the state capital</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">and back home drinking mint juleps on the front porch. A man's work-record can be a mighty interesting</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="676" height="19" font="3">thing, and a lot of people get a chance to look at it over the course of a lifetime.&#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Percy's eyes flicked back and forth mistrustfully between us. His left hand went to his hair and smoothed</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">it. He said nothing, but I thought we almost had him.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, let's quit this,&#34; I said. &#34;You don't want to be here any more than we want you here, isn't that</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="37" height="19" font="3">so?&#34;</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">&#34;I hate it here!&#34; he burst out. &#34;I hate the way you treat me, the way you never gave me a chance!&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="671" height="19" font="3">That last was far from true, but I judged this wasn't the time to argue the matter.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;But I don't like to be pushed around, either. My Daddy taught me that once you start down that road you</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">most likely end up letting people push you around your whole life.&#34; His eyes, not as pretty as his hands</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">but almost, flashed. &#34;I especially don't like being pushed around by big apes like this guy.&#34; He glanced at</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="618" height="19" font="3">my old friend and grunted. &#34;Brutal - you got the right nickname, at least.&#34;</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">&#34;You have to understand something, Percy,&#34; I said. &#34;The way we look at it, you've been pushing us</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">around. We keep telling you the way we do things around here and you keep doing things your own way,</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">then hiding behind your political connections when things turn out wrong. Stepping on Delacroix's</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">mouse---&#34; Brutal caught my eye and I backtracked in a hurry. &#34;Trying to step on Delacroix's mouse is</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">just a case in point. You push and push and push; we're finally pushing back, that's all. But listen, if you</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">do right, you'll come out of this looking good - like a young man on his way up - and smelling like a</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">rose. Nobody'll ever know about this little talk we're having. So what do you say? Act like a grownup.</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="264" height="19" font="3">Promise you'll leave after Del.&#34;</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">He thought it over. And after a moment or two, a look came into his eyes, the sort of look a fellow gets</text>
</page>
<page number="110" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">when he's just had a good idea. I didn't like it much, because any idea which seemed good to Percy</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="219" height="19" font="3">wouldn't seem good to us.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;If nothing else,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;just think how nice it'd be to get away from that sack of pus Wharton.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Percy nodded, and I let him get out of the chair. He straightened his uniform shirt, tucked it in at the</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">back, gave his hair a pass-through with his comb. Then he looked at us. &#34;Okay, I agree. I'm out front for</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">Del tomorrow night; I'll put in for Briar Ridge the very next day. We call it quits right there. Good</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">enough?&#34; &#34;Good enough,&#34; I said. That look was still in his eyes, but right then I was too relieved to care.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="613" height="19" font="3">He stuck out his hand. &#34;Shake on it?&#34; I did. So did Brutal. More fools us.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>4.</b></text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">The next day was the thickest yet, and the last of our strange October heat. Thunder was rumbling in the</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">west when I came to work, and the dark clouds were beginning to stack up there. They moved closer as</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">the night came down, and we could see blue-white forks of lightning jabbing out of them. There was a</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">tornado in Trapingus County around ten that night - it killed four people and tore the roof off the livery</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">stable in Tefton - and vicious thunderstorms and gale-force winds at Cold Mountain. Later it seemed to</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="630" height="19" font="3">me as if the very heavens had protested the bad death of Eduard Delacroix.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Everything went just fine to begin with. Del had spent a quiet day in his cell, sometimes playing with Mr.</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Jingles but mostly just lying on his bunk and petting him. Wharton tried to get trouble started a couple of</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">times - once he hollered down to Del about the mousieburgers they were going to have after old Lucky</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">Pierre was dancing the two-step in hell - but the little Cajun didn't respond and Wharton, apparently</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="355" height="19" font="3">deciding that was his best shot, gave it up.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">At quarter past ten, Brother Schuster showed up and delighted us all by saying he would recite the Lord's</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">Prayer with Del in Cajun French. It seemed like a good omen. In that we were wrong, of course.</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">The witnesses began to arrive around eleven, most talking in low tones about the impending weather, and</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">speculating about the possibility of a power outage postponing the electrocution. None of them seemed to</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">know that Old Sparky ran off a generator, and unless that took a direct lightning-hit, the show would go</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">on. Harry was in the switch room that night, so he and Bill Dodge and Percy Wetmore acted as ushers,</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">seeing folks into their seats and asking each one if he'd like a cold drink of water. There were two women</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">present: the sister of the girl Del had raped and murdered, and the mother of one of the fire victims. The</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">latter lady was large and pale and determined. She told Harry Terwilliger that she hoped the man she'd</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">come to see was good and scared, that he knew the fires in the furnace were stoked for him, and that</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Satan's imps, were waiting for him. Then she burst into tears and buried her face in a lace hanky that was</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="257" height="19" font="3">almost the size of a pillowslip.</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Thunder, hardly muffled at all by the tin roof, banged harsh and loud. People glanced up uneasily. Men</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">who looked uncomfortable wearing ties this late at night wiped at their florid cheeks. It was hotter than</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">blue blazes in the storage shed. And, of course, they kept turning their eyes to Old Sparky. They might</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">have made jokes about this chore earlier in the week, but the jokes were gone by eleven-thirty or so that</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">night. I started all this by telling you that the humor went out of the situation in a hurry for the people</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">who had to sit down in that oak chair, but the condemned prisoners weren't the only ones who lost the</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">smiles off their faces when the time actually came. It just seemed so <i>bald,</i> somehow, squatting up there</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">on its platform, with the clamps on the legs sticking off to either side, looking like the things a person</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">with polio would have to wear. There wasn't much talk, and when the thunder boomed again, as sharp</text>
</page>
<page number="111" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">and personal as a splintering tree, the sister of Delacroix's victim gave a little scream. The last person to</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="718" height="19" font="3">take his seat in the witness's section was Curtis Anderson, Warden Moores's stand-in.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">At eleven-thirty, I approached Delacroix's cell with Brutal and Dean walking slightly behind me. Del was</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">sitting on his bunk, with Mr. Jingles in his lap. The mouse's head was stretched forward toward the</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">condemned man, his little oilspot eyes rapt on Del's face. Del was stroking the top of Mr. Jingles's head</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">between his ears. Large silent tears were rolling down Del's face, and it was these the mouse seemed to</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">be peering at. Del looked up at the sound of our footsteps. He was very pale. From behind me, I sensed</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="3">rather than saw John Coffey standing at his cell door, watching.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Del winced at the sound of my keys clashing against metal, but held steady, continuing to stroke Mr.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="488" height="19" font="3">Jingles's head, as I turned the locks and ran the door open.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hi dere, Boss Edgecombe,&#34; he said. &#34;Hi dere, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles.&#34; But Mr. Jingles only continued</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">to look raptly up at the balding little man's face, as if wondering at the source of his tears. The colored</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">spool had been neatly laid aside in the Corona box - laid aside for the last time, I thought, and felt a pang.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="398" height="19" font="3">&#34;Eduard Delacroix, as an officer of the court...&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="172" height="19" font="3">&#34;Boss Edgecombe?&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="752" height="19" font="3">I thought about just running on with the set speech, then thought again. &#34;What is it, Del?&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="654" height="19" font="3">He held the mouse out to me. &#34;Here. Don't let nothing happen to Mr. Jingles.&#34;</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="400" height="19" font="3">&#34;Del, I don't think he'll come to me. He's not - &#34;</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mais oui, he say he will. He say he know all about you, Boss Edgecombe, and you gonna take him</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">down to dat place in Florida where the mousies do their tricks. He say he trust you.&#34; He held his hand out</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">farther, and I'll be damned if the mouse didn't step off his palm and onto my shoulder. It was so light I</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">couldn't even feel it through my uniform coat, but I sensed it, like a small heat. &#34;And boss? Don't let that</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="520" height="19" font="3">bad 'un near him again. Don't let that bad 'un hurt my mouse.&#34;</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, Del. I won't.&#34; The question was, what was I supposed to do with him right then? I couldn't very well</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">march Delacroix past the witnesses with a mouse perched on my shoulder.</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll take him, boss,&#34; a voice rumbled from behind me. It was John Coffey's voice, and it was eerie the</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">way it came right then, as though he had read my mind. &#34;Just for now. If Del don't mind.&#34;</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Del nodded, relieved. &#34;Yeah, you take im, John, 'til dis foolishment done - bien! And den after ...&#34; His</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">gaze shifted back to Brutal and me. &#34;You gonna take him down to Florida. To dat Mouseville Place.&#34;</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, most likely Paul and I will do it together,&#34; Brutal said, watching with a troubled and unquiet eye</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">as Mr. Jingles stepped off my shoulder and into Coffey's huge outstretched palm. Mr. Jingles did this</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">with no protest or attempt to run; indeed, he scampered as readily up John Coffey's arm as he had stepped</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="632" height="19" font="3">onto my shoulder. &#34;We'll take some of our vacation time. Won't we, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I nodded. Del nodded, too, eyes bright, just a trace of a smile on his lips. &#34;People pay a dime apiece to</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="552" height="19" font="3">see him. Two cents for the kiddies. Ain't dat right, Boss,Howell?&#34;</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="159" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right, Del.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="112" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;You a good man, Boss Howell,&#34; Del said. &#34;You, too, Boss Edgecombe. You yell at me sometimes, oui,</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">but not 'less you have to. You all good men except for dat Percy. I wish I coulda met you someplace else.</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="295" height="19" font="4"><i>Mauvais temps, mauvaise chance.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="125" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;I got something to say to you, Del,- I told him. &#34;They're just the words I have to say to everyone before</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">we walk. No big deal, but it's part of my job. Okay?&#34;</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Oui, monsieur,&#34;</i> he said, and looked at Mr. Jingles, perched on John Coffey's broad shoulder, for the last</text>
<text top="212" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">time. &#34;Au <i>revoir, mon ami,&#34;</i> he said, beginning to cry harder. <i>&#34;le t'aime, mon petit.&#34;</i> He blew the mouse a</text>
<text top="236" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">kiss. It should have been funny, that blown kiss, or maybe just grotesque, but it wasn't. I met Dean's eye</text>
<text top="260" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">for a moment, then had to look away. Dean stared down the corridor toward the restraint room and</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">smiled strangely I believe he was on the verge of tears. As for me, I said what I had to say, beginning</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">with the part about how I was an officer of the court, and when I was done, Delacroix stepped out of his</text>
<text top="332" left="15" width="173" height="19" font="3">cell for the last time.</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hold on a second longer, hoss,&#34; Brutal said, and checked the crown of Del's head, where the cap would</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">go. He nodded at me, then clapped Del on the shoulder. &#34;Right with Eversharp. We're on our way.&#34;</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">So Eduard Delacroix took his last walk on the Green Mile with little streams of mingled sweat and tears</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">running down his cheeks and big thunder rolling in the sky overhead. Brutal walked on the condemned</text>
<text top="482" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">man's left, I was on his right, Dean was to the rear.</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Schuster was in my office, with guards Ringgold and Battle standing in the corners and keeping watch.</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">Schuster looked up at Del, smiled, and then addressed him in French. It sounded stilted to me, but it</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">worked wonders. Del smiled back, then went to Schuster, put his arms around him, hugged him.</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="661" height="19" font="3">Ringgold and Battle tensed, but I raised my hands to them and shook my head.</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Schuster listened to Del's flood of tear-choked French, nodded as if he understood perfectly, and patted</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">him on the back. He looked at me over the little man's shoulder and said, &#34;I hardly understand a quarter</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="174" height="19" font="3">of what he's saying.&#34;</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="339" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't think it matters,&#34; Brutal rumbled.</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;Neither do I, son,&#34; Schuster said with a grin. He was the best of them, and now I realize I have no idea</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="558" height="19" font="3">what became of him. I hope he kept his faith, whatever else befell.</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="691" height="19" font="3">He urged Delacroix onto his knees, then folded his hands. Delacroix did the same.</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Not' Pere, qui etes aux cieux,&#34;</i> Schuster began, and Delacroix joined him. They spoke the Lord's Prayer</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">together in that liquid-sounding Cajun French, all the way to <i>&#34;mais deliverez-nous du mal, ainsi soit-il.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">By then, Del's tears had mostly stopped and he looked calm. Some Bible verses (in English) followed,</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">not neglecting the old standby about the still waters. When that was done, Schuster started to get up, but</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Del held onto the sleeve of his shirt and said something in French. Schuster listened carefully, frowning.</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="621" height="19" font="3">He responded. Del said something else, then just looked at him hopefully.</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">Schuster turned to me and said: &#34;He's got something else, Mr. Edgecombe. A prayer I can't help him</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="345" height="19" font="3">with, because of my faith. Is it all right?&#34;</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I looked at the clock on the wall and saw it was seventeen minutes to midnight. &#34;Yes,&#34; I said, &#34;but it'll</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="542" height="19" font="3">have to be quick. We've got a schedule to keep here, you know.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="113" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="44" left="15" width="472" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. I do.&#34; He turned to Delacroix and gave him a nod.</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Del closed his eyes as if to pray, but for a moment said nothing. A frown creased his forehead and I had a</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">sense of him reaching far back in his mind, as a man may search a small attic room for an object which</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">hasn't been used (or needed) for a long, long time. I glanced at the clock again and almost said something</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="593" height="19" font="3">- would have, if Brutal hadn't twitched my sleeve and shaken his head.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Then Del began, speaking softly but quickly in that Cajun which was as round and soft and sensual as a</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">young woman's breast: <i>&#34;Marie! le vous salue, Marie, oui, pleine de grace; le Seigneur est avec vous;</i></text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="4"><i>vous etes benie entre toutes les femmes, et mon cher Jesus, le fruit de vos entrailles, est beni.&#34; </i>He was</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">crying again, but I don't think he knew it. <i>&#34;Sainte Marie,</i>6 <i>ma mere, Mere de Dieu, priez pour moi, priez</i></text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="4"><i>pour nous, pauv' pecheurs, maint'ant et l'heure ... l'heure de notre mort. L'heure de mon mort.&#34;</i> He took a</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="332" height="19" font="3">deep, shuddering breath. <i>&#34;Ainsi soit-il.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Lightning spilled through the room's one window in a brief blue-white glare as Delacroix got to his feet.</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Everyone jumped and cringed except for Del himself; he still seemed lost in the old prayer. He reached</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">out with one hand, not looking to see where it went. Brutal took it and squeezed it briefly. Delacroix</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">looked at him and smiled a little. &#34;Nous <i>voyons - &#34;</i> he began, then stopped. With a conscious effort, he</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">switched back to English. &#34;We can go now, Boss Howell, Boss Edgecombe. I'm right wit God,&#34;</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's good,&#34; I said, wondering how right with God Del was going to feel twenty minutes from now,</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">when he stood on the other side of the electricity. I hoped his last prayer had been heard, and that Mother</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Mary was praying for him with all her heart and soul, because Eduard Delacroix, rapist and murderer,</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">right then needed all the praying he could get his hands on. Outside, thunder bashed across the sky again.</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="252" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, Del. Not far now.&#34;</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Fine, boss, dat fine. Because I ain't ascairt no more.&#34; So he said, but I saw in his eyes that - Our Father</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">or no Our Father, Hail Mary or no Hail Mary - he lied. By the time they cross the rest of the green carpet</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="523" height="19" font="3">and duck through the little door, almost all of them are scared.</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Stop at the bottom, Del,&#34; I told him in a low voice as he went through, but it was advice I needn't have</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">given him. He stopped at the foot of the stairs, all right, stopped cold, and what did it was the sight of</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Percy Wetmore standing there on the platform, with the sponge-bucket by one foot and the phone that</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="450" height="19" font="3">went to the governor just visible beyond his right hip.</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="527" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Non,&#34;</i> Del said in a low, horrified voice. <i>&#34;Non, non,</i> not him!&#34;</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="758" height="19" font="3">&#34;Walk on,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;You just keep your eyes on me and Paul. Forget he's there at all.&#34;</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="54" height="19" font="3">&#34;But-&#34;</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">People had turned to look at us, but by moving my body a bit, I could still grip Delacroix's left elbow</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">without being seen. &#34;Steady,&#34; I said in a voice only Del - and perhaps Brutal - could hear. &#34;The only</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">thing most of these people will remember about you is how you go out, so give them something good.&#34;</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">The loudest crack of thunder yet broke overhead at that moment, loud enough to make the storage room's</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">tin roof vibrate. Percy jumped as if someone had goosed him, and Del gave a small, contemptuous snort</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">of laughter. &#34;It get much louder dan dat, he gonna piddle in his pants again,&#34; he said, and then squared</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="636" height="19" font="3">his shoulders - not that he had much to square. &#34;Come on. Let's get it over.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="114" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">We walked to the platform. Delacroix ran a nervous eye over the witnesses - about twenty-five of them</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">this time - as we went, but Brutal, Dean, and I kept our own eyes trained on the chair. All looked in order</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">to me. I raised one thumb and a questioning eyebrow to Percy, who gave a little one-sided grimace, as if</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="543" height="19" font="3">to say <i>What do you mean, is everything all right? Of course it is.</i></text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="177" height="19" font="3">I hoped he was right.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Brutal and I reached automatically for Delacroix's elbows as he stepped up onto the platform. It's only</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">eight or so inches up from the floor, but you'd be surprised how many of them, even the toughest of</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="524" height="19" font="3">tough babies, need help to make that last step up of their lives.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Del did okay, though. He stood in front of the chair for a moment (resolutely not looking at Percy), then</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">actually spoke to it, as if introducing himself: <i>&#34;C'est</i> moi,&#34; he said. Percy reached for him, but Delacroix</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">turned around on his own and sat down. I knelt on what was now his left side, and Brutal knelt on his</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">right. I guarded my crotch and my throat in the manner I have already described, then swung the clamp</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">in so that its open jaws encircled the skinny white flesh just above the Cajun's ankle. Thunder bellowed</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">and I jumped. Sweat ran in my eye, stinging. Mouseville, I kept thinking for some reason. Mouseville,</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">and how it cost a dime to get in. Two cents for the kiddies, who would look at Mr. Jingles through his</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="162" height="19" font="3">ivy-glass windows.</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">The clamp was balky, wouldn't shut. I could hear Del breathing in great dry pulls of air, lungs that would</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">be charred bags less than four minutes from now laboring to keep up with his fear-driven heart. The fact</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">that he had killed half a dozen people seemed at that moment the least important thing about him. I'm not</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="652" height="19" font="3">trying to say anything about right and wrong here, but only to tell how it was.</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="514" height="19" font="3">Dean knelt next to me and whispered, &#34;What's wrong, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;I can't--&#34; I began, and then the clamp closed with an audible snapping sound. It must have also pinched</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">a fold of Delacroixs skin in its jaws, because he flinched and made a little hissing noise. &#34;Sorry,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="496" height="19" font="3">&#34;It okay, boss,&#34; Del said. &#34;It only gonna hurt for a minute.&#34;</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Brutal's side had the clamp with the electrode in it, which always took a little longer, and so we stood up,</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">all three of us, at almost exactly the same time. Dean reached for the wrist-clamp on Del's left, and Percy</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">went to the one on his right. I was ready to move forward if Percy should need help, but he did better</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">with his wrist-clamp than I'd done with my ankle-clamp. I could see Del trembling all over now, as if a</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">low current were already passing through him. I could smell his sweat, too. It was sour and strong and</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="290" height="19" font="3">reminded me of weak pickle juice.</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Dean nodded to Percy. Percy turned back over his shoulder - I could see a place just under the angle of</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="788" height="19" font="3">his jaw where he'd cut himself shaving that day - and said in a low, firm voice: &#34;Roll on one!&#34;</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">There was a hum, sort of like the sound an old refrigerator makes when it kicks on, and the hanging</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">lights in the storage room brightened. There were a few low gasps and murmurs from the audience. Del</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">jerked in the chair, his hands gripping the ends of the oak arms hard enough to turn the knuckles white.</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">His eyes rolled rapidly from side to side in their sockets, and his dry breathing quickened even more. He</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="209" height="19" font="3">was almost panting now.</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">&#34;Steady,&#34; Brutal murmured. &#34;Steady, Del, you're doing just fine. Hang on, you're doing just fine.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="115" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="4"><i>Hey you guys! I</i> thought. <i>Come and see what Mr. Jingles can do! </i>And overhead, the thunder banged</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="51" height="19" font="3">again.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Percy stepped grandly around to the front of the electric chain This was his big moment, he was at center</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">stage, all eyes were on him. All, that was, but for one set. Delacroix saw who it was and looked down at</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">his lap instead. I would have bet you a dollar to a doughnut that Percy would flub his lines when he</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">actually had to say them for an audience, but he reeled them off without a hitch, in an eerily calm voice.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Eduard Delacroix, you have been condemned to die in the electric chair, sentence passed by a jury of</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">your peers and imposed by a judge of good standing in this state, God save the people of this state. Do</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">you have anything to say before sentence is carried out?&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Del tried to speak and at first nothing came out but a terrified whisper full of air and vowel-sounds. The</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">shadow of a contemptuous smile touched the corners of Percy's lips, and I could have cheerfully shot him</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="433" height="19" font="3">right there. Then Del licked his lips and tried again.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">&#34; I sorry for what I do,&#34; he said. &#34;I give anything to turn back the clock, but no one can. So now - &#34;</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Thunder exploded like an airburst mortar shell above us. Del jumped as much as the clamps would allow,</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">eyes starting wildly out of his wet face. &#34;So now I pay the price. God forgive me.&#34; He licked his lips</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">again, and looked at Brutal. &#34;Don't forget your promise about Mr. Jingles,&#34; he said in a lower voice that</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="184" height="19" font="3">was meant just for us.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">&#34;We won't, don't worry,&#34; I said, and patted Delacroix's clay-cold hand. &#34;He's going to Mouseville - &#34;</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;The hell he is' &#34; Percy said, speaking from the corner of his mouth like a yardwise con as he hooked the</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">restraining belt across Delacroix's chest. &#34;There's no such place. It's a fairy-tale these guys made up to</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="464" height="19" font="3">keep you quiet. Just thought you should know, faggot.&#34;</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">A stricken light in Del's eyes told me that part of him <i>had</i> known ... but would have kept the knowledge</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">from the rest of him, if allowed. I looked at Percy, dumbfounded and furious, and he looked back at me</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">levelly, as if to ask what I meant to do about it. And he had me, of course. There was nothing I <i>could</i> do</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">about it, not in front of the witnesses, not with Delacroix now sitting on the furthest edge of life. There</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="416" height="19" font="3">was nothing to do now but go on with it, finish it.</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Percy took the mask from its hook and rolled it down over Del's face, snugging it tight under the little</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">man's undershot chin so as to stretch the hole in the top. Taking the sponge from the bucket and putting it</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">in the cap was the next, and it was here that Percy diverged from the routine for the first time: instead of</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">just bending over and fishing the sponge out, he took the steel cap from the back of the chair, and bent</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">over with it in his hands. Instead of bringing the sponge to the cap, in other words-which would have</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">been the natural way to do it - he brought the cap to the sponge. I should have realized something was</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">wrong, but I was too upset. It was the only execution I ever took part in where I felt totally out of control.</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">As for Brutal, he never looked at Percy at all, not as Percy bent over the bucket (moving so as to partially</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">block what he was doing from our view), not as he straightened up and turned to Del with the cap in his</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">hands and the brown circle of sponge already inside it. Brutal was looking at the cloth which had</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">replaced Del's face, watching the way the black silk mask drew in, outlining the circle of Del's open</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">mouth, and then puffed out again with his breath. There were big beads of perspiration on Brutal's</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">forehead, and at his temples, just below the hairline. I had never seen him sweat at an execution before.</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="794" height="19" font="3">Behind him, Dean looked distracted and W, as if he was fighting not to lose his supper. We all</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">understood that something was wrong, I know that now. We just couldn't tell what it was. No one knew -</text>
</page>
<page number="116" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">not then - about the questions Percy had been asking Jack Van Hay. There were a lot of them, but I</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">suspect most were just camouflage. What Percy wanted to know about - the <i>only</i> thing Percy wanted to</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">know about, I believe - was the sponge. The purpose of the sponge. Why it was soaked in brine ... and</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="408" height="19" font="3">what would happen if it was not soaked in brine.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="359" height="19" font="3">What would happen if the sponge was dry.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Percy jammed the cap down on Del's head. The little man jumped and moaned again, this time louder.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Some of the witnesses stirred uneasily on their folding chairs. Dean took a half-step forward, meaning to</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">help with the chin-strap, and Percy motioned him curtly to step back. Dean did, hunching a little and</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">wincing as another blast of thunder shook the storage shed. This time it was followed by the first spatters</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">of rain across the roof. They sounded hard, like someone flinging handfuls of goobers onto a washboard.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">You've heard people say &#34;My blood ran cold&#34; about things, haven't you? Sure. All of us have, but the</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">only time in all my years that I actually felt it happen to me was on that new and thunderstruck morning</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">in October of 1932, at about ten seconds past midnight. It wasn't the look of poison triumph on Percy</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Wetmore's face as he stepped away from the capped, clamped, and hooded figure sitting there in Old</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Sparky; it was what I should have seen and didn't. There was no water running down Del's cheeks from</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="379" height="19" font="3">out of the cap. That was when I finally got it.</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Edward Delacroix,&#34; Percy was saying, &#34;electricity shall now be passed through your body until you are</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">dead, according to state law.&#34;</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">I looked over at Brutal in an agony that made my urinary infection seem like a bumped finger The</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">sponge is dry! I mouthed at him, but he only shook his head, not understanding, and looked back at the</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">mask over the Frenchman's face, where the man's last few breaths were pulling the black silk in and then</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="177" height="19" font="3">blousing it out again.</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I reached for Percy's elbow and he stepped away from me, giving me a flat look as he did so. It was only</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">a momentary glance, but it told me everything. Later he would tell his lies and his half-truths, and most</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">would be believed by the people who mattered, but I knew a different story. Percy was a good student</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">when he was doing something he cared about, we'd found that out at the rehearsals, and he had listened</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">carefully when Jack Van Hay explained how the brine-soaked sponge conducted the juice, channelling it,</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">turning the charge into a kind of electric bullet to the brain. Oh yes, Percy knew exactly what he was</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">doing. I think I believed him later when he said I didn't know how far it would go, but that doesn't even</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">count in the good-intentions column, does it? I don't think so. Yet, short of screaming in front of the</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">assistant warden and all the witnesses for Jack Van Hay not to pull the switch, there was nothing I could</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">do. Given another five seconds, I think I might have screamed just that, but Percy didn't give me another</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="110" height="19" font="3">five seconds.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;May God have mercy on your soul,&#34; he told the panting, terrified figure in the electric chair, then looked</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">past him at the mesh-covered rectangle where Harry and Jack were standing, Jack with his hand on the</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">switch marked MABEL'S HAIR DRIER. The doctor was standing to the right of that window, eyes fixed</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="697" height="19" font="3">on the black bag between his feet, as silent and selfeffacing as ever. &#34;Roll on two!&#34;</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">At first it was the same as always - the humming that was a little louder than the original cycle-up, but</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="679" height="19" font="3">not much, and the mindless forward surge of Del's body as his muscles spasmed.</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="278" height="19" font="3">Then things started going wrong.</text>
</page>
<page number="117" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="44" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">The humming lost its steadiness and began to waver. It was joined by a crackling sound, like cellophane</text>
<text top="68" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">being crinkled. I could smell something horrible that I didn't identify as a mixture of burning hair and</text>
<text top="92" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">organic sponge until I saw blue tendrils of smoke curling out from beneath the edges of the cap. More</text>
<text top="116" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">smoke was streaming out of the hole in the top of the cap that the wire came in through; it looked like</text>
<text top="140" left="15" width="432" height="19" font="3">smoke coming out of the hole in an Indian's teepee.</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Delacroix began to jitter and twist in-the chair, his mask-covered face snapping from side to side as if in</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">some vehement refusal. His legs began to piston up and down in short strokes that were hampered by the</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="792" height="19" font="3">clamps on his ankles. Thunder banged overhead, and now the rain began to pour down harder.</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I looked at Dean Stanton; he stared wildly back. There was a muffled pop from under the cap, like a pine</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">knot exploding in a hot fire, and now I could see smoke coming through the mask, as well, seeping out in</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="90" height="19" font="3">little curls.</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">I lunged toward the mesh between us and the switch room, but before I could open my mouth, Brutus</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Howell seized my elbow. His grip was hard enough to make the nerves in there tingle. He was as white</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">as tallow but not in a panic - not even close to being in a panic. &#34;Don't you tell Jack to stop,&#34; he said in a</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="583" height="19" font="3">low voice. &#34;Whatever you do, don't tell him that. It's too late to stop.&#34;</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">At first, when Del began to scream, the witnesses didn't hear him. The rain on the tin roof had swelled to</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">a roar, and the thunder was damned near continuous. But those of us on the platform heard him, all right</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">- choked howls of pain from beneath the smoking mask, sounds an animal caught and mangled in a</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="190" height="19" font="3">hay-baler might make.</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">The hum from the cap was ragged and wild now, broken by bursts of what sounded like radio static.</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Delacroix began to slam back and forth in the chair like a kid doing a tantrum. The platform shook, and</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">he hit the leather restraining belt almost hard enough to pop it. The current was also twisting him from</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">side to side, and I heard the crunching snap as his right shoulder either broke or dislocated. It went with a</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">sound like someone hitting a wooden crate with a sledgehammer. The crotch of his pants, no more than a</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">blur because of the short pistoning strokes of his legs, darkened. Then he began to squeal, horrible</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="707" height="19" font="3">sounds, high-pitched and ratlike, that were audible even over the rushing downpour.</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="436" height="19" font="3">&#34;What the hell's happening to him?&#34; someone cried.</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="290" height="19" font="3">&#34;Are those clamps going to hold?&#34;</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="220" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ, the <i>smell!</i> Phew!&#34;</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="395" height="19" font="3">Then, one of the two women: &#34;Is this normal?&#34;</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Delacroix snapped forward, dropped back, snapped forward, fell back. Percy was staring at him with</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="556" height="19" font="3">slack-jawed horror. He had expected <i>something,</i> sure, but not this.</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">The mask burst into flame on Delacroix's face. The smell of cooking hair and sponge was now joined by</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">the smell of cooking flesh. Brutal grabbed the bucket the sponge had been in - it was empty now, of</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="558" height="19" font="3">course - and charged for the extra-deep janitor's sink in the corner.</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shouldn't I kill the juice, Paul?&#34; Van Hay called through the mesh. He sounded completely rattled.</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="104" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shouldn't-&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="118" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;No!&#34; I shouted back. Brutal had understood it first, but I hadn't been far behind: we had to finish it.</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Whatever else we might do in all the rest of our lives was secondary to that one thing: we had to finish</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="470" height="19" font="3">with Delacroix. &#34;Roll, for Christ's sake! Roll, roll, roll!&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">I turned to Brutal, hardly aware of the people talking behind us now, some on their feet, a couple</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="670" height="19" font="3">screaming. <i>&#34;Quit that!&#34;</i> I yelled at Brutal. &#34;No <i>water!</i> No <i>water! Are you nuts?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Brutal turned toward me, a kind of dazed understanding on his face. Throw water on a man who was</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">getting the juice. Oh yes. That would be very smart. He looked around, saw the chemical fire</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="549" height="19" font="3">extinguisher hanging on the wall, and got that instead. Good boy.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">The mask had peeled away from Delacroix's face enough to reveal features that had gone blacker than</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">John Coffey's. His eyes, now nothing but misshapen globs of white, filmy jelly, had been blown out of</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">their sockets and lay on his cheeks. His eyelashes were gone, and as I looked, the lids themselves caught</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">fire and began to burn. Smoke puffed from the open V of his shirt. And still the humming of the</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">electricity went on and on, filling my head, vibrating in there. I think it's the sound mad people must</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="253" height="19" font="3">hear, that or something like it.</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Dean started forward, thinking in some dazed way that he could beat the fire out of Del's shirt with his</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">hands, and I yanked him away almost hard enough to pull him off his feet. Touching Delacroix at that</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">point would have been like Brer Rabbit punching into the Tar-Baby. An electrified Tar-Baby, in this</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="41" height="19" font="3">case.</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">I still didn't turn around to see what was going on behind us, but it sounded like pandemonium, chairs</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">falling over, people bellowing, a woman crying <i>&#34;Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see he's had enough?&#34;</i> at the</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">top of her lungs. Curtis Anderson grabbed my shoulder and asked what was happening, for Christ's sake,</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="531" height="19" font="3">what was happening, and why didn't I order jack to shut down?</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;Because I can't,&#34; I said. &#34;We've gone too far to turn back, can't you see that? It'll be over in a few more</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="156" height="19" font="3">seconds, anyway.&#34;</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">But it was at least two minutes before it was over, the longest two minutes of my whole life, and through</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">most of it I think Delacroix was conscious. He screamed and jittered and rocked from side to side. Smoke</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">poured from his nostrils and from a mouth that had gone the purple-black of ripe plums. Smoke drifted</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">up from his tongue the way smoke rises from a hot griddle. All the buttons on his shirt either burst or</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">melted. His undershirt did not quite catch fire, but it charred and smoke poured through it and we could</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">smell his chest-hair roasting. Behind us, people were heading for the door like cattle in a stampede. They</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">couldn't get out through it, of course - we were in a damn prison, after all - so they simply clustered</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">around it while Delacroix fried <i>(Now I'm fryin,</i> Old Toot had said when we were rehearsing for Arlen</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Bitterbuck, <i>I'm a done tom turkey)</i> and the thunder rolled and the rain ran down out of the sky in a perfect</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="40" height="19" font="3">fury.</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">At some point I thought of the doc and looked around for him. He was still there, but crumpled on the</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">floor beside his black bag. He'd fainted.</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="559" height="19" font="3">Brutal came up and stood beside me, holding the fire extinguisher.</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="141" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not yet,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="81" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know.&#34;</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">We looked around for Percy and saw him standing almost behind Sparky now, frozen, eyes huge, one</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="282" height="19" font="3">knuckle crammed into his mouth.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">Then, at last, Delacroix slumped back in the chair, his bulging, misshapen face lying over on one</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">shoulder. He was still jittering, but we'd seen this before; it was the current running through him. The cap</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">had come askew on his head, but when we took it off a little later, most of his scalp and his remaining</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="678" height="19" font="3">fringe of hair came with it, bonded to the metal as if by some powerful adhesive.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Kill it!&#34; I called to Jack when thirty seconds had gone by with nothing but electric jitters coming from</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the smoking, man-shaped lump of charcoal lolling in the electric chair. The hum died immediately, and I</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="146" height="19" font="3">nodded to Brutal.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">He turned and slammed the fire extinguisher into Percy's arms so hard that Percy staggered backward and</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">almost fell off the platform. &#34;You do it,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;You're running the show, after all, ain't you?&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Percy gave him a look that was both sick and murderous, then armed the extinguisher, pumped it, cocked</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">it, and shot a huge cloud of white foam over the man in the chair. I saw Del's foot twitch once as the</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">spray hit his face and thought <i>Oh no, we might have to go again,</i> but there was only that single twitch.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Anderson had turned around and was bawling at the panicky witnesses, telling them everything was all</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">right, everything was under control, just a powersurge from the electrical storm, nothing to worry about.</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Next thing, he'd be telling them that what they smelled - a devil's mixture of burned hair, fried meat, and</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="307" height="19" font="3">fresh-baked shit - was Chanel No. 5.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get doc's stethoscope,&#34; I told Dean as the extinguisher ran dry. Delacroix was coated with white now,</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="691" height="19" font="3">and the worst of the stench was being overlaid by a thin and bitter chemical smell.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="173" height="19" font="3">&#34;Doc ... should I .. .&#34;</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">&#34;Never mind doc, just get his stethoscope,&#34; I said. &#34;Let's get this over ... get him out of here.&#34;</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Dean nodded. <i>Over</i> and <i>out of here</i> were two concepts that appealed to him just then. They appealed to</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">both of us. He went over to doc's bag and began rummaging in it. Doc was beginning to move again, so</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">at least he hadn't had a stroke or a heart-storm. That was good. But the way Brutal was looking at Percy</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="58" height="19" font="3">wasn't.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="469" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get down in the tunnel and wait by the gurney,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="406" height="19" font="3">Percy swallowed. &#34;Paul, listen. I didn't know---&#34;</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="539" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up. Get down in the tunnel and wait by the gurney. Now.&#34;</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">He swallowed, grimaced as if it hurt, and then walked toward the door which led to the stairs and the</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">tunnel. He carried the empty fire extinguisher in his arms, as if it were a baby Dean passed him, coming</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">back to me with the stethoscope. I snatched it and set the earpieces. I'd done this before, in the army, and</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="387" height="19" font="3">it's sort of like riding a bike - you don't forget.</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I wiped at the foam on Delacroix's chest, then had to gag back vomit as a large, hot section of his skin</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">simply slid away from the flesh beneath, the way the skin will slide off a ... well, you know. A done tom</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="59" height="19" font="3">turkey.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh my God&#34;' a voice I didn't recognize almost sobbed behind me. &#34;Is it always this way? Why didn't</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="392" height="19" font="3">somebody tell me? I never would have come!&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="4"><i>Too late now, friend, I</i> thought. &#34;Get that man out of here,&#34; I said to Dean or Brutal or whoever might be</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">listening - I said it when I was sure I could speak without puking into Delacroix's smoking lap. &#34;Get them</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="181" height="19" font="3">all back by the door.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">I steeled myself as best I could, then put the disc of the stethoscope on the red-black patch of raw flesh</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">I'd made on Del's chest. I listened, praying I would hear nothing, and that's just what I did hear.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="217" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's dead,&#34; I told Brutal.</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="133" height="19" font="3">&#34;Thank Christ.&#34;</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. Thank Christ. You and Dean get the stretcher. Let's unbuckle him and get him out of here, fast.&#34;</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>5.</b></text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">We got his body down the twelve stairs and onto the gurney all right. My nightmare was that his cooked</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">flesh might slough right off his bones as we lugged him - it was Old Toot's done tom turkey that had</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="455" height="19" font="3">gotten into my head - but of course that didn't happen.</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Curtis Anderson was upstairs soothing the spectators -trying to, anyway - and that was good for Brutal,</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">because Anderson wasn't there to see when Brutal took a step toward the head of the gurney and pulled</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">his arm back to slug Percy, who was standing there looking stunned. I caught his arm, and that was good</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">for both of them. It was good for Percy because Brutal meant to deliver a blow of near-decapitory force,</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">and good for Brutal because he would have lost his job if the blow had connected, and maybe ended up</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="148" height="19" font="3">in prison himself.</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="105" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;What do you mean, no?&#34; he asked me furiously. &#34;How can you say no? You saw what he did! What are</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="786" height="19" font="3">you telling me? That you're still going to let his <i>connections</i> protect him? After what he did?&#34;</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="574" height="19" font="3">Brutal stared at me, mouth agape, eyes so angry they were watering.</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Listen to me, Brutus - you take a poke at him, and most likely we all go. You, me, Dean, Harry, maybe</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">even Jack Van Hay. Everyone else moves a rung or two up the ladder, starting with Bill Dodge, and the</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Prison Commission hires three or four Breadline Barneys to fill the spots at the bottom. Maybe you can</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">live with that, but-&#34; I cocked my thumb at Dean, who was staring down the dripping, brick-lined tunnel.</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">He was holding his specs in one hand, and looked almost as dazed as Percy. &#34;But what about Dean? He's</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="489" height="19" font="3">got two kids, one in high school and one just about to go.&#34;</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="629" height="19" font="3">&#34;So what's it come down to?&#34; Brutal asked. &#34;We let him get away with it?&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet,&#34; Percy said in a faint, mechanical voice. This was the</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">story he had rehearsed beforehand, of course, when he was expecting a painful prank instead of the</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="610" height="19" font="3">cataclysm we had just witnessed. &#34;It was never wet when we rehearsed.&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">&#34;Aw, you sucker-&#34; Brutal began, and started for Percy. I grabbed him again and yanked him back.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">Footsteps clacked on the steps. I looked up, desperately afraid of seeing Curtis Anderson, but it was</text>

<page number="121" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="810" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger. His cheeks were paper-white and his lips were purplish, as if he'd been eating</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="163" height="19" font="3">blackberry cobbler.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">I switched my attention back to Brutal. &#34;For God's sake, Brutal, Delacroix's dead, nothing can change</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">that, and Percy's not worth it.&#34; Was the plan, or the beginnings of it, in my head even then? I've</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">wondered about that since, let me tell you. I've wondered over the course of a lot of years, and have</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">never been able to come up with a satisfactory answer. I suppose it doesn't matter much. A lot of things</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="673" height="19" font="3">don't matter, but it doesn't keep a man from wondering about them, I've noticed.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;You guys talk about me like I was a chump,&#34; Percy said. He still sounded dazed and winded - as if</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="638" height="19" font="3">someone had punched him deep in the gut - but he was coming back a little.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="281" height="19" font="3">&#34;You are a chump, Percy,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="145" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hey, you can't-&#34;</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I controlled my own urge to hit him only with the greatest effort. Water dripped hollowly from the bricks</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">down in the tunnel; our shadows danced huge and misshapen on the walls, like shadows in that Poe story</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="715" height="19" font="3">about the big ape in the Rue Morgue. Thunder bashed, but down here it was muffled.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;I only want to hear one thing from you, Percy, and that's you repeating your promise to put in for Briar</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="152" height="19" font="3">Ridge tomorrow.&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't worry about that,&#34; he said sullenly. He looked at the sheeted figure on the gurney, looked away,</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">flicked his eyes up toward my face for a moment, then looked away again.</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;That would be for the best,&#34; Harry said. &#34;Otherwise, you might get to know Wild Bill Wharton a whole</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="545" height="19" font="3">lot better than you want to.&#34; A slight pause. &#34;We could see to it.&#34;</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Percy was afraid of us, and he was probably afraid of what we might do if he was still around when we</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">found out he'd been talking to Jack Van Hay about what the sponge was for and why we always soaked it</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">in brine, but Harry's mention of Wharton woke real terror in his eyes. I could see him remembering how</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="511" height="19" font="3">Wharton had held him, ruffling his hair and crooning to him.</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="328" height="19" font="3">&#34;You wouldn't dare,&#34; Percy whispered.</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes I would,&#34; Harry replied calmly. &#34;And do you know what? I'd get away with it. Because you've</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="717" height="19" font="3">already shown yourself to be careless as hell around the prisoners. Incompetent, too.&#34;</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="594" height="19" font="3">Percy's fists bunched and his cheeks colored in a thin pink. &#34;I am not-&#34;</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure you are,&#34; Dean said, joining us. We formed a rough semicircle around Percy at the foot of the</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">stairs, and even a retreat up the tunnel was blocked; the gurney was behind him, with its load of smoking</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">flesh hidden under an old sheet. &#34;You just burned Delacroix alive. If that ain't incompetent, what is?&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Percy's eyes flickered. He had been planning to cover himself by pleading ignorance, and now he saw he</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">was hoist by his own petard. I don't know what he might have said next, because Curtis Anderson came</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="279" height="19" font="3">lunging down the stairs just then.</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="728" height="19" font="3">We heard him and drew back from Percy a little, so as not to look quite so threatening.</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;What in the blue fuck was <i>that</i> all about? Anderson roared. &#34;Jesus Christ, there's puke all over the floor</text>
</page>
<page number="122" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">up there! And the smell! I got Magnusson and Old Toot-Toot to open both doors, but that smell won't</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">come out for five damn years, that's what I'm betting. And that asshole Wharton <i>is singing</i> about it! I can</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="90" height="19" font="3">hear him!&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Can he carry a tune, Curt?&#34; Brutal asked. You know how you can bum off illuminating gas with a single</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">spark and not be hurt if you do it before the concentration gets too heavy? This was like that. We took an</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">instant to gape at Brutus, and then we were all howling. Our high, hysterical laughter flapped up and</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">down the gloomy tunnel like bats. Our shadows bobbed and flickered on the walls. Near the end, even</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="768" height="19" font="3">Percy joined in. At last it died, and in its aftermath we all felt a little better. Felt <i>sane</i> again.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay, boys,&#34; Anderson said, mopping at his teary eyes with his handkerchief and still snorting out an</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="478" height="19" font="3">occasional hiccup of laughter, &#34;what the hell happened?&#34;</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;An execution,&#34; Brutal said. I think his even tone surprised Anderson, but it didn't surprise me, at least</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="809" height="19" font="3">not much; Brutal had always been good at turning down his dials in a hurry. &#34;A successful one.&#34;</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;How in the name of Christ can you call a directcurrent abortion like that a success? We've got witnesses</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="718" height="19" font="3">that won't sleep for a month! Hell, that fat old broad probably won't sleep for a year!&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Brutal pointed at the gurney, and the shape under the sheet. &#34;He's dead, ain't he? As for your witnesses,</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">most of them will be telling their friends tomorrow night that it was poetic justice - Del there burned a</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">bunch of people alive, so we turned around and burned <i>him</i> alive. Except they won't say it was us. They'll</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">say it was the will of God, working <i>through us.</i> Maybe there's even some truth to that. And you want to</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">know the best part? The absolute cat's pajamas? Most of their friends will wish they'd been here to see</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="619" height="19" font="3">it.&#34; He gave Percy a look both distasteful and sardonic as he said this last.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;And if their feathers are a little ruffled, so what?&#34; Harry asked. &#34;They volunteered for the damn job,</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="189" height="19" font="3">nobody drafted them.&#34;</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">&#34;I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet,&#34; Percy said in his robot's voice. &#34;It's never wet in</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="90" height="19" font="3">rehearsal.&#34;</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Dean looked at him with utter disgust. &#34;How many years did you spend pissing on the toilet seat before</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="497" height="19" font="3">someone told you to put it up before you start?&#34; he snarled.</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Percy opened his mouth to reply, but I told him to shut up. For a wonder, he did. I turned to Anderson.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy fucked up, Curtis - that's what happened, pure and simple.&#34; I turned toward Percy, daring him to</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">contradict me. He didn't, maybe because he read my eyes: better that Anderson hear <i>stupid mistake</i> than</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="4"><i>on purpose. </i>And besides, whatever was said down here in the tunnel didn't matter. What mattered, what</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">always matters to the Percy Wetmores of the world, is what gets written down or overheard by the big</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">bugs - the people who matter. What matters to the Percys of the world is how it plays in the newspapers.</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Anderson looked at the five of us uncertainly. He even looked at Del, but Del wasn't talking. &#34;I guess it</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="272" height="19" font="3">could be worse,&#34; Anderson said.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="408" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right,&#34; I agreed. &#34;He could still be alive.&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Curtis blinked - that possibility seemed not to have crossed his mind. &#34;I want a complete report about this</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">on my desk tomorrow,&#34; he said. &#34;And none of you are going to talk to Warden Moores about it until I've</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="223" height="19" font="3">had my chance. Are you?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">We shook our heads vehemently. If Curtis Anderson wanted to tell the warden, why, that was fine by us.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="490" height="19" font="3">&#34;If none of those asshole scribblers put it in their papers -&#34;</text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;They won't,&#34; I said. &#34;If they tried, their editors'd kill it. Too gruesome for a family audience. But they</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">won't even try - they were all vets tonight. Sometimes things go wrong, that's all. They know it as well as</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="65" height="19" font="3">we do.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Anderson considered a moment longer, then nodded. He turned his attention to Percy, an expression of</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">disgust on his usually pleasant face. &#34;You're a little asshole,&#34; he said, &#34;and I don't like you a bit.&#34; He</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">nodded at Percy's look of flabbergasted surprise. &#34;If you tell any of your candy-ass friends I said that, I'll</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">deny it until Aunt Rhody's old gray goose comes back to life, and these men will back me up. You've got</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="138" height="19" font="3">a problem, son.&#34;</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="692" height="19" font="3">He turned and started up the stairs. I let him get four steps and then said: &#34;Curtis?&#34;</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">He turned back, eyebrows raised, saying nothing.</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;You don't want to worry too much about Percy,&#34; I said. &#34;He's moving on to Briar Ridge soon. Bigger</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="3">and better things. Isn't that right, Percy?&#34;</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="460" height="19" font="3">&#34;As soon as his transfer comes through,&#34; Brutal added.</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="600" height="19" font="3">&#34;And until it comes, he's going to call in sick every night,&#34; Dean put in.</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">That roused Percy, who hadn't been working at the prison long enough to have accumulated any paid</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="642" height="19" font="3">sick-time. He looked at Dean with bright distaste. &#34;Don't you wish,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>6.</b></text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">We were back on the block by one-fifteen or so (except for Percy, who had been ordered to clean up the</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">storage room and was sulking his way through the job), me with a report to write. I decided to do it at the</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">duty desk; if I sat in my more comfortable office chair, I'd likely doze off. That probably sounds peculiar</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">to you, given what had happened only an hour before' but I felt as if I'd lived three lifetimes since eleven</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="441" height="19" font="3">o'clock the previous night, all of them without sleep.</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">John Coffey was standing at his cell door, tears streaming from his strange, distant eyes - it was like</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">watching blood run out of some unhealable but strangely painless wound. Closer to the desk, Wharton</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">was sitting on his bunk, rocking from side to side, and singing a song apparently of his own invention,</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="666" height="19" font="3">and not quite nonsense. As well as I can remember, it went something like this:</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="221" height="19" font="3">&#34;Bar-be-cue! Me and you!</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="281" height="19" font="3">Stinky, pinky, phew-phew-phew!</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">It wasn't Billy or Philadelphia Philly, it wasn't Jackie or Roy! It was a warm little number, a hot</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="322" height="19" font="3">cucumber, by the name of Delacroix!&#34;</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="224" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up, you jerk,&#34; I said.</text>
</page>
<page number="124" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">Wharton grinned, showing his mouthful of dingy teeth. <i>He</i> wasn't dying, at least not yet; he was up,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">happy, practically tap-dancing. &#34;Come on in here and make me, why don't you?&#34; he said happily, and</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">then began another verse of &#34;The Barbecue Song,&#34; making up words not quite at random. There was</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">something going on in there, all right. A kind of green and stinking intelligence that was, in its own way,</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="133" height="19" font="3">almost brilliant.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I went down to John Coffey. He wiped away his tears with the heels of his hands. His eyes were red and</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">sore-looking, and it came to me that he was exhausted, too. Why he should have been, a man who</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">trudged around the exercise yard maybe two hours a day and either sat or laid down in his cell the rest of</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="644" height="19" font="3">the time, I didn't know, but I didn't doubt what I was seeing. It was too clear.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="491" height="19" font="3">&#34;Poor Del,&#34; he said in a low, hoarse voice. &#34;Poor old Del.&#34;</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="420" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said. &#34;Poor old Del. John, are you okay?&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="503" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's out of it,&#34; Coffey said. &#34;Del's out of it. Isn't he, boss?&#34;</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="418" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. Answer my question, John. Are you okay?&#34;</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="697" height="19" font="3">&#34;Del's out of it, he's the lucky one. No matter how it happened, he's the lucky one.&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">I thought Delacroix might have given him an argument on that, but didn't say so. I glanced around</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="380" height="19" font="3">Coffey's cell, instead. &#34;Where's Mr. Jingles?&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="747" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ran down there.&#34; He pointed through the bars, down the hall to the restraint-room door.</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="264" height="19" font="3">I nodded. &#34;Well, he'll be back.&#34;</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">But he wasn't; Mr. Jingles's days on the Green Mile were over. The only trace of him we ever happened</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="790" height="19" font="3">on was what Brutal found that winter: a few brightly colored splinters of wood, and a smell of</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="423" height="19" font="3">peppermint candy wafting out of a hole in a beam.</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">I meant to walk away then, but I didn't. I looked at John Coffey, and he back at me as if he knew</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">everything I was thinking. I told myself to get moving, to just call it a night and get moving, back to the</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="544" height="19" font="3">duty desk and my report. Instead I said his name: &#34;John Coffey.&#34;</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="238" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, boss,&#34; he said at once.</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Sometimes a man is cursed with needing to know a thing, and that was how it was with me right then. I</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">dropped down on one knee and began taking off one of my shoes.</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>7.</b></text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">The rain had quit by the time I got home, and a late grin of moon had appeared over the ridges to the</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">north. My sleepiness seemed to have gone with the clouds. I was wide awake, and I could smell</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">Delacroix on me. I thought I might smell him on my skin - barbecue, me and you, stinky, pinky,</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="370" height="19" font="3">phew-phew-phew - for a long time to come.</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">Janice was waiting up, as she always did on execution nights. I meant not to tell her the story, saw no</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">sense in harrowing her with it, but she got a clear look at my face as I came in the kitchen door and</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">would have it all. So I sat down, took her warm hands in my cold ones (the heater in my old Ford barely</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">worked, and the weather had turned a hundred and eighty degrees since the storm), and told her what she</text>

<page number="125" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">thought she wanted to hear. About halfway through I broke down crying, which I hadn't expected. I was</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">a little ashamed, but only a little; it was her, you see, and she never taxed me with the times that I slipped</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">from the way I thought a man should be ... the way I thought I should be, at any rate. A man with a good</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">wife is the luckiest of God's creatures, and one without must be among the most miserable, I think, the</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">only true blessing of their lives that they don't know how poorly off they are. I cried, and she held my</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">head against her breast, and when my own storm passed, I felt better ... a little, anyway. And I believe</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">that was when I had the first conscious sight of my idea. Not the shoe; I don't mean that. The shoe was</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">related, but different. All my real idea was right then, however, was an odd realization: that John Coffey</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">and Melinda Moores, different as they might have been in size and sex and skin color, had exactly the</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="407" height="19" font="3">same eyes: woeful, sad, and distant. Dying eyes.</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="560" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come to bed,&#34; my wife said at last. &#34;Come to bed with me, Paul.&#34;</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">So I did, and we made love, and when it was over she went to sleep. As I lay there watching the moon</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">grin and listening to the walls tick - they were at last pulling in, exchanging summer for fall - I thought</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">about John Coffey saying he had helped it. I <i>helped Del's mouse. I helped Mr. Jingles. He's a circus</i></text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="4"><i>mouse.</i> Sure. And maybe, I thought, we were all circus mice, running around with only the dimmest</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">awareness that God and all His heavenly host were watching us in our Bakelite houses through our</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="162" height="19" font="3">ivy-glass windows.</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I slept a little as the day began to lighten - two hours, I guess, maybe three; and I slept the way I always</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">sleep these days here in Georgia Pines and hardly ever did then, in thin little licks. What I went to sleep</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">thinking about was the churches youth. The names changed, depending on the whims of my mother and</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">her sisters, but they were all really the same, all The First Backwoods Church of Praise Jesus, The Lord</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Is Mighty. In the shadow of those blunt, square steeples, the concept of atonement came up as regularly</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">as the toll of the bell which called the faithful to worship. Only God could forgive sins, could and did,</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">washing them away in the agonal blood of His crucified Son, but that did not change the responsibility of</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">His children to atone for those sins (and even their simple errors of judgement) whenever possible.</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="682" height="19" font="3">Atonement was powerful; it was the lock on the door you closed against the past.</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">I fell asleep thinking of piney-woods atonement, and Eduard Delacroix on fire as he rode the lightning,</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">and Melinda Moores, and my big boy with the endlessly weeping eyes. These thoughts twisted their way</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">into a dream. In it, John Coffey was sitting on a riverbank and bawling his inarticulate mooncalf's grief</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">up at the early-summer sky while on the other bank a freight-train stormed endlessly toward a rusty</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">trestle spanning the Trapingus. In the crook of each arm the black man held the body of a naked,</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">blonde-haired girlchild. His fists, huge brown rocks at the ends of those arms' were closed. All around</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">him crickets chirred and noseeums flocked; the day hummed with heat. In my dream I went to him, knelt</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">before him, and took his hands. His fists relaxed and gave up their secrets. In one was a spool colored</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="544" height="19" font="3">green and red and yellow. In the other was a prison guard's shoe.</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="674" height="19" font="3">&#34;I couldn't help it,&#34; John Coffey said. &#34;I tried to take it back, but it was too late.&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="390" height="19" font="3">And this time, in my dream, I understood him.</text>

<text top="1067" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">At nine o'clock the next morning, while I was having a third cup of coffee in the kitchen (my wife said</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">nothing, but I could see disapproval large on her face when she brought it to me), the telephone rang. I</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">went into the parlor to take it, and Central told someone that their party was holding the line. She then</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">told me to have a birdlarky day and rang off ... presumably. With Central, you could never quite tell for</text>

<text top="98" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">Hal Moores's voice shocked me. Wavery and hoarse, it sounded like the voice of an octogenarian. It</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">occurred to me that it was good that things had gone all right with Curtis Anderson in the tunnel last</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">night, good that he felt about the same as we did about Percy, because this man I was talking to would</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="453" height="19" font="3">very likely never work another day at Cold Mountain.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul, I understand there was trouble last night. I also understand that our friend Mr. Wetmore war,</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="87" height="19" font="3">involved.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;A spot of trouble,&#34; I admitted, holding the receiver tight to my ear and leaning in toward the horn, &#34;but</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="377" height="19" font="3">the job got done. That's the important thing.&#34;</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="148" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. Of course.&#34;</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="569" height="19" font="3">&#34;Can I ask who told you?&#34; So I can tie a can to his tail? I didn't add.</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;You can ask, but since it's really none of your beeswax, I think I'll keep my mouth shut on that score.</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">But when I called my office to see if there were any messages or urgent business, I was told an</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="151" height="19" font="3">interesting thing.&#34;</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="52" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh?&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. Seems a transferral application landed in my basket. Percy Wetmore wants to go to Briar Ridge as</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">soon as possible. Must have filled out the application even before last night's shift was over, wouldn't you</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">think?&#34;</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="254" height="19" font="3">&#34;It sounds that way,&#34; I agreed.</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ordinarily I'd let Curtis handle it, but considering the ... atmosphere on E Block just lately, I asked</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Hannah to run it over to me personally on her lunch hour. She has graciously agreed to do so. I'll approve</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">it and see it's forwarded on to the state capital this afternoon. I expect you'll get a look at Percy's backside</text>

<text top="776" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">He expected me to be pleased with this news, and had a right to expect it. He had taken time out from</text>

<text top="824" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Percy's vaunted connections. Nevertheless, my heart sank. A month! But maybe it didn't matter much,</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">one way or the other. It removed a perfectly natural desire to wait and put off a risky endeavor, and what</text>

<text top="983" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul? Are you there?&#34; His voice lowered a little, as if he thought he was now talking to himself. &#34;Damn,</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="245" height="19" font="3">I think I lost the connection.&#34;</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="324" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, I'm here, Hal. That's great news.&#34;</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; he agreed, and I was again struck by how old he sounded. How papery, somehow. &#34;Oh, I know</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="187" height="19" font="3">what you're thinking.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="127" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="791" height="19" font="3">No, you don't, Warden, I thought. Never in a million years could you know what I'm thinking.</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're thinking that our young friend will still be around for the Coffey execution. That's probably true</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">- Coffey will go well before Thanksgiving, I imagine - but you can put him back in the switch room. No</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="395" height="19" font="3">one will object. Including him, I should think.&#34;</text>
<text top="173" left="15" width="360" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll do that,&#34; I said. &#34;Hal, how's Melinda?&#34;</text>
<text top="212" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">There was a long pause so long I might have thought I'd lost him, except for the sound of his breathing.</text>
<text top="236" left="15" width="737" height="19" font="3">When he spoke this time, it was in a much lower tone of voice. &#34;She's sinking,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="275" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Sinking. That chilly word the old-timers used not to describe a person who was dying, exactly, but one</text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="338" height="19" font="3">who had begun to uncouple from living.</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;The headaches seem a little better ... for now, anyway ... but she can't walk without help, she can't pick</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">things up, she loses control of her water while she sleeps . . .&#34; There was another pause, and then, in an</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="578" height="19" font="3">even lower voice, Hal said something that sounded like &#34;She wears.&#34;</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;Wears what, Hal?&#34; I asked, frowning. My wife had come into the parlor doorway. She stood there</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="434" height="19" font="3">wiping her hands on a dishtowel and looking at me.</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="717" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; he said in a voice that seemed to waver between anger and tears. &#34;She swears.&#34;</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh.&#34; I still didn't know what he meant, but had no intention of pursuing it. I didn't have to; he did it for</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="31" height="19" font="3">me.</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;She'll be all right, perfectly normal, talking about her flower-garden or a dress she saw in the catalogue,</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">or maybe about how she heard Roosevelt on the radio and how wonderful he sounds, and then, all at</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">once, she'll start to say the most awful things, the most awful ... words. She doesn't raise her voice. It</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="636" height="19" font="3">would almost be better if she did, I think, because then ... you see, <i>then . . .&#34;</i></text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="362" height="19" font="3">&#34;She wouldn't sound so much like herself.&#34;</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's it,&#34; he said gratefully. &#34;But to hear her saying those awful gutter-language things in her sweet</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">voice ... pardon me, Paul.&#34; His voice trailed away and I heard him noisily clearing his throat. Then he</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">came back, sounding a little stronger but just as distressed. &#34;She wants to have Pastor Donaldson over,</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="806" height="19" font="3">and I know he's a comfort to her, but how can I ask him? Suppose that he's sitting there, reading</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Scripture with her, and she calls him a foul name? She could; she called me one last night. She said,</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">'Hand me that <i>Liberty</i> magazine, you cocksucker, would you?' Paul, where could she have ever heard</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="436" height="19" font="3">such language? How could she know those words?&#34;</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="504" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know. Hal, are you going to be home this evening?&#34;</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">When he was well and in charge of himself, not distracted by worry or grief, Hal Moores had a cutting</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">and sarcastic facet to his personality; his subordinates feared that side of him even more than his anger or</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">his contempt, I think. His sarcasm, usually impatient and often harsh, could sting like acid. A little of that</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">now splashed on me. It was unexpected, but on the whole I was glad to hear it. All the fight hadn't gone</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="253" height="19" font="3">out of him after all, it seemed.</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; he said, &#34;I'm taking Melinda out squaredancing. We're going to do-si-do, allemand left, and then</text>

<text top="137" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm sorry,&#34; he said. &#34;I haven't been getting much sleep lately. It's made me grouchy. Of course we're</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="312" height="19" font="3">going to be home. Why do you ask?&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="284" height="19" font="3">&#34;It doesn't matter, I guess,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="3">&#34;You weren't thinking of coming by, were you?</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">Because if you were on last night, you'll be on tonight. Unless you've switched with somebody?&#34;</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="413" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, I haven't switched,&#34; I said. &#34;I'm on tonight.&#34;</text>
<text top="356" left="15" width="568" height="19" font="3">&#34;It wouldn't be a good idea, anyway. Not the way she is right now.&#34;</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="307" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe not. Thanks for your news.&#34;</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="394" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're welcome. Pray for my Melinda, Paul.&#34;</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I said I would, thinking that I might do quite a bit more than pray. God helps those who help themselves,</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">as they say in The Church of Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty. I hung up and looked at Janice.</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="226" height="19" font="3">&#34;How's Melly?&#34; she asked.</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not good.&#34; I told her what Hal had told me, including the part about the swearing, although I left out</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">cocksucker and rooster-dick motherfucker. I finished with Hal's word, <i>sinking,</i> and Jan nodded sadly.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="288" height="19" font="3">Then she took a closer look at me.</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">&#34;What are you thinking about? You're thinking about <i>something,</i> probably no good. It's in your face.&#34;</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Lying was out of the question; it wasn't the way we were with each other. I just told her it was best she</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="309" height="19" font="3">not know, at least for the time being.</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is it ... could it get you in trouble?&#34; She didn't sound particularly alarmed at the idea - more interested</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="611" height="19" font="3">than anything - which is one of the things I have always loved about her.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="137" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="169" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is it a good thing?&#34;</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe,&#34; I repeated. I was standing there, still turning the phone's crank idly with one finger, while I</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="540" height="19" font="3">held down the connecting points with a finger of my other hand.</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;Would you like me to leave you alone while you use the telephone?&#34; she asked. &#34;Be a good little woman</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="433" height="19" font="3">and butt out? Do some dishes? Knit some booties?&#34;</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="375" height="19" font="3">I nodded. &#34;That's not the way I'd put it, but-&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="335" height="19" font="3">&#34;Are we having extras for lunch, Paul?&#34;</text>

<text top="47" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>9.</b></text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">I got Brutal and Dean right away, because both of them were on the exchange. Harry wasn't, not then, at</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">least, but I had the number of his closest neighbor who was. Harry called me back about twenty minutes</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">later, highly embarrassed at having to reverse the charges and sputtering promises to &#34;pay his share&#34;</text>
<text top="158" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">when our next bill came. I told him we'd count those chickens when they hatched; in the meantime, could</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">he come over to my place for lunch? Brutal and Dean would be here, and Janice had promised to put out</text>
<text top="206" left="15" width="638" height="19" font="3">some of her famous slaw ... not to mention her even more famous apple pie.</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="467" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lunch just for the hell of it?&#34; Harry sounded skeptical.</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">I admitted I had something I wanted to talk to them about, but it was best not gone into, even lightly,</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">over the phone. Harry agreed to come. I dropped the receiver onto the prongs, went to the window, and</text>
<text top="332" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">looked out thoughtfully. Although we'd had the late shift, I hadn't wakened either Brutal or Dean, and</text>
<text top="356" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Harry hadn't sounded like a fellow freshly turned out of dreamland, either. It seemed that I wasn't the</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">only one having problems with what had happened last night, and considering the craziness I had in</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="255" height="19" font="3">mind, that was probably good.</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Brutal, who lived closest to me, arrived at quarter past eleven. Dean showed up fifteen minutes later, and</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="794" height="19" font="3">Harry - already dressed for work - about fifteen minutes after Dean. Janice served us cold beef</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">sandwiches, slaw, and iced tea in the kitchen. Only a day before, we would have had it out on the side</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">porch and been glad of a breeze, but the temperature had dropped a good fifteen degrees since the</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="626" height="19" font="3">thunderstorm, and a keen-edged wind was snuffling down from the ridges.</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="455" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're welcome to sit down with us,&#34; I told my wife.</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">She shook her head. &#34;I don't think I want to know what you're up to - I'll worry less if I'm in the dark. I'll</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">have a bite in the parlor. I'm visiting with Miss Jane Austen this week, and she's very good company.&#34;</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who's Jane Austen?&#34; Harry asked when she had left. &#34;Your side or Janices's, Paul? A cousin? Is she</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="67" height="19" font="3">pretty?&#34;</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;She's a writer, you nit,&#34; Brutal told him. &#34;Been dead practically since Betsy Ross basted the stars on the</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="86" height="19" font="3">first flag.&#34;</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="718" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh.&#34; Harry looked embarrassed. &#34;I'm not much of a reader. Radio manuals, mostly.&#34;</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="358" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's on your mind, Paul?&#34; Dean asked.</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey and Mr. Jingles, to start with.&#34; They looked surprised, which I had expected - they'd been</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">thinking I wanted to discuss either Delacroix or Percy. Maybe both. I looked at Dean and Harry &#34;The</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">thing with Mr. Jingles - what Coffey did - happened pretty fast. I don't know if you got there in time to</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="356" height="19" font="3">see how broken up the mouse was or not.&#34;</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="508" height="19" font="3">Dean shook his head. &#34;I saw the blood on the floor, though.&#34;</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="150" height="19" font="3">I turned to Brutal.</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;That son of a bitch Percy crushed it,&#34; he said simply. &#34;It should have died, but it didn't. Coffey did</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="787" height="19" font="3">something to it. Healed it somehow. I know how that sounds, but I saw it with my own eyes.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="130" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">I said: &#34;He healed me, as well, and I didn't just see it, I <i>felt</i> it.&#34; I told them about my urinary infection -</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">how it had come back, how bad it had been (I pointed through the window at the woodpile I'd had to hold</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">onto the morning the pain drove me to my knees), and how it had gone away completely after Coffey</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="258" height="19" font="3">touched me. And stayed away.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">It didn't take long to tell. When I was done, they sat and thought about it awhile, chewing on their</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="761" height="19" font="3">sandwiches as they did. Then Dean said, &#34;Black things came out of his mouth. Like bugs.&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right,&#34; Harry agreed. &#34;They were black to start with, anyway. Then they turned white and</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">disappeared.&#34; He looked around, considering. &#34;It's like I damned near forgot the whole thing until you</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="317" height="19" font="3">brought it up, Paul. Ain't that funny?&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing funny or strange about it,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I think that's what people most always do with the stuff</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">they can't make out - just forget it. Doesn't do a person much good to remember stuff that doesn't make</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="585" height="19" font="3">any sense. What about it, Paul? Were there bugs when he fixed you?&#34;</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. I think they're the sickness ... the pain ... the hurt. He takes it in, then lets it out into the open air</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="59" height="19" font="3">again.&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="233" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where it dies,&#34; Harry said.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="591" height="19" font="3">I shrugged. I didn't know if it died or not, wasn't sure it even mattered.</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Did he suck it out of you?&#34; Brutal asked. &#34;He looked like he was sucking it right out of the mouse. The</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="294" height="19" font="3">hurt. The ... you know. The death.&#34;</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; I said. &#34;He just touched me. And I felt it. A kind of jolt, like electricity only not painful. But I</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="233" height="19" font="3">wasn't dying, only hurting.&#34;</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Brutal nodded. &#34;The touch and the breath. Just like you hear those backwoods gospel-shouters going on</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">about.&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="346" height="19" font="3">&#34;Praise Jesus, the Lord is mighty,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;I dunno if Jesus comes into it,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;but it seems to me like John Coffey is one mighty man.&#34;</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; Dean said. &#34;If you say all this happened, I guess I believe it. God works in mysterious ways</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">His wonders to perform. But what's it got to do with us?&#34;</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">Well, that was the big question, wasn't it? I took in a deep breath and told them what I wanted to do.</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">They listened, dumbfounded. Even Brutal, who liked to read those magazines with the stories about little</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">green men from space, looked dumbfounded. There was a longer silence when I finished this time, and</text>

<text top="965" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">At last, in a gentle and reasonable voice, Brutus Howell said: &#34;We'd lose our jobs if we were caught,</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">&#34;She's the sweetest woman you could ever hope to meet,&#34; I said, &#34;and she means the world to him.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="677" height="19" font="3">&#34;But we don't know her the way you and Janice do,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Do we, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;You'd like her if you did,&#34; I said. &#34;At least, you'd like her if you'd met her before this thing got its claws</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">into her. She does a lot of community things, she's a good friend, and she's religious. More than that,</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">she's funny. Used to be, anyway. She could tell you things that'd make you laugh until the tears rolled</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">down your cheeks. But none of those things are the reason I want to help save her, if she can be saved.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">What's happening to her is an <i>offense, </i>goddammit, an <i>offense. To</i> the eyes and the ears and the heart.&#34;</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Very noble, but I doubt like hell if that's what put this bee in your bonnet,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I think it's what</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">happened to Del. You want to balance it off somehow.&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">And he was right. Of course he was. I knew Melinda Moores better than the others did, but maybe not, in</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">the end, well enough to ask them to risk their jobs for her - and possibly their freedom, as well. Or my</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">own job and freedom, for that matter. I had two children, and the last thing on God's earth that I wanted</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">my wife to have to do was to write them the news that their father was going on trial for... well, what</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">would it be? I didn't know for sure. Aiding and abetting an escape attempt seemed the most likely.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">But the death of Eduard Delacroix had been the ugliest, foulest thing I had ever seen in my life - not just</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">my working life but my whole, entire life - and I had been a party to it. We had all been a party to it,</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">because we had allowed Percy Wetmore to stay even after we knew he was horribly unfit to work in a</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">place like E Block. We had played the game. Even Warden Moores had been a party to it. &#34;His nuts are</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">going to cook whether Wetmore's on the team or not,&#34; he had said, and maybe that was well enough,</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">considering what the little Frenchman had done, but in the end Percy had done a lot more than cook Del's</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">nuts; he had blown the little man's eyeballs right out of their sockets and set his damned face on fire. And</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">why? Because Del was a murderer half a dozen times over? No. Because Percy had wet his pants and the</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">little Cajun had had the temerity to laugh at him. We'd been part of a monstrous act, and Percy was going</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">to get away with it. Off to Briar Ridge he would go, happy as a clam at high tide, and there he would</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">have a whole asylum filled with lunatics to practice his cruelties upon. There was nothing we could do</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="735" height="19" font="3">about that, but perhaps it was not too late to wash some of the muck off our own hands.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;In my church they call it atonement instead of balancing,&#34; I said, &#34;but I guess it comes to the same</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="57" height="19" font="3">thing.&#34;</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do you really think Coffey <i>could</i> save her?&#34; Dean asked in a soft, awed voice. '&#34;Just ... what? ... suck</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="526" height="19" font="3">that brain tumor out of her head? Like it was a ... a peach-pit?&#34;</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think he could. It's not for sure, of course, but after what he did to me ... and to Mr. Jingles . . .&#34;</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="505" height="19" font="3">&#34;That mouse was seriously busted up, all right,&#34; Brutal said.</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="414" height="19" font="3">&#34;But would he do it?&#34; Harry mused. <i>&#34;Would</i> he?&#34;</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="221" height="19" font="3">&#34;If he can, he will,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="331" height="19" font="3">&#34;Why? Coffey doesn't even know her!&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="477" height="19" font="3">&#34;Because it's what he does. It's what God made him for.&#34;</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Brutal made a show of looking around, reminding us all that someone was missing. &#34;What about Percy?</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">You think he's just gonna let this go down?&#34; he asked, and so I told them what I had in mind for Percy</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">By the time I finished, Harry and Dean were looking at me in amazement, and a reluctant grin of</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="339" height="19" font="3">admiration had dawned on Brutal's face.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="601" height="19" font="3">&#34;Pretty audacious, Brother Paul!&#34; he said. &#34;Fair takes my breath away!&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;But wouldn't it be the bee's knees!&#34; Dean almost whispered, then laughed aloud and clapped his hands</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">like a child. &#34;I mean, voh-doh-dee-oh-doh and twenty-three-skidoo!&#34; You want to remember that Dean</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">had a special interest in the part of my plan that involved Percy - Percy - Percy could have gotten Dean</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="366" height="19" font="3">killed, after all, freezing up the way he had.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, but what about after?&#34; Harry said. He sounded gloomy, but his eyes gave him away; they were</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="593" height="19" font="3">sparkling, the eyes of a man who wants to be convinced. &#34;What then?&#34;</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;They say dead men tell no tales,&#34; Brutal rumbled, and I took a quick look at him to make sure he was</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="59" height="19" font="3">joking.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="349" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think he'll keep his mouth shut,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Really?&#34; Dean looked skeptical. He took off his glasses and began to polish them. &#34;Convince me.&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;First, he won't know what really happened - he's going to judge us by himself and think it was just a</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">prank. Second - and more <i>important - he'll be afraid to say anything.</i> That's what I'm really counting on.</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">We tell him that if he starts writing letters and making phone calls, <i>we</i> start writing letters and making</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="109" height="19" font="3">phone calls.&#34;</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="291" height="19" font="3">&#34;About the execution,&#34; Harry said.</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;And about the way he froze when Wharton attacked Dean,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I think people finding out</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">about that is what Percy Wetmore's really afraid of.&#34; He nodded slowly and thoughtfully. &#34;It could work.</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">But Paul... wouldn't it make more sense to bring Mrs. Moores to Coffey than Coffey to Mrs. Moores? We</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">could take care of Percy pretty much the way you laid it out, then bring her in through the tunnel instead</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="262" height="19" font="3">of taking Coffey out that way.&#34;</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="483" height="19" font="3">I shook my head. &#34;Never happen. Not in a million years.&#34;</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="260" height="19" font="3">&#34;Because of Warden Moores?&#34;</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mat's right. He's so hardheaded he makes old Doubting Thomas look like Joan of Arc. If we bring</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Coffey to his house, I think we can surprise him into at least letting Coffey make the try. Otherwise...&#34;</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="559" height="19" font="3">&#34;What were you thinking about using for a vehicle?&#34; Brutal asked.</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">&#34;My first thought was the stagecoach,&#34; I said, &#34;but we'd never get it out of the yard without being</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">noticed, and everyone within a twenty-mile radius knows what it looks like, anyway. I guess maybe we</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="153" height="19" font="3">can use my Ford.&#34;</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;Guess again,&#34; Dean said, popping his specs back onto his nose. &#34;You couldn't get John Coffey into your</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">car if you stripped him naked, covered him with lard, and used a shoehorn. You're so used to looking at</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="3">him that you've forgotten how big he is.&#34;</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">I had no reply to that. Most of my attention that morning had been focused on the problem of Percy - and</text>

<page number="133" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">the lesser but not inconsiderable problem of Wild Bill Wharton. Now I realized that transportation wasn't</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="311" height="19" font="3">going to be as simple as I had hoped.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger picked up the remains of his second sandwich, looked at it for a second, then put it</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">down again. &#34;If we was to actually do this crazy thing,&#34; he said, &#34;I guess we could use my pickup truck.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">Sit him in the back of that. Wouldn't be nobody much on the roads at that hour. We're talking about well</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="213" height="19" font="3">after midnight, ain't we?&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="112" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;You guys're forgetting one thing,&#34; Dean said. &#34;I know Coffey's been pretty quiet ever since he came on</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">the block, doesn't do much but lay there on his bunk and leak from the eyes, but he's a <i>murderer.</i> Also,</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">he's <i>huge. </i>If he decided he wanted to escape out of the back of Harry's truck, the only way we could stop</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">him would be to shoot him dead. And a guy like that would take a lot of killing, even with a .45. Suppose</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">we weren't able to put him down? And suppose he killed someone else? I'd hate losing my job, and I'd</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">hate going to jail - I got a wife and kids depending on me to put bread in their mouths - but I don't think</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="806" height="19" font="3">I'd hate either of those things near as much as having another dead little girl on my conscience.&#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="234" height="19" font="3">&#34;That won't happen,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="413" height="19" font="3">&#34;How in God's name can you be so sure of that?&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I didn't answer. I didn't know just how to begin. I had known this would come up, of course I did, but I</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="616" height="19" font="3">still didn't know how to start telling them what I knew. Brutal helped me.</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;You don't think he did it, do you, Paul?&#34; He looked incredulous. &#34;You think that big lug is innocent.&#34;</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="292" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm positive he's innocent,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="339" height="19" font="3">&#34;How in the name of Jesus can you be?&#34;</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;There are two things,&#34; I said. &#34;One of them is my shoe.&#34; I leaned forward over the table and began</text>

<text top="59" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">crank until your arm practically fell off.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I've had a lot of easy starts since I started telling the story of John Coffey, but yesterday I had to crank. I</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">think it was because I'd gotten to Delacroix's execution, and part of my mind didn't want to have to relive</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">that. It was a bad death, a <i>terrible</i> death, and it happened the way it did because of Percy Wetmore, a</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">young man who loved to comb his hair but couldn't stand to be laughed at - not even by a half bald little</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="496" height="19" font="3">Frenchman who was never going to see another Christmas.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">As with most dirty jobs, however, the hardest part is just getting started. It doesn't matter to an engine</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">whether you use the key or have to crank; once you get it going, it'll usually run just as sweet either way.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">That's how it worked for me yesterday. At first the words came in little bursts of phrasing, then in whole</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">sentences, then in a torrent. Writing is a special and rather terrifying form of remembrance, I've</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">discovered - there is a totality to it that seems almost like rape. Perhaps I only feel that way because I've</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">become a very old man (a thing that happened behind my own back, I sometimes feel), but I don't think</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">so. I believe that the combination of pencil and memory creates a kind of practical magic, and magic is</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">dangerous. As a man who knew John Coffey and saw what he could do - to mice and to men - l feel very</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="171" height="19" font="3">qualified to say that.</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="170" height="19" font="3">Magic is dangerous.</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">In any case, I wrote all day yesterday, the words simply flooding out of me, the sunroom of this glorified</text>

<text top="575" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">the road. That was where Dean and Harry and Brutal and I confronted Percy Wetmore over Eduard</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's smoking body and made Percy renew his promise to put in for transfer to the Briar Ridge</text>

<text top="662" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">There are always fresh flowers in the sunroom, but by noon yesterday all I could smell was the noxious</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">aroma of the dead man's cooked flesh. The sound of the power mower on the lawn down below had been</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">replaced by the hollow plink of dripping water as it seeped slowly through the tunnel's curved roof. The</text>

<text top="797" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">aching. I walked slowly down to the end of the second-floor corridor. There's a window there that looks</text>

<text top="845" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">altogether too curious about where I go and what I do on my walks - drives an old Chevrolet with a</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">bumper sticker that says I HAVE SEEN GOD AND HIS NAME IS NEWT. It was gone; Brad's shift was</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">over and he'd taken himself off to whatever garden spot he calls home. I envision an Airstream trailer</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="705" height="19" font="3">with <i>Hustler</i> gatefolds Scotch-taped to the walls and Dixie Beer cans in the corners.</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I went out through the kitchen, where dinner preparations were getting started. &#34;What you got in that bag,</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="307" height="19" font="3">Mr. Edgecombe?&#34; Norton asked me.</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's an empty bottle,&#34; I said. &#34;I've discovered the Fountain of Youth down there in the woods. I pop</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">down every afternoon about this time and draw a little. I drink it at bedtime. Good stuff, I can tell you.&#34;</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">&#34;May be keepin you young,&#34; said George, the other cook, &#34;but it ain't doin <i>shit</i> for your looks.-&#34;</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">We all had a laugh at that, and I went out. I found myself looking around for Dolan even though his car</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">was gone, called myself a chump for letting him get so far under my skin, and crossed the croquet course.</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Beyond it is a scraggy little putting green that looks ever so much nicer in the Georgia Pines brochures,</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">and beyond that is a path that winds into the little copse of woods east of the nursing home. There are a</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">couple of old sheds along this path, neither of them used for anything these days. At the second, which</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">stands close to the high stone wall between the Georgia Pines grounds and Georgia Highway 47, I went</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="256" height="19" font="3">in and stayed for a little while.</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">I ate a good dinner that night, watched a little TV, and went to bed early. On many nights I'll wake up</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">and creep back down to the TV room, where I watch old movies on the American Movie Channel. Not</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">last night, though; last night I slept like a stone, and with none of the dreams that have so haunted me</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">since I started my adventures in literature. All that writing must have worn me out; I'm not as young as I</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="184" height="19" font="3">used to be, you know.</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">When I woke and saw that the patch of sun which usually lies on the floor at six in the morning had made</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">it all the way up to the foot of my bed, I hit the deck in a hurry, so alarmed I hardly noticed the arthritic</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">flare of pain in my hips and knees and ankles. I dressed as fast as I could, then hurried down the hall to</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">the window that overlooks the employees' parking lot, hoping the slot where Dolan parks his old</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="653" height="19" font="3">Chevrolet would still be empty. Sometimes he's as much as half an hour late -</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">No such luck. The car was there, gleaming rustily in the morning sun. Because Mr. Brad Dolan has</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">something to arrive on time for these days, doesn't he? Yes. Old Paulie Edgecombe goes somewhere in</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">the early mornings, old Paulie Edgecombe is up to something, and Mr. Brad Dolan intends to find out</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">what it <i>is. What do you do down there, Paulie? Tell me.</i> He would likely be watching for me already. It</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="512" height="19" font="3">would be smart to stay right where I was ... except I couldn't.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">I turned around so fast I almost fell down. It was my friend Elaine Connelly. Her eyes widened and she</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">put out her hands, as if to catch me. Lucky for her I caught my balance; Elaine's arthritis is terrible, and I</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">probably would have broken her in two like a dry stick if I'd fallen into her arms. Romance doesn't die</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">when you pass into the strange country that lies beyond eighty, but you can forget the <i>Cone with the</i></text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="91" height="19" font="4"><i>Wind</i> crap.</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="428" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm sorry,&#34; she said. &#34;I didn't mean to startle you.&#34;</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's all right,&#34; I said, and gave her a feeble smile. &#34;It's a better wake-up than a faceful of cold water. I</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="338" height="19" font="3">should hire you to do it every morning.&#34;</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="481" height="19" font="3">&#34;You were looking for his car, weren't you? Dolan's car.&#34;</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">There was no sense kidding her about it, so I nodded. &#34;I wish I could be sure he's over in the west wing.</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="566" height="19" font="3">I'd like to slip out for a little while, but I don't want him to see me.&#34;</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">She smiled - a ghost of the teasing imp's smile she must have had as a girl. &#34;Nosy bastard, isn't he?&#34;</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="55" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes.&#34;</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's not in the west wing, either. I've already been down to breakfast, sleepyhead, and I can tell you</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="430" height="19" font="3">where he is, because I peeked. He's in the kitchen.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="136" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="41" left="15" width="673" height="19" font="3">I looked at her, dismayed. I had known Dolan was curious, but not how curious.</text>
<text top="80" left="15" width="442" height="19" font="3">&#34;Can you put your morning walk off?&#34; Elaine asked.</text>
<text top="119" left="15" width="375" height="19" font="3">I thought about it. &#34;I could, I suppose, but...&#34;</text>
<text top="158" left="15" width="140" height="19" font="3">&#34;You shouldn't.&#34;</text>
<text top="197" left="15" width="147" height="19" font="3">&#34;No. I shouldn't.&#34;</text>
<text top="236" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">Now, I thought, <i>she'll ask me where I go, what I have to</i> do <i>down in those woods that's so damned</i></text>
<text top="260" left="15" width="88" height="19" font="4"><i>important.</i></text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">But she didn't. Instead she gave me that imp's smile again. It looked strange and absolutely wonderful on</text>
<text top="323" left="15" width="634" height="19" font="3">her too-gaunt, pain-haunted face. &#34;Do you know Mr. Howland?&#34; she asked.</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure,&#34; I said, although I didn't see him much; he was in the west wing, which at Georgia Pines was</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="361" height="19" font="3">almost like a neighboring country. &#34;Why?&#34;</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="352" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do you know what's special about him?&#34;</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="145" height="19" font="3">I shook my head.</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mr. Howland,&#34; Elaine said, smiling more widely than ever, &#34;is one of only five residents left at Georgia</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">Pines who have permission to smoke. That's because he was a resident before the rules changed.&#34;</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="801" height="19" font="3">A grandfather clause, I thought. And what place was more fitted for one than an old-age home?</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">She reached into the pocket of her blue-and-white-striped dress and pulled two items partway out: a</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">cigarette and a book of matches. &#34;Thief of green, thief red,&#34; she sang in a lilting, funny voice. &#34;Little</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="242" height="19" font="3">Ellie's going to wet the bed.&#34;</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="140" height="19" font="3">&#34;Elaine, what - &#34;</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Walk an old girl downstairs,&#34; she said, putting the cigarette and matches back into her pocket and taking</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">my arm in one of her gnarled hands. We began to walk back down the hall. As we did, I decided to give</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="593" height="19" font="3">up and put myself in her hands. She was old and brittle, but not stupid.</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">As we went down, walking with the glassy care of the relics we have now become, Elaine said: &#34;Wait at</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">the foot. I'm going over to the west wing, to the hall toilet there. You know the one I mean, don't you?&#34;</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="459" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said. &#34;The one just outside the spa. But why?&#34;</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;I haven't had a cigarette in over fifteen years,&#34; she said, &#34;but I feel like one this morning. I don't know</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="736" height="19" font="3">how many puffs it'll take to set off the smoke detector in there, but I intend to find out.&#34;</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I looked at her with dawning admiration, thinking how much she reminded me of my wife - Jan might</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">have done exactly the same thing. Elaine looked back at me, smiling her saucy imp's smile. I cupped my</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">hand around the back of her lovely long neck, drew her face to mine, and kissed her mouth lightly. &#34;I</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="193" height="19" font="3">love you, Ellie,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="537" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oooh, such big talk,&#34; she said, but I could tell she was pleased.</text>

<page number="137" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="601" height="19" font="3">&#34;What about Chuck Howland?&#34; I asked. &#34;Is he going to get in trouble?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, because he's in the TV room, watching <i>Good Morning America</i> with about two dozen other folks.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">And I'm going to make myself scarce as soon as the smoke detector turns on the west-wing fire alarm.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="653" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't you fall down and hurt yourself, woman. I'd never forgive myself if - &#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, stop your fussing,&#34; she said, and this time <i>she</i> kissed <i>me. </i>Love among the ruins. It probably sounds</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">funny to some of you and grotesque to the rest of you, but I'll tell you something, my friend: weird love's</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="209" height="19" font="3">better than no love at all.</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I watched her walk away, moving slowly and stiffly (but she will only use a cane on wet days, and only</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">then if the pain is terrible; it's one of her vanities), and waited. Five minutes went by, then ten, and just as</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">I was deciding she had either lost her courage or discovered that the battery of the smoke detector in the</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="691" height="19" font="3">toilet was dead, the fire alarm went off in the west wing with a loud, buzzing burr.</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">I started toward the kitchen at once, but slowly - there was no reason to hurry until I was sure Dolan was</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">out of my way. A gaggle of old folks, most still in their robes, came out of the TV room (here it's called</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">the Resource Center; now <i>that's</i> grotesque) to see what was going on. Chuck Howland was among them,</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">I was happy to see.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Edgecombe!&#34; Kent Avery rasped, hanging onto his walker with one hand and yanking obsessively at the</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">crotch of his pajama pants with the other. &#34;Real alarm or just another falsie? What do you think?&#34;</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="316" height="19" font="3">&#34;No way of knowing, I guess,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">Just about then three orderlies went trotting past, all headed for the west wing, yelling at the folks</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">clustered around the TV-room door to go outside and wait for the all-clear. The third in line was Brad</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Dolan. He didn't even look at me as he went past, a fact that pleased me to no end. As I went on down</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">toward the kitchen, it occurred to me that the team of Elaine Connelly and Paul Edgecombe would</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">probably be a match for a dozen Brad Dolans, with half a dozen Percy Wetmores thrown in for good</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="75" height="19" font="3">measure.</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">The cooks in the kitchen were continuing to clear up breakfast, paying no attention to the howling fire.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="100" height="19" font="3">alarm at all.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Say, Mr. Edgecombe,&#34; George said. &#34;I believe Brad Dolan been lookin for you. In fact, you just missed</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="46" height="19" font="3">him.&#34;</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="4"><i>Lucky me, I</i> thought. What I said out loud was that I'd probably see Mr. Dolan later. Then I asked if there</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="429" height="19" font="3">was any leftover toast lying around from breakfast.</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="761" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure,&#34; Norton said, &#34;but it's stone-cold dead in the market. You runnin late this morning.&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="291" height="19" font="3">&#34;I am,&#34; I agreed, &#34;but I'm hungry.&#34;</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="726" height="19" font="3">&#34;Only take a minute to make some fresh and hot,&#34; George said, reaching for the bread.</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nope, cold will be fine,&#34; I said, and when he handed me a couple of slices (looking mystified - actually</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">both of them looked mystified), I hurried out the door, feeling like the boy I once was, skipping school to</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="762" height="19" font="3">go fishing with a jelly fold-over wrapped in waxed paper slipped into the front of my shirt.</text>

<page number="138" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Outside the kitchen door I took a quick, reflexive look around for Dolan, saw nothing to alarm me, and</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">hurried across the croquet course and putting green, gnawing on one of my pieces of toast as I went. I</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">slowed a little as I entered the shelter of the woods, and as I walked down the path, I found my mind</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">turning to the day after Eduard Delacroix's terrible execution.</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I had spoken to Hal Moores that morning, and he had told me that Melinda's brain tumor had caused her</text>
<text top="173" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">to lapse into bouts of cursing and foul language ... what my wife had later labelled (rather tentatively; she</text>
<text top="197" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">wasn't sure it was really the same thing) as Tourette's Syndrome. The quavering in his voice, coupled</text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">with the memory of how John Coffey had healed both my urinary infection and the broken back of</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's pet mouse, had finally pushed me over the line that runs between just thinking about a thing</text>
<text top="269" left="15" width="223" height="19" font="3">and actually <i>doing</i> a thing.</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">And there was something else. Something that had to do with John Coffey's hands, and my shoe.</text>
<text top="347" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">So I had called the men I worked with, the men I had trusted my life to over the years - Dean Stanton,</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">Harry Terwilliger, Brutus Howell. They came to lunch at my house on the day after Delacroix's</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">execution, and they at least listened to me when I outlined my plan. Of course, they all knew that Coffey</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">had healed the mouse; Brutal had actually seen it. So when I suggested that another miracle might result</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">if we took John Coffey to Melinda Moores, they didn't outright laugh. It was Dean Stanton who raised</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">the most troubling question: What if John Coffey escaped while we had him out on his field-trip?</text>
<text top="506" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;Suppose he killed someone else?&#34; Dean asked. &#34;I'd hate losing my job, and I'd hate going to jail - I got a</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">wife and kids depending on me to put bread in their mouths - but I don't think I'd hate either of those</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="613" height="19" font="3">things near as much as having another little dead girl on my conscience.&#34;</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">There was silence, then, all of them looking at me, waiting to see how I'd respond. I knew everything</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">would change if I said what was on the tip of my tongue; we had reached a point beyond which retreat</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="278" height="19" font="3">would likely become impossible.</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="708" height="19" font="3">Except retreat, for me, at least, was already impossible. I opened my mouth and said</text>

<text top="758" left="15" width="178" height="19" font="3">&#34;That won't happen.&#34;</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="461" height="19" font="3">&#34;How in God's name can you be so sure?&#34; Dean asked.</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">I didn't answer. I didn't know just how to begin. I had known this would come up, of course I had, but I</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="741" height="19" font="3">still didn't know how to start telling them what was in my head and heart. Brutal helped.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;You don't think he did it, do you, Paul?&#34; He looked incredulous. &#34;You think that big lug is innocent.&#34;</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="292" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm positive he's innocent,&#34; I said.</text>

<text top="1016" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">&#34;There are two things,&#34; I said. &#34;One of them is my shoe.&#34;</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your <i>shoe?&#34;</i> Brutal exclaimed. 'What has your <i>shoe</i> got to do with whether or not John Coffey killed</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;I took off one of my shoes and gave it to him last night,&#34; I said. &#34;After the execution, this was, when</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">things had settled back down a little. I pushed it <i>through the</i> bars, and he picked it up in those big hands</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">of his. I told him to tie it. I had to make sure, you see, because all our problem children normally wear is</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">slippers - a man who really wants to commit suicide can do it with shoelaces, if he's dedicated. That's</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="226" height="19" font="3">something all of us know.&#34;</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="169" height="19" font="3">They were nodding.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;He put it on his lap and got the ends of the laces crossed over all right, but then he was stuck. He said he</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">was pretty sure someone had showed him how to do it when he was a lad - maybe his father or maybe</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="762" height="19" font="3">one of the boyfriends his mother had after the father was gone - but he'd forgot the knack.&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm with Brutal - I still don't see what your shoe has to do with whether or not Coffey killed the</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="237" height="19" font="3">Detterick twins,&#34; Dean said.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">So I went over the story of the abduction and murder again - what I'd read that hot day in the prison</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">library with my groin sizzling and Gibbons snoring in the comer, and all that the reporter, Hammersmith,</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="111" height="19" font="3">told me later.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;The Dettericks' dog wasn't much of a biter, but it was a world-class barker,&#34; I said. &#34;The man who took</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">the girls kept it quiet by feeding it sausages. He crept a little closer every time he gave it one, I imagine,</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">and while the mutt was eating the last one, he reached out, grabbed it by the head, and twisted. Broke its</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="45" height="19" font="3">neck.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Later, when they caught up with Coffey, the deputy in charge of the posse - Rob McGee, his name</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">was-spotted a bulge in the chest pocket of the biballs Coffey was wearing. McGee <i>thought at</i> first it</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">might be a gun. Coffey said it was a lunch, and that's what it turned out to be - a couple of sandwiches</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">and a pickle, wrapped up in newspaper and tied with butcher's string. Coffey couldn't remember who</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="509" height="19" font="3">gave it to him, only that it was a woman wearing an apron.-&#34;</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="469" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sandwiches and a pickle but no sausages,&#34; Brutal said.</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="205" height="19" font="3">&#34;No sausages,&#34; I agreed.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="431" height="19" font="3">&#34;Course not,&#34; Dean said. &#34;He fed those to the dog.&#34;</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, that's what the prosecutor said at the trial,&#34; I agreed, &#34;but if Coffey opened his lunch and fed the</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">sausages to the dog, how'd he tie the newspaper back up again with that butcher's twine? I don't know</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">when he even would have had the chance, but leave that out of it, for the time being. This man can't even</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="219" height="19" font="3">tie a simple granny knot!&#34;</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">There was a long moment of thunderstruck silence, broken at last by Brutus. &#34;Holy shit,&#34; he said in a low</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="460" height="19" font="3">voice. &#34;How come no one brought that up at the trial?&#34;</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nobody thought of it,&#34; I said, and found myself again thinking of Hammersmith, the reporter -</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Hammersmith who had been to college in Bowling Green, Hammersmith who liked to think of himself</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">as enlightened, Hammersmith who had told me that mongrel dogs and Negroes were about the same, that</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">either might take a chomp out of you suddenly, and for no reason. Except he kept calling them your</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Negroes, as if they were still property ... but not his property. No, not his. Never his. And at that time, the</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">South was full of Hammersmiths. - Nobody was really <i>equipped</i> to think of it, Coffey's own attorney</text>

<text top="98" left="15" width="285" height="19" font="3">simultaneously joshing and awed.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, put a cork in it,&#34; I said. &#34;I wouldn't have thought of it either, if I hadn't put together what he told</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Deputy McGee that day with what he said after he cured my infection, and what he said after he healed</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="100" height="19" font="3">the mouse.&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="180" height="19" font="3">&#34;What?&#34; Dean asked.</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;When I went into his cell, it was like I was hypnotized. I didn't feel like I could have stopped doing what</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="238" height="19" font="3">he wanted, even if I'd tried.&#34;</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="625" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't like the sound of that,&#34; Harry said, and shifted uneasily in his seat.</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;I asked him what he wanted, and he said 'Just to help.' I remember that very clearly. And when it was</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="627" height="19" font="3">over and I was better, he knew. 'I helped it,' he said. 'I helped it, didn't I?, &#34;</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Brutal was nodding. &#34;Just like with the mouse. You said 'You helped it,' and Coffey said it back to you</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="728" height="19" font="3">like he was a parrot. 'I helped Del's mouse.' Is that when you knew? It was, wasn't it?.&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, I guess so. I remembered what he said to McGee when McGee asked him what had happened. It</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">was in every story about the murders, just about. 'I couldn't help it. I tried to take it back, but it was too</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">late.' A man saying a thing like that with two little dead girls in his arms, them white and blonde, him as</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">big as a house, no wonder they got it wrong. They heard what he was saying in a way that would agree</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">with what they were seeing, and what they were seeing was black. They thought he was confessing, that</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">he was saying he'd had a compulsion to take those girls, rape them, and kill them. That he'd come to his</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="200" height="19" font="3">senses and tried to stop.</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="393" height="19" font="3">&#34;But by then it was too late,&#34; Brutal murmured</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. Except what he was really trying to tell them was that he'd found them, tried to heal them - to bring</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="557" height="19" font="3">them back - and had no success. They were too far gone in death.&#34;</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="724" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul, do you believe that?&#34; Dean asked. &#34;Do you really, honest-to-God believe that?&#34;</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">I examined my heart as well as I could one final time, then nodded my head. Not only did I know it now,</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">there was an intuitive part of me that had known something wasn't right with John Coffey's situation</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">from the very beginning, when Percy had come onto the block hauling on Coffey's arm and blaring</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dead man walking! - at the top of his lungs. I had shaken hands with him, hadn't I? I had never shaken</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="666" height="19" font="3">the hand of a man coming on the Green Mile before, but I had shaken Coffey's.</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="341" height="19" font="3">&#34;Jesus,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Good Jesus Christ.&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="472" height="19" font="3">&#34;Your shoe's one thing,&#34; Harry said. &#34;What's the other?&#34;</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not long before the posse found Coffey and the girls, the men came out of the woods near the south</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">bank of the Trapingus River. They found a patch of flattened-down grass there, a lot of blood, and the</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="787" height="19" font="3">rest of Cora Detterick's nightie. The dogs got confused for a bit. Most wanted to go southeast,</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">downstream along the bank. But two of them-the coon-dogs - wanted to go upstream. &#34;Bobo Marchant</text>

<page number="141" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">was running the dogs, and when he save the coonies a sniff of the nightgown, they turned with the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="65" height="19" font="3">others.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;The coonies got mixed up, didn't they?&#34; Brutal asked. A strange, sickened little smile was playing</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">around the corners of his mouth. &#34;They ain't built to be trackers, strictly speaking , and they got mixed up</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="195" height="19" font="3">on what their job was.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="42" height="19" font="3">'Yes.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="217" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't get it,&#34; Dean said.</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;The coonies forgot whatever it was Bobo ran under their noses to get them started,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;By the</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">time they came out on the riverbank, the coonies were tracking <i>the killer,</i> not the girls. That wasn't a</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="3">problem as long as the killer and the girls were together, but ...&#34;</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="560" height="19" font="3">The light was dawning in Dean's eyes. Harry had already gotten it.</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;When you think about it,&#34; I said, &#34;you wonder how anybody, even a jury wanting to pin the crime on a</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">wandering black fellow, could have believed John Coffey was their man for even a minute. Just the idea</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">of keeping the dog quiet with food until he could snap its neck would have been beyond Coffey.</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;He was never any closer to the Detterick farm than the south bank of the Trapingus, that's what I think.</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Six or more miles away. He was just mooning along, maybe meaning to go down to the railroad tracks</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">and catch a freight to somewhere else-when they come off the trestle, they're going slow enough to</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="392" height="19" font="3">hop-when he heard a commotion to the north.&#34;</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="225" height="19" font="3">&#34;The killer?&#34; Brutal asked.</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;The killer. He might have raped them already, or maybe the rape was what Coffey heard. In any case,</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">that bloody patch in the grass was where the killer finished the business; dashed their heads together,</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="318" height="19" font="3">dropped them, and then hightailed it.&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="696" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hightailed it northwest,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;The direction the coon-dogs wanted to go.&#34;</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Right. John Coffey comes through a stand of alders that grows a little way southeast of the spot where</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">the girls were left, probably curious about all the noise, and he finds their bodies. One of them might still</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">have been alive; I suppose it's possible both of them were, although not for much longer. John Coffey</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">wouldn't have known if they were dead, that's for sure. All he knows is that he's got a healing power in</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">his hands, and he tried to use it on Cora and Kathe Detterick. When it didn't work, he broke down, crying</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="392" height="19" font="3">and hysterical. Which is how they found him.&#34;</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">&#34;Why didn't he stay there, where he found them?&#34; Brutal asked. &#34;Why take them south along the</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="189" height="19" font="3">riverbank? Any idea?&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;I bet he did stay put, at first,&#34; I said. &#34;At the trial, they kept talking about a big trampled area, all the</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="428" height="19" font="3">grass squashed flat. And John Coffey's a big man.&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey's a fucking giant,&#34; Harry said, pitching his voice very low so my wife wouldn't hear him</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="303" height="19" font="3">cuss if she happened to be listening.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe he panicked when he saw that what he was doing wasn't working. Or maybe he got the idea that</text>
</page>
<page number="142" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">the killer was still there, in the woods upstream, watching him. Coffey's big, you know, but not real</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="704" height="19" font="3">brave. Harry, remember him asking if we left a light on in the block after bedtime?&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah. I remember thinking how funny that was, what with the size of him.&#34; Harry looked shaken and</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="93" height="19" font="3">thoughtful.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="505" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, if he didn't kill the little girls, who did?&#34; Dean asked.</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">I shook my head. &#34;Someone else. Someone white would be my best guess. The prosecutor made a big</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">deal about how it would have taken a strong man to kill a dog as big as the one the Dettericks kept, but-&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's crap,&#34; Brutus rumbled. &#34;A strong twelve year-old girl could break a big dog's neck, if she took the</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">dog by surprise and knew where to grab. If Coffey didn't do it, it could have been damned near anyone ...</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="386" height="19" font="3">any man, that is. We'll probably never know.&#34;</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="273" height="19" font="3">I said, &#34;Unless he does it again.&#34;</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="748" height="19" font="3">&#34;We wouldn't know even then, if he did it down Texas or over in California,&#34; Harry said.</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Brutal leaned back, screwed his fists into his eyes like a tired child, then dropped them into his lap again.</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;This is a nightmare,&#34; he said. &#34;We've got a man who may be innocent - who probably is innocent - and</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">he's going to walk the Green Mile just as sure as God made tall trees and little fishes. What are we</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">supposed to do about it? If we start in with that healing-fingers shit, everyone is going to laugh their</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="506" height="19" font="3">asses off, and he'll end up in the Fry-O-Lator just the same.&#34;</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let's worry about that later,&#34; I said, because I didn't have the slightest idea how to answer him. &#34;The</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">question right now is what we do - or don't do - about Melly. I'd say step back and take a few days to</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">think it over, but I believe every day we wait raises the chances that he won't be able to help her.&#34;</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Remember him holding his hands out for the mouse?&#34; Brutal asked. &#34;'Give im to me while there's still</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="323" height="19" font="3">time,' he said. <i>While there's still time.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="120" height="19" font="3">&#34;I remember.&#34;</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Brutal considered, then nodded. &#34;I'm in. I feel bad about Del, too, but mostly I think I just want to see</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="614" height="19" font="3">what happens when he touches her. Probably nothing will, but maybe ...&#34;</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;I doubt like hell we even get the big dummy off the block,&#34; Harry said, then sighed and nodded. &#34;But</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="268" height="19" font="3">who gives a shit? Count me in.&#34;</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">&#34;Me, too,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Who stays on the block, Paul? Do we draw straws for it?&#34;</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, sir,&#34; I said. &#34;No straws. You stay.&#34;</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just like that? The hell you say!&#34; Dean replied, hurt and angry. He whipped off his spectacles and began</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="601" height="19" font="3">to polish them furiously on his shirt. &#34;What kind of a bum deal is that?&#34;</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;The kind you get if you're young enough to have kids still in school,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Harry and me's</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">bachelors. Paul's married, but his kids are grown and off on their own, at least. This is a <i>mucho</i> crazy</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">stunt we're planning here; I think we're almost sure to get caught.&#34; He gazed at me soberly. &#34;One thing</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">you didn't mention, Paul, is that if we do manage to get him out of the slam and then Coffey's healing</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">fingers don't work, Hal Moores is apt to turn us in himself.&#34; He gave me a chance to reply to this, maybe</text>

<text top="59" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">get me wrong, you're apt to lose your job, too, but at least you'd have a chance to get clear of prison if the</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">heat really came down. Percy's going to think it was a prank; if you're on the duty desk, you can say you</text>

<text top="146" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;I still don't like it,&#34; Dean said, but it was clear he'd go along with it, like it or not. The thought of his</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="550" height="19" font="3">kiddies had convinced him. &#34;And it's to be tonight? You're sure?&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;If we're going to do it, it had <i>better</i> be tonight,&#34; Harry said. &#34;If I get a chance to think about it, I'll most</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="185" height="19" font="3">likely lose my nerve.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="770" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let me be the one to go by the infirmary,&#34; Dean said. &#34;I can do that much at least, can't I?&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="657" height="19" font="3">&#34;As long as you can do what needs doing without getting caught,&#34; Brutal said.</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Dean looked offended, and I clapped him on the shoulder. &#34;As soon after you clock in as you can ... all</text>

<text top="413" left="15" width="89" height="19" font="3">&#34;You bet.&#34;</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">My wife popped her head through the door as if I'd given her a cue to do so. &#34;Who's for more iced tea?&#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="390" height="19" font="3">she asked brightly. &#34;What about you, Brutus?&#34;</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, thanks,&#34; he said. &#34;What I'd like is a good hard knock of whiskey, but under the circumstances, that</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="222" height="19" font="3">might not be a good idea.&#34;</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Janice looked at me; smiling mouth, worried eyes. &#34;What are you getting these boys into, Paul?&#34; But</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">before I could even think of framing a reply, she raised her hand and said, &#34;Never mind, I don't want to</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">know.&#34;</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>3.</b></text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Later, long after the others were gone and while I was dressing for work, she took me by the arm, swung</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="484" height="19" font="3">me around, and looked into my eyes with fierce intensity.</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="188" height="19" font="3">&#34;Melinda?&#34; she asked.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">I nodded.</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Can you do something for her, Paul? Really do something for her, or is it all wishful dreaming brought</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="269" height="19" font="3">on by what you saw last night?&#34;</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">I thought of Coffey's eyes, of Coffey's hands, and of the hypnotized way I'd gone to him when he'd</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">wanted me. I thought of him holding out his hands for Mr. Jingles's broken, dying body. <i>While there's</i></text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="731" height="19" font="4"><i>still time,</i> he had said. And the black swirling things that turned white and disappeared.</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think we might be the only chance she has left,&#34; I said at last.</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then take it,&#34; she said, buttoning the front of my new fall coat. It had been in the closet since my</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">birthday at the beginning of September, but this was only the third or fourth time I'd actually worn it.</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="81" height="19" font="3">&#34;Take it.&#34;</text>

<page number="144" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="371" height="19" font="3">And she practically pushed me out the door.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>4.</b></text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I clocked in that night - in many ways the strangest night of my entire life - at twenty past six. I thought I</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">could still smell the faint, lingering odor of burned flesh on the air. It had to be an illusion - the doors to</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">the outside, both on the block and in the storage room, had been open most of the day, and the previous</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">two shifts had spent hours scrubbing in there - but that didn't change what my nose was telling me, and I</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">didn't think I could have eaten any dinner even if I hadn't been scared almost to death about the evening</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="142" height="19" font="3">which lay ahead.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Brutal came on the block at quarter to seven, Dean at ten 'til. I asked Dean if he would go over to the</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">infirmary and see if they had a heating pad for my back, which I seemed to have strained that early</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">morning, helping to carry Delacroix's body down into the tunnel. Dean said he'd be happy to. I believe he</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="3">wanted to tip me a wink, but restrained himself.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="365" height="19" font="3">Harry clocked on at three minutes to seven.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="178" height="19" font="3">&#34;The truck?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="217" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where we talked about.&#34;</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">So far, so good. There followed a little passage of time when we stood by the duty desk, drinking coffee</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">and studiously not mentioning what we were all thinking and hoping: that Percy was late, that maybe</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Percy wasn't going to show up at all. Considering the hostile reviews he'd gotten on the way he'd handled</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="394" height="19" font="3">the electrocution, that seemed at least possible.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">But Percy apparently subscribed to that old axiom about how you should get right back on the horse that</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">had thrown you, because here he came through the door at six minutes past seven, resplendent in his blue</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">uniform, with his sidearm on one hip and his hickory stick in its ridiculous custom-made holster on the</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">other. He punched his time-card, then looked around at us warily (except for Dean, who hadn't come</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="639" height="19" font="3">back from the infirmary yet). &#34;My starter busted,&#34; he said. &#34;I had to crank.-&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="250" height="19" font="3">&#34;Aw,&#34; Harry said, &#34;po' baby.&#34;</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Should have stayed home and got the cussed thing fixed,&#34; Brutal said blandly. &#34;We wouldn't want you</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="362" height="19" font="3">straining your arm none, would we, boys?&#34;</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you?&#34; Percy sneered, but I thought he seemed reassured by the relative</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">mildness of Brutal's response. That was good. For the next few hours we'd have to walk a line with him -</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">not too hostile, but not too friendly, either. After last night, he'd find anything even approaching warmth</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">suspect. We weren't going to get him with his guard down, we all knew that, but I thought we could catch</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">him with it a long piece from all the way up if we played things just right. It was important that we move</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="793" height="19" font="3">fast, but it was also important - to me, at least - that nobody be hurt. Not even Percy Wetmore.</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="350" height="19" font="3">Dean came back and gave me a little nod.</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy,&#34; I said, &#34;I want you to go on in the storeroom and mop down the floor. Stairs to the tunnel, too.</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="385" height="19" font="3">Then you can write your report on last night.&#34;</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">&#34;That should be creative,&#34; Brutal remarked, hooking his thumbs into his belt and looking up at the</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="62" height="19" font="3">ceiling.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;You guys are funnier'n a fuck in church,&#34; Percy said, but beyond that he didn't protest. Didn't even point</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">out the obvious, which was that the floor in there had already been washed at least twice that day. My</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="503" height="19" font="3">guess is that he was glad for the chance to be away from us.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">I went over the previous shift report, saw nothing that concerned me, and then took a walk down to</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Wharton's cell. He was sitting there on his bunk with his knees drawn up and his arms clasped around his</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">shins, looking at me with a bright, hostile smile.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, if it ain't the big boss,&#34; he said. &#34;Big as life and twice as ugly. You look happier'n a pig kneedeep</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="728" height="19" font="3">in shit, Boss Edgecombe. Wife give your pecker a pull before you left home, did she?&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;How you doing, Kid?&#34; I asked evenly, and at that he brightened for real. He let go of his legs, stood up,</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="636" height="19" font="3">and stretched. His smile broadened, and some of the hostility went out of it.</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, damn!&#34; he said. &#34;You got my name right for once! What's the matter with you, Boss Edgecombe?</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="183" height="19" font="3">You sick or sumpin?&#34;</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">No, not sick. I'd <i>been</i> sick, but John Coffey had taken care of that. His hands no longer knew the trick of</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="656" height="19" font="3">tying a shoe, if they ever had, but they knew other tricks. Yes indeed they did.</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;My friend,&#34; I told him, &#34;if you want to be a Billy the Kid instead of a Wild Bill, it's all the same to me.&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">He puffed visibly, like one of those loathsome fish that live in South American rivers and can sting you</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">almost to death with the spines along their backs and sides. I dealt with a lot of dangerous men during my</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">time on the Mile, but few if any so repellent as William Wharton, who considered himself a great outlaw,</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">but whose jailhouse behavior rarely rose above pissing or spitting through the bars of his cell. So far we</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">hadn't given him the awed respect he felt was his by right, but on that particular night I wanted him</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="637" height="19" font="3">tractable. If that meant lathering on the softsoap, I would gladly lather it on.</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;I got a lot in common with the Kid, and you just better believe it,&#34; Wharton said. &#34;I didn't get here for</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">stealing candy out of a dimestore.&#34; As proud as a man who's been conscripted into the Heroes' Brigade of</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">the French Foreign Legion instead of one whose ass has been slammed into a cell seventy long steps</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="384" height="19" font="3">from the electric chair. &#34;Where's my supper?&#34;</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, Kid, report says you had it at five-fifty. Meatloaf with gravy, mashed, peas. You don't con me</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="88" height="19" font="3">that easy.&#34;</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">He laughed expansively and sat down on his bunk again. &#34;Put on the radio, then.&#34; He said radio in the</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">way people did back then when they were joking, so it rhymed with the fifties slang word &#34;Daddy-O.&#34;</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">It's funny how much a person can remember about times when his nerves were tuned so tight they almost</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="44" height="19" font="3">sang.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe later, big boy,&#34; I said. I stepped away from his cell and looked down the corridor. Brutal had</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">strolled down to the far end, where he checked to make sure the restraint-room door was on the single</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">lock instead of the double. I knew it was, because I'd already checked it myself. Later on, we'd want to be</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">able to open that door as quick as we could. There would be no time spent emptying out the attic-type</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">rick-rack that had accumulated in there over the years; we'd taken it out, sorted it, and stored it in other</text>

<text top="59" left="15" width="609" height="19" font="3">was apt to get a lot of use, at least until &#34;Billy the Kid&#34; strolled the Mile.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">John Coffey, who would usually have been lying down at this time, long, thick legs dangling and face to</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">the wall, was sitting on the end of his bunk with his hands clasped, watching Brutal with an alertness - a</text>

<text top="185" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Brutal tried the door to the restraint room, then came on back up the Mile. Hie glanced at Coffey as he</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">passed Coffey's cell, and Coffey said a curious thing: &#34;Sure. I'd <i>like</i> a ride.&#34; As if responding to</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="225" height="19" font="3">something Brutal had said.</text>

<text top="617" left="15" width="115" height="19" font="3">the place up.&#34;</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Toot smiled his peculiarly unpleasant smile, toothless and sunken, and made a business of sniffing the</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="572" height="19" font="3">air. &#34;That ain't me you smell,&#34; he said. &#34;That be Del, sayin so-long.&#34;</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Cackling, he rolled his cart out the door and into the exercise yard. And he went on rolling it for another</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">ten years, long after I was gone - hell, long after Cold Mountain was gone - selling Moon Pies and pops</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">to the guards and prisoners who could afford them. Sometimes even now I hear him in my dreams,</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="472" height="19" font="3">yelling that he's fryin, he's fryin, he's a done tom turkey.</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">The time stretched out after Toot was gone, the clock seeming to crawl. We had the radio for an hour and</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">a half, Wharton braying laughter at Fred Allen and <i>Allen's Alley,</i> even though I doubt like hell he</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">understood many of the jokes. John Coffey sat on the end of his bunk, hands clasped, eyes rarely leaving</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">whoever was at the duty desk. I have seen men waiting that way in bus stations for their buses to be</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="55" height="19" font="3">called.</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Percy came in from the storage room around quarter to eleven and handed me a report which had been</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">laboriously written in pencil. Eraser-crumbs lay over the sheet of paper in gritty smears. He saw me run</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">my thumb over one of these, and said hastily: &#34;That's just a first pass, like. I'm going to copy it over.</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="175" height="19" font="3">What do you think?&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">What I thought was that it was the most outrageous goddam whitewash I'd read in all my born days.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="548" height="19" font="3">What I told him was that it was fine, and he went away, satisfied.</text>

<page number="147" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Dean and Harry played cribbage, talking too loud, squabbling over the count too often, and looking at the</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">crawling hands of the clock every five seconds or so. On at least one of their games that night, they</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">appeared to go around the board three times instead of twice. There was so much tension in the air that I</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">felt I could almost have carved it like clay, and the only people who didn't seem to feel it were Percy and</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="84" height="19" font="3">Wild Bill.</text>
<text top="173" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">Then it got to be ten of twelve, I could stand it no longer and gave Dean a little nod. He went into my</text>
<text top="197" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">office with a bottle of R.C. Cola bought off Toot's cart, and came back out a minute or two later. The</text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="632" height="19" font="3">cola was now in a tin cup, which a prisoner can't break and then slash with.</text>
<text top="260" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">I took it and glanced around. Harry, Dean, and Brutal were all watching me. So, for that matter, was John</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Coffey. Not Percy, though. Percy had returned to the storage room, where he probably felt more at ease</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">on this particular night. I gave the tin cup a quick sniff and got no odor except for the R.C., which had an</text>
<text top="332" left="15" width="442" height="19" font="3">odd but pleasant cinnamon smell back in those days.</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I took it down to Wharton's cell. He was lying on his bunk. He wasn't masturbating - yet, anyway - but</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">had raised quite a boner inside his shorts and was giving it a good healthy twang every now and again,</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="500" height="19" font="3">like a dopey bass-fiddler hammering an extrathick E-string.</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="110" height="19" font="3">&#34;Kid,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="227" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't bother me,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay,&#34; I agreed. &#34;I brought you a pop for behaving like a human being all night - damn near a record for</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="282" height="19" font="3">you - but I'll just drink it myself.&#34;</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">I made as if to do just that, raising the tin cup (battered all up and down the sides from many angry</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">bangings on many sets of cell bars) to my lips. Wharton was off the bunk in a flash, which didn't surprise</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">me. It wasn't a high-risk bluff; most deep cons - lifers, rapists, and the men slated for Old Sparky - are</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="438" height="19" font="3">pigs for their sweets, and this one was no exception.</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Gimme that, you clunk,&#34; Wharton said. He spoke as if he were the foreman and I was just another lowly</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="221" height="19" font="3">peon. &#34;Give it to the Kid.&#34;</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">I held it just outside the bars, letting him be the one to reach through. Doing it the other way around is a</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">recipe for disaster, as any long-time prison screw will tell you. That was the kind of stuff we thought of</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">without even knowing we were thinking of it - the way we knew not to let the cons call us by our first</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">names, the way we knew that the sound of rapidly jingling keys meant trouble on the block, because it</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">was the sound of a prison guard running and prison guards <i>never</i> run unless there's trouble in the valley.</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">Stuff Percy Wetmore was never going to get wise to.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Tonight, however, Wharton had no interest in grabbing or choking. He snatched the tin cup, downed the</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">pop in three long swallows, then voiced a resounding belch. <i>&#34;Excellent!&#34;</i> he said.</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="227" height="19" font="3">I held my hand out. &#34;Cup.&#34;</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="568" height="19" font="3">He held it for a moment, teasing with his eyes. &#34;Suppose I keep it?&#34;</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">I shrugged. &#34;We'll come in and take it back. You'll go down to the little room. And you will have drunk</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="472" height="19" font="3">your last R.C. Unless they serve it down in hell, that is.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="148" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">His smile faded. &#34;I don't like jokes about hell, screwtip.&#34; He thrust the cup out through the bars. &#34;Here.</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="73" height="19" font="3">Take it.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">I took it. From behind me, Percy said: &#34;Why in God's name did you want to give a lugoon like him a</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="95" height="19" font="3">soda-pop?&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Because it was loaded with enough infirmary dope to put him on his back for forty-eight hours, and he</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="256" height="19" font="3">never tasted a thing, I thought.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">&#34;With Paul,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;the quality of mercy is not strained; it droppeth like the gentle rain from</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="73" height="19" font="3">heaven.&#34;</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="261" height="19" font="3">&#34;Huh?&#34; Percy asked, frowning.</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;Means he's a soft touch. Always has been, always will be. Want to play a game of Crazy Eights, Percy?&#34;</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="781" height="19" font="3">Percy snorted. &#34;Except for Go Fish and Old Maid, that's the stupidest card-game ever made.&#34;</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="674" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's why I thought you might like a few hands,&#34; Brutal said, smiling sweetly.</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Everybody's a Wisenheimer,&#34; Percy said, and sulked off into my office. I didn't care much for the little</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="518" height="19" font="3">rat parking his ass behind my desk, but I kept my mouth shut.</text>
<text top="506" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">The clock crawled. Twelve-twenty; twelve-thirty. At twelve-forty, John Coffey got up off his bunk and</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">stood at his cell door, hands grasping the bars loosely. Brutal and I walked down to Wharton's cell and</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">looked in. He lay there on his bunk, smiling up at the ceiling. His eyes were open, but they looked like</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">big glass balls. One hand lay on his chest; the other dangled limply off the side of his bunk, knuckles</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="156" height="19" font="3">brushing the floor.</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Gosh,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;from Billy the Kid to Willie the Weeper in less than an hour. I wonder how many</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="395" height="19" font="3">of those morphine pills Dean put in that tonic.&#34;</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Enough,&#34; I said. There was a little tremble in my voice. I don't know if Brutal heard it, but I sure did.</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="276" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on. We're going to do it.&#34;</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="470" height="19" font="3">&#34;You don't want to wait for beautiful there to pass out?&#34;</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="572" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's passed out now, Brute. He's just too buzzed to close his eyes.&#34;</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're the boss.&#34; He looked around for Harry, but Harry was already there. Dean was sitting boltupright</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">at the duty desk, shuffling the cards so hard and fast it was a wonder they didn't catch fire, throwing a</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="778" height="19" font="3">little glance to his left, at my office, with every flutter-shuffle. Keeping an eye out for Percy.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is it time?&#34; Harry asked. His long, horsey face was very pale above his blue uniform blouse, but he</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="162" height="19" font="3">looked determined.</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="463" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said. &#34;If we're going through with it, it's time.&#34;</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">Harry crossed himself and kissed his thumb. Then he went down to the restraint room, unlocked it, and</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">came back with the straitjacket. He handed it to Brutal. The three of us walked up the Green Mile. Coffey</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">stood at his cell door, watching us go, and said not a word. When we reached the duty desk, Brutal put</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">the straitjacket behind his back, which was broad enough to conceal it easily.</text>
</page>
<page number="149" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="44" left="15" width="634" height="19" font="3">&#34;Luck,&#34; Dean said. He was as pale as Harry, and looked just as determined.</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">Percy was behind my desk, all right, sitting in my chair and frowning over the book he'd been toting</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="784" height="19" font="3">around with him the last few nights - not Argosy or <i>Stag</i> but <i>Caring for the Mental Patient in</i></text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="4"><i>Institutions.</i> You would have thought, from the guilty, worried glance he threw our way when we walked</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">in, that it had been <i>The Last Days of Sodom and Gomorrah.</i></text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="578" height="19" font="3">&#34;What?&#34; he asked, closing the book in a hurry. &#34;What do you want?&#34;</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="353" height="19" font="3">&#34;To talk to you, Percy,&#34; I said, &#34;that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">But he read a hell of a lot more than a desire to talk on our faces, and was up like a shot, hurrying - not</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">quite running, but almost - toward the open door to the storeroom. He thought we had come to give him a</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="519" height="19" font="3">ragging at the very least, and more likely a good roughing up.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">Harry cut around behind him and blocked the doorway, arms folded on his chest.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="662" height="19" font="3">&#34;Saaay!&#34; Percy turned to me, alarmed but trying not to show it. &#34;What is this?&#34;</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't ask, Percy,&#34; I said. I had thought I'd be okay - back to normal, anyway-once we actually got</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">rolling on this crazy business, but it wasn't working out that way. I couldn't believe what I was doing. It</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">was like a bad dream. I kept expecting my wife to shake me awake and tell me I'd been moaning in my</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="403" height="19" font="3">sleep. &#34;It'll be easier if you just go along with it.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's Howell got behind his back?&#34; Percy asked in a ragged voice. turning to get a better look at</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="58" height="19" font="3">Brutal.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="418" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Well ... <i>this, I suppose-!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">He whipped the straitjacket out and shook it beside one hip, like a matador shaking his cape to make the</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="99" height="19" font="3">bull charge.</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Percy's eyes widened, and he lunged. He meant to run, but Harry grabbed his arms and a lunge was all he</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="170" height="19" font="3">was able to manage.</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let go of me!&#34; Percy shouted, trying to jerk out of Harry's grasp. It wasn't going to happen, Harry</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">outweighed him by almost a hundred pounds and had the muscles of a man who spent most of his spare</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">time plowing and chopping, but Percy gave it a good enough effort to drag Harry halfway across the</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">room and to rough up the unpleasant green carpet I kept meaning to replace. For a moment I thought he</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="607" height="19" font="3">was even going to get one arm free panic can be one hell of a motivator.</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">&#34;Settle down, Percy,&#34; I said. &#34;It'll go easier if - &#34;</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't you tell me to settle down, you ignoramus!&#34; Percy yelled, jerking his shoulders and trying to free</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">his arms. &#34;Just get away from me! All of you! I know people! Big people! If you don't quit this, you'll</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="651" height="19" font="3">have to go all the way to South Carolina just to get a meal in a soup kitchen!&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">He gave another forward lunge and ran his upper thighs into my desk. The book he'd been reading,</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="4"><i>Caring for the Mental Patient in Institutions,</i> gave a jump, and the smaller, pamphlet-sized book which</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">had been hidden inside it popped out. No wonder Percy had looked guilty when we came in. It wasn't</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="4"><i>The Last Days of Sodom and Gomorrah,</i> but it was the one we sometimes gave to inmates who were</text>

<page number="150" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">feeling especially horny and who had been well-behaved enough to deserve a treat. I've mentioned it, I</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">think - the little cartoon book where Olive Oyl does everybody except Sweet Pea, the kid.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I found it sad that Percy had been in my office and pursuing such pallid porn, and Harry - what I could</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">see of him from over Percy's straining shoulder - looked mildly disgusted, but Brutal hooted with</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="603" height="19" font="3">laughter, and that took the fight out of Percy, at least for the time being.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh Poicy,&#34; he said. &#34;What would your mother say? For that matter, what would the governor say?&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="649" height="19" font="3">Percy was blushing a dark red. &#34;Just shut up. And leave my mother out of it.&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Brutal tossed me the straitjacket and pushed his face up into Percy's. &#34;Sure thing. Just stick out your arms</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="144" height="19" font="3">like a good boy.&#34;</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Percy's lips were trembling, and his eyes were too bright. He was, I realized, on the verge of tears. &#34;I</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">won't,&#34; he said in a childish, trembling voice, &#34;and you can't make me.&#34; Then he raised his voice and</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">began to scream for help. Harry winced and so did I. If we ever came close to just dropping the whole</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">thing, it was then. We might have, except for Brutal. He never hesitated. He stepped behind Percy so he</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">was shoulder to shoulder with Harry, who still had Percy's hands pinned behind him. Brutal reached up</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="288" height="19" font="3">and took Percy's ears in his hands.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;Stop that yelling,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Unless you want to have a pair of the world's most unique teabag</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="77" height="19" font="3">caddies.&#34;</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Percy quit yelling for help and just stood there, trembling and looking down at the cover of the crude</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">cartoon book, which showed Popeye and Olive doing it in a creative way I had heard of but never tried.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oooh, Popeye!&#34; read the balloon over Olive's head. &#34;Uck-uck-uck-uck!&#34; read the one over Popeye's. He</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="223" height="19" font="3">was still smoking his pipe.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="767" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hold out your arms,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;and let's have no more foolishness about it. Do it now.&#34;</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="467" height="19" font="3">&#34;I won't,&#34; Percy said. &#34;I won't, and you can't make me.&#34;</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're dead wrong about that, you know,&#34; Brutal said, then clamped down on Percy's ears and twisted</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">them the way you might twist the dials on an oven. An oven that wasn't cooking the way you wanted,</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Percy let out a miserable shriek of pain and surprise that I would have given a great deal not to have</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">heard. It wasn't just pain and surprise, you see; it was understanding. For the first time in his life, Percy</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">was realizing that awful things didn't just happen to other people, those not fortunate enough to be related</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">to the governor. I wanted to tell Brutal to stop, but of course I couldn't. Things had gone much too far for</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">that. All I could do was to remind myself that Percy had put Delacroix through God knew what agonies</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">simply because Delacroix had laughed at him. The reminder didn't go very far toward soothing the way I</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="617" height="19" font="3">felt. Perhaps it might have, if I'd been built more along the lines of Percy.</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="585" height="19" font="3">&#34;Stick those arms out there, honey,&#34; Brutal said, &#34;or you get another.&#34;</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Harry had already let go of young Mr. Wetmore. Sobbing like a little kid, the tears which had been</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">standing in his eyes now spilling down his cheeks, Percy shot his hands out straight in front of him, like a</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">sleepwalker in a movie comedy. I had the sleeves of the straitjacket up his arms in a trice. I hardly had it</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">over his shoulders before Brutal had let go of Percy's ears and grabbed the straps hanging down from the</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">jacket's cuffs. He yanked Percy's hands around to his sides, so that his arms were crossed tightly on his</text>
</page>
<page number="151" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">chest. Harry, meanwhile, did up the back and snapped the cross-straps. Once Percy gave m and stuck out</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="440" height="19" font="3">his arms, the whole thing took less than ten seconds.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="363" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay, hon,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Forward harch.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">But he wouldn't. He looked at Brutal, then turned his terrified, streaming eyes on me. Nothing about his</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">connections now, or how we'd have to go all the way to South Carolina just to get a free meal; he was far</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">past that.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="672" height="19" font="3">&#34;Please,&#34; he whispered in a hoarse, wet voice. &#34;Don't put me in with him, Paul.&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Then I understood why he had panicked, why he'd fought us so hard. He thought we were going to put</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">him in with Wild Bill Wharton; that his punishment for the dry sponge was to be a dry cornholing from</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">the resident psychopath. Instead of feeling sympathy for Percy at this realization, I felt disgust and a</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">hardening of my resolve. He was, after all, judging us by the way he would have behaved, had our</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="202" height="19" font="3">positions been reversed.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not Wharton,&#34; I said. &#34;The restraint room, Percy. You're going to spend three or four hours in there, all</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">by yourself in the dark, thinking about what you did to Del. It's probably too late for you to learn any</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">new lessons about how people are supposed to behave - Brute thinks so, anyway - but I'm an optimist.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="107" height="19" font="3">Now move.&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">He did, muttering under his breath that we'd be sorry for this, plenty sorry, just wait and see, but on the</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="343" height="19" font="3">whole he seemed relieved and reassured.</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">When we herded him out into the hall, Dean gave us a look of such wide-eyed surprise and dewy</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">innocence that I could have laughed, if the business hadn't been so serious. I've seen better acting in</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="227" height="19" font="3">backwoods Grange revues.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="529" height="19" font="3">&#34;Say, don't you think the joke's gone far enough?&#34; Dean asked.</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;You just shut up, if you know what's good for you,&#34; Brutal growled. These were lines we'd scripted at</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">lunch, and that was just what they sounded like to me, scripted lines, but if Percy was scared enough and</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">confused enough, they still might save Dean Stanton's job in a pinch. I myself didn't think so, but</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">anything was possible. Any time I've doubted that, then or since, I just think about John Coffey, and</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's mouse.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">We ran Percy down the Green Mile, him stumbling and gasping for us to slow down, he was going to go</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">flat on his face if we didn't slow down. Wharton was on his bunk, but we went by too fast for me to see if</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">he was awake or asleep. John Coffey was standing at his cell door and watching. &#34;You're a bad man and</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="670" height="19" font="3">you deserve to go in that dark place,&#34; he said, but I don't think Percy heard him.</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Into the restraint room we went, Percy's cheeks red and wet with tears, his eyes rolling into their sockets,</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">his pampered locks all flopping down on his forehead. Harry pulled Percy's gun with one hand and his</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">treasured hickory, head-knocker with the other. &#34;You'll get em back, don't worry,&#34; Harry said. He</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="246" height="19" font="3">sounded a trifle embarrassed.</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="379" height="19" font="3">&#34;I wish I could say the same about your job,&#34;</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="554" height="19" font="3">Percy replied. &#34;All your jobs. You can't do this to me! You can't!&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="152" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">He was obviously prepared to go on in that vein for quite awhile, but we didn't have time to listen to his</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">sermon. In my pocket was a roll of friction-tape, the thirties ancestor of the strapping-tape folks use</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">today. Percy saw it and started to back away. Brutal grabbed him from behind and hugged him until I had</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">slapped the tape over his mouth, winding the roll around to the back of his head, just to be sure. He was</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">going to have a few less swatches of hair when the tape came off, and a pair of seriously chapped lips</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="671" height="19" font="3">into the bargain, but I no longer much cared, I'd had a gutful of Percy Wetmore.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">We backed away from him. He stood in the middle of the room, under the caged light, wearing the</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">straitjacket, breathing through flared nostrils, and making muffled <i>mmmph! mmmph!</i> sounds from behind</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="759" height="19" font="3">the tape. All in all, he looked as crazy as any other prisoner we'd ever jugged in that room.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="712" height="19" font="3">&#34;The quieter you are, the sooner you get out,&#34; I said. &#34;Try to remember that, Percy.-&#34;</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="700" height="19" font="3">&#34;And if you get lonely, think about Olive Oyl,&#34; Harry advised. &#34;Uck-uck-uck-uck.&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Then we went out. I closed the door and Brutal locked it. Dean was standing a little way up the Mile, just</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">outside of Coffey's cell. He had already put the master key in the top lock. The four of us looked a each</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">other, no one saying anything. There was no need to. We had started the machinery; all we could do now</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">was hope that it ran the course we had laid out instead of jumping the tracks somewhere along the line.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="464" height="19" font="3">&#34;You still want to go for that ride, John?&#34; Brutal asked,</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="291" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Coffey said. &#34;I reckon.&#34;</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="750" height="19" font="3">&#34;Good,&#34; Dean said. He turned the first lock, removed the key, and seated it in the second.</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do we need to chain you up, John?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="750" height="19" font="3">Coffey appeared to think about this. &#34;Can if you want to,&#34; he said at last. &#34;Don't <i>need</i> to.&#34;</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">I nodded at Brutal, who opened the cell door, then turned to Harry, who was more or less pointing</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="456" height="19" font="3">Percy's .45 at Coffey as Coffey emerged from his cell.</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="241" height="19" font="3">&#34;Give those to Dean,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">Harry blinked like someone awakening from a momentary doze, saw Percy's gun and stick still in his</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">hands, and passed them over to Dean. Coffey, meanle, hulked in the corridor with his bald skull almost</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="356" height="19" font="3">brushing one of the caged overhead lights.</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Standing there with his hands in front of him and his shoulders sloped forward to either side of his barrel</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="744" height="19" font="3">chest, he made me think again, as I had the first time I saw him, of a huge captured bear.</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lock Percy's toys in the duty desk until we get back,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="257" height="19" font="3">&#34;If we get back,&#34; Harry added.</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="436" height="19" font="3">&#34;I will,&#34; Dean said to me, taking no notice of Harry.</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="770" height="19" font="3">&#34;And if someone shows up - probably no one will, but if someone does - what do you say?&#34;</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;That Coffey got upset around midnight,&#34; Dean said. He looked as studious as a college student taking a</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">big exam. &#34;We had to give him the jacket and but him in the restraint room. If there's noise, who ever</text>
</page>
<page number="153" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">hears it'll just think it's him.&#34; He raised his chin to John Coffey. &#34;And what about us?&#34; Brutal asked.</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul's over in Admin, pulling Del's file and going over the witnesses,&#34; Dean said. &#34;It's especially</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">important this time, because the execution was such a balls-up. He said he'd probably be there the rest of</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="692" height="19" font="3">the shift. You and Harry and Percy are over in the laundry, washing your clothes.&#34;</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Well, that was what folks said, anyway. There was a crap-game in the laundry supply room some nights;</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">on others it was blackjack or poker or acey-deucey. Whatever it was, the guards who participated were</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">said to be washing their clothes. There was usually moonshine at these get-togethers, and on occasion a</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">joystick would go around the circle. It's been the same in prisons since prisons were invented, I suppose.</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">When you spend your life taking care of mudmen, you can't help getting a little dirty yourself. In any</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">case, we weren't likely to be checked up on. &#34;Clothes washing&#34; was treated with great discretion at Cold</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="87" height="19" font="3">Mountain.</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;Right with Eversharp,&#34; I said, turning Coffey around and putting him in motion. &#34;And if it all falls</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="452" height="19" font="3">down, Dean, you. don't know nothing about nothing.&#34;</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="220" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's easy to say, but - &#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">At that moment, a skinny arm shot out from between the bars of Wharton's cell and grabbed Coffey's slab</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">of a bicep. We all gasped. Wharton should have been dead to the world, all but comatose, yet here he</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="720" height="19" font="3">stood, swaying back and forth on his feet like a hard-tagged fighter, grinning blearily.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Coffey's reaction was remarkable. He didn't pull away, but he also gasped, pulling air in over his teeth</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">like someone who has touched something cold and unpleasant. His eyes widened, and for a moment he</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">looked as if he and dumb had never even met, let alone got up together every morning and lain down</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">together every night. He had looked <i>alive - there - when</i> he had wanted me to come into his cell so he</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">could touch me. Help me, in Coffeyspeak. He had looked that way again when he'd been holding his</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">hands out for the mouse. Now, for the third time, his face had lit up, as if a spotlight had suddenly been</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">turned on inside his brain. Except it was different this time. It was <i>colder</i> this time, and for the first time I</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">wondered what might happen if John Coffey were suddenly to run amok. We had our guns, we could</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="547" height="19" font="3">shoot him, but actually taking him down might not be easy to do.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">I saw similar thoughts on Brutal's face, but Wharton just went on grinning his stoned, loose-lipped grin -</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where do you think you're going?&#34; he asked. It came out something like <i>Wherra fink yerr gone?</i></text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Coffey stood still, looking first at Wharton, then at Wharton's hand, then back into Wharton's face. I</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">could not read that expression. I mean I could see the intelligence in it, but I couldn't <i>read</i> it. As for</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Wharton, I wasn't worried about him at all. He wouldn't remember any of this later; he was like a drunk</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="187" height="19" font="3">walking in a blackout.</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're a bad man,&#34; Coffey whispered, and I couldn't tell what I heard in his voice - pain or anger or</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">fear. Maybe all three. Coffey looked down at the hand on his arm again, the way you might look at a bug</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="461" height="19" font="3">which could give you a really nasty bite, had it a mind.</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="713" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right, nigger,&#34; Wharton said with a bleary, cocky smile. &#34;Bad as you'd want.&#34;</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">I was suddenly positive that something awful was going to happen, something that would change the</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">planned course of this early morning as completely as a cataclysmic earthquake can change the course of</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="636" height="19" font="3">a river. It was going to happen, and nothing I or any of us did would stop it.</text>
</page>
<page number="154" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Then Brutal reached down, plucked Wharton's hand off John Coffey's arm, and that feeling stopped. It</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">was as if some potentially dangerous circuit had been broken. I told you that in my time in E Block, the</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">governor's line never rang. That was true, but I imagine that if it ever had, I would have felt the same</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">relief that washed over me when Brutal removed Wharton's hand from the big man towering beside me.</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="813" height="19" font="3">Coffey's eyes dulled over at once; it was as if the searchlight inside his head had been turned off.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lie down, Billy,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Take you some rest.&#34; That was my usual line of patter, but under the</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="368" height="19" font="3">circumstances, I didn't mind Brutal using it.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe I will,&#34; Wharton agreed. He stepped back, swayed, almost went over, and caught his balance at</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="673" height="19" font="3">the last second. &#34;Whoo, daddy. Whole room's spinnin around. Like bein drunk.&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">He backed toward his bunk, keeping his bleary regard on Coffey as he went. &#34;Niggers ought to have they</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">own 'lectric chair,&#34; he opined. Then the backs of his knees struck his bunk and he swooped down onto it.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">He was snoring before his head touched his thin prison pillow, deep blue shadows brushed under the</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">hollows of his eyes and the tip of his tongue lolling out.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="591" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ, how'd he get up with so much dope in him?&#34; Dean whispered.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;It doesn't matter, he's out now,&#34; I said. &#34;If he starts to come around, give him another pill dissolved in a</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="586" height="19" font="3">glass of water. No more than one, though. We don't want to kill him.&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Speak for yourself,&#34; Brutal rumbled, and gave Wharton a contemptuous look. &#34;You can't kill a monkey</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="399" height="19" font="3">like him with dope, anyway. They thrive on it.&#34;</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's a bad man,&#34; Coffey said, but in a lower voice this time, as if he was not quite sure of what he was</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">saying, or what it meant.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right,&#34;. Brutal said. &#34;Most wicked. But that's not a problem now, because we ain't going to tango</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">with him anymore.&#34; We started walking again, the four of us surrounding Coffey like worshippers</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">circling an idol that's come to some stumbling kind of half life. &#34;Tell me something, John - do you know</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="214" height="19" font="3">where we're taking you?&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="759" height="19" font="3">&#34;To help,&#34; he said. &#34;I think ... to help ... a lady?&#34; He looked at Brutal with hopeful anxiety.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="654" height="19" font="3">Brutal nodded. &#34;That's right. But how do you know that? How do <i>you know?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">John Coffey considered the question carefully, then shook his head. &#34;I don't know,&#34; he told Brutal. &#34;To</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="577" height="19" font="3">tell you the truth, boss, I don't know much of anything. Never have.&#34;</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="300" height="19" font="3">And with that we had to be content.</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>6.</b></text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I had known the little door between the office and the steps down to the storage room hadn't been built</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">with the likes of Coffey in mind, but I hadn't realized how great the disparity was until he stood before it,</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="216" height="19" font="3">looking at it thoughtfully.</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Harry laughed, but John himself seemed to see no humor in the big man standing in front of the little</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">door. He wouldn't have, of course; even if he'd been quite a few degrees brighter than he was, he</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">wouldn't have. He'd been that big man for most of his life, and this door was just a scrap littler than most.</text>

<page number="155" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">He sat down, scooted through it that way, stood up again, and went down the stairs to where Brutal was</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">waiting for him. There he stopped, looking across the empty room at the platform where Old Sparky</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">waited, as silent - and as eerie - as the throne m the castle of a dead king. The cap hung with hollow</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">jauntiness from one of the back-posts, looking less like a king's crown than a jester's cap, however,</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">something a fool would wear, or shake to make his high-born audience laugh harder at his jokes. The</text>
<text top="158" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">chair's shadow, elongated and spidery, climbed one wall like a threat. And yes, I thought I could still</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">smell burned flesh in the air. It was faint, but I thought it was more than just my imagination.</text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Harry ducked through the door, then me. I didn't like the frozen, wide-eyed way John was looking at Old</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">Sparky. Even less did I like what I saw on his arms when I got close to him: goosebumps.</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, big boy,&#34; I said. I took his wrist and attempted to pull him in the direction of the door leading</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">down to the tunnel. At first he wouldn't go, and I might as well have been trying to pull a boulder out of</text>
<text top="332" left="15" width="266" height="19" font="3">the ground with my bare hands.</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on, John, we gotta go, 'less you want the coach-and-four to turn back into a pumpkin,&#34; Harry said,</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">giving his nervous laugh again. He took John's other arm and tugged, but John still wouldn't come. And</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">then he said something in a low and dreaming voice. It wasn't me he was speaking to, it wasn't any of us,</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="277" height="19" font="3">but I have still never forgotten it.</text>
<text top="482" left="15" width="634" height="19" font="3">&#34;They're still in there. Pieces of them, still in there. I hear them screaming.&#34;</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Harry's nervous chuckles ceased, leaving him with a smile that hung on his mouth like a crooked shutter</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">hangs on an empty house. Brutal gave me a look that was almost terrified, and stepped away from John</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">Coffey. For the second time in less than five minutes, I sensed the whole enterprise on the verge of</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">collapse. This time I was the one who stepped in; when disaster threatened a third time, a little later on, it</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="519" height="19" font="3">would be Harry. We all got our chance that night, believe me.</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">I slid in between John and his view of the chair, standing on my tiptoes to make sure I was completely</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="720" height="19" font="3">blocking his sight-line. Then I snapped my fingers in front of his eyes, twice, sharply.</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on!&#34; I said. &#34;Walk! You said you didn't need to be chained, now prove it! Walk, big boy! Walk,</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="315" height="19" font="3">John Coffey! Over there! That door!&#34;</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="548" height="19" font="3">His eyes cleared. &#34;Yes, boss.&#34; And praise God, he began to walk.</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="562" height="19" font="3">&#34;Look at the door, John Coffey, just at the door and nowhere else.&#34;</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="469" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, boss.&#34; John fixed his eyes obediently on the door.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="241" height="19" font="3">&#34;Brutal,&#34; I said, and pointed.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">He hurried in advance, shaking out his keyring, finding the right one. John kept his gaze fixed on the</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">door to the tunnel and I kept my gaze fixed on John, but from the comer of one eye I could see Harry</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">throwing nervous glances at the chair, as if he had never seen it before in his life.</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="4"><i>There are pieces of them still in there ... I hear them screaming.</i></text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">If that was true, then Eduard Delacroix had to be screaming longest and loudest of all, and I was glad I</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="300" height="19" font="3">couldn't hear what John Coffey did.</text>
</page>
<page number="156" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Brutal opened the door. We went down the stairs with Coffey in the lead. At the bottom, he looked</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">glumly down the tunnel, with its low brick ceiling. He was going to have a crick in his back by the time</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">we got to the other end, unless - I pulled the gurney over. The sheet upon which we'd laid Del had been</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">stripped (and probably incinerated), so the gurney's black leather pads were visible. &#34;Get on,&#34; I told John.</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">He looked at me doubtfully, and I nodded encouragement. &#34;It'll be easier for you and no harder for us.&#34;</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay, Boss Edgecombe.&#34; He sat down, then lay back, looking up at us with worried brown eyes. His</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">feet, clad in cheap prison slippers, dangled almost all the way to the floor. Brutal got in between them</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">and pushed John Coffey along the dank corridor as he had pushed so many others. The only difference</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">was that the current rider was still breathing. About halfway along - under the highway, we would have</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">been, and able to hear the muffled drone of passing cars, had there been any at that hour - John began to</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">smile. &#34;Say,&#34; he said, &#34;this is fun.&#34; He wouldn't think so the next time he rode the gurney; that was the</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">thought which crossed my mind. In fact, the next time he rode the gurney, he wouldn't think or feel</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="793" height="19" font="3">anything. Or would he? There are pieces of them still in there, he had said; he could hear them</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="92" height="19" font="3">screaming.</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="494" height="19" font="3">Walking behind the others and unseen by them, I shivered.</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;I hope you remembered Aladdin, Boss Edgecombe,&#34; Brutal said as we reached the far end of the tunnel.</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't worry,&#34; I said. Aladdin looked no different from the other keys I carried in those days - and I had</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">a bunch that must have weighed four pounds - but it was the master key of master keys, the one that</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">opened everything. There was one Aladdin key for each of the five cellblocks in those days, each the</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">property of the block super. Other guards could borrow it, but only the bull-goose screw didn't have to</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="89" height="19" font="3">sign it out.</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">There was a steel-barred gate at the far end of the tunnel. It always reminded me of pictures I'd seen of</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">old castles; you know, in days of old when knights were bold and chivalry was in flower. Only Cold</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">Mountain was a long way from Camelot. Beyond the gate, a flight of stairs led up to an unobtrusive</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="756" height="19" font="3">bulkhead-style door with signs reading No TRESPASSING and STATE PROPERTY and</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="320" height="19" font="3">ELECTRIFIED WIRE on the outside.</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I opened the gate and Harry swung it back. We went up, John Coffey once more in the lead, shoulders</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">slumped and head bent. At the top, Harry got around him (not without some difficulty, either, although</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">he was the smallest of the three of us) and unlocked the bulkhead. It was heavy. He could move it, but</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="197" height="19" font="3">wasn't able to flip it up.</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Here, boss,&#34; John said. He pushed to the front again -bumping Harry into the wall with one hip as he did</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="365" height="19" font="3">so - and raised the bulkhead with one hand.</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="604" height="19" font="3">You would have thought it was painted cardboard instead of sheet steel.</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Cold night air, moving with the ridge-running wind we would now get most of the time until March or</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">April, blew down into our faces. A swirl of dead leaves came with it, and John Coffey caught one of</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">them with his free hand. I will never forget the way he looked at it, or how he crumpled it beneath his</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="430" height="19" font="3">broad, handsome nose so it would release its smell.</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="424" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Let's go, forward harch.&#34;</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">We climbed out. John lowered the bulkhead and Brutal locked it - no need for the Aladdin key on this</text>
</page>
<page number="157" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">door, but it was needed to unlock the gate in the pole-and-wire cage which surrounded the bulkhead.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hands to your sides while you go through, big fella,&#34; Harry murmured. &#34;Don't touch the wire, if you</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">don't want a nasty bum.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">Then we were clear, standing on the shoulder of the road in a little cluster (three foothills around a</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">mountain is what I imagine we looked like), staring across at the walls and lights and guard-towers of</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Cold Mountain Penitentiary. I could actually see the vague shape of a guard inside one of those towers,</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">blowing on his hands, but only for a moment; the road-facing windows in the towers were small and</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">unimportant. Still, we would have to be very, very quiet. And if a car <i>did</i> come along now, we could be</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="131" height="19" font="3">in deep trouble.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="408" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on,&#34; I whispered. &#34;Lead the way, Harry.&#34;</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">We slunk north along the highway in a little congaline, Harry first, then John Coffey, then Brutal, then</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">me. We breasted the first rise and walked down the other side, where all we could see of the prison was</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="691" height="19" font="3">the bright glow of the lights in the tops of the trees. And still Harry led us onward.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="798" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where'd you park it?&#34; Brutal stage-whispered, vapor puffing from his mouth in a white cloud.</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="110" height="19" font="3">&#34;Baltimore?&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's right up ahead,&#34; Harry replied, sounding nervous and irritable. &#34;Hold your damn water, Brutus.&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">But Coffey, from what I'd seen of him, would have been happy to walk until the sun came up, maybe</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">until it went back down again. He looked everywhere, starting - not in fear but in delight, I am quite sure</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">- when an owl hoo'd. It came to me that, while he might be afraid of the dark inside, he wasn't afraid of it</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">out here, not at all. He was caressing the night, rubbing his senses across it the way a man might rub his</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">face across the swells and concavities of a woman's breasts.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="271" height="19" font="3">&#34;We turn here,&#34; Harry muttered.</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">A little finger of road - narrow, unpaved, weeds running up the center crown-angled off to the right. We</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">turned up this and walked another quarter of a mile. Brutal was beginning to grumble again when Harry</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">stopped, went to the left side of the track, and began to remove sprays of broken-off pine boughs. John</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">and Brutal pitched in, and before I could join them, they had uncovered the dented snout of an old</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="566" height="19" font="3">Farmall truck, its wired-on headlights staring at us like buggy eyes.</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;I wanted to be as careful as I could, you know,&#34; Harry said to Brutal in a thin, scolding voice. &#34;This may</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">be a big joke to you, Brutus Howell, but I come from a very religious family, I got cousins back in the</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">hollers so damn holy they make the Christians look like lions, and if I get caught playing at something</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="90" height="19" font="3">like this-!&#34;</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="425" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's okay,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I'm just jumpy, that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="617" height="19" font="3">&#34;Me too,&#34; Harry said stiffly. &#34;Now if this cussed old thing will just start-&#34;</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">He walked around the hood of the truck, still muttering, and Brutal tipped me a wink. As far as Coffey</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">was concerned, we had ceased to exist. His head was tilted back and he was drinking in the sight of the</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="255" height="19" font="3">stars sprawling across the sky.</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll ride in back with him, if you want,&#34; Brutal offered. Behind us, the Farmall's starter whined briefly,</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">sounding like an old dog trying to find its feet on a cold winter morning; then the engine exploded into</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="767" height="19" font="3">life. Harry raced it once and let it settle into a ragged idle. &#34;No need for both of us to do it.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get up front,&#34; I said. &#34;You can ride with him on the return trip. If we don't end up making that one</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="440" height="19" font="3">locked into the back of our own stagecoach, that is.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't talk that way,&#34; he said, looking genuinely upset. It was as if he had realized for the first time how</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="520" height="19" font="3">serious this would be for us if we were caught. &#34;Christ, Paul!&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="241" height="19" font="3">&#34;Go on,&#34; I said. &#34;In the cab.&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">He did as he was told. I yanked on John Coffey's arm until I could get his attention back to earth for a bit,</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">then led him around to the rear of the truck, which was stake-sided. Harry had draped canvas over the</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">posts, and that would be of some help if we passed cars or trucks going the other way. He hadn't been</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="409" height="19" font="3">able to do anything about the open back, though.</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="249" height="19" font="3">&#34;Upsy-daisy, big boy,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">&#34;Goin for the ride now?&#34;</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="118" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right.&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="786" height="19" font="3">&#34;Good.&#34; He smiled. It was sweet and lovely, that smile, perhaps the more so because it wasn't</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">complicated by much in the way of thought. He got up in back. I followed him, went to the front of the</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">truckbed, and banged on top of the cab. Harry ground the transmission into first and the truck pulled out</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="514" height="19" font="3">of the little bower he had hidden it in, shaking and juddering.</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">John Coffey stood spread-legged in the middle of the truckbed head cocked up at the stars again, smiling</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">broadly, unmindful of the boughs that whipped at him as Harry turned his truck toward the highway.</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Look, boss!&#34; he cried in a low, rapturous voice, pointing up into the black night. &#34;It's Cassie, the lady in</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="147" height="19" font="3">the rockin chair!&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">He was right; I could see her in the lane of stars between the dark bulk of the passing trees. But it wasn't</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">Cassiopeia I thought of when he spoke of the lady in the rocking chair; it was Melinda Moores.</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="758" height="19" font="3">&#34;I see her, John,&#34; I said, and tugged on his arm. &#34;But you have to sit down now, all right?&#34;</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">He sat with his back against the cab, never taking his eyes off the night sky. On his face was a look of</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">sublime unthinking happiness. The Green Mile fell farther behind us with each revolution of the</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">Farmall's bald tires, and for the time being, at least, the seemingly endless flow of John Coffey's tears had</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="71" height="19" font="3">stopped.</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>7.</b></text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">It was twenty-five miles to Hal Moores's house on Chimney Ridge, and in Harry Terwilliger's slow and</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">rattly farm truck, the trip took over an hour. It was an eerie ride, and although it seems to me now that</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">every moment of it is still etched in my memory - every turn, every bump, every dip, the scary times</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">(two of them) when trucks passed us going the other way - I don't think I could come even close to</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">describing how I felt, sitting back there with John Coffey, both of us bundled up like Indians in the old</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="493" height="19" font="3">blankets Harry had been thoughtful enough to bring along.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">It was, most of all, a sense of lostness - the deep and terrible ache a child feels when he realizes he has</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">gone wrong somewhere, all the landmarks are strange, and he no longer knows how to find his way</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">home. I was out in the night with a prisoner - not just any prisoner, but one who had been tried and</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">convicted for the murder of two little girls, and sentenced to die for the crime. My belief that he was</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">innocent wouldn't matter if we were caught; we would go to jail ourselves, and probably Dean Stanton</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">would, too. I had thrown over a life of work and belief because of one bad execution and because I</text>
<text top="179" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">believed the overgrown lummox sitting beside me might be able to cure a woman's inoperable brain</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">tumor. Yet watching john watch the stars, I realized with dismay that I no longer <i>did</i> believe that, if I</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">ever really had; my urinary infection seemed faraway and unimportant now, as such harsh and painful</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">things always do once they are past (if a woman could really remember how bad it hurt to have her first</text>
<text top="275" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">baby, my mother once said, she'd never have a second). As for Mr. Jingles, wasn't it possible, even likely,</text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">that we had been wrong about how badly Percy had hurt him? Or that John - who really did have some</text>
<text top="323" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">kind of hypnotic power, there was no doubt of that much, at least - had somehow fooled us into thinking</text>
<text top="347" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">we'd seen something we hadn't seen at all? Then there was the matter of Hal Moores. On the day I'd</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">surprised him in his office, I'd encountered a palsied, weepy old man. But I didn't think that was the</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">truest side of the warden. I thought the real Warden Moores was the man who'd once broken the wrist of</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">a skatehound who tried to stab him; the man who had pointed out to me with cynical accuracy that</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's nuts were going to cook no matter who was out front on the execution team. Did I think that</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Hal Moores would stand meekly aside and let us bring a convicted child-murderer into his house to lay</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="157" height="19" font="3">hands on his wife?</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">My doubt grew like a sickness as we rode along. I simply did not understand why I had done the things I</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">had, or why I'd persuaded the others to go along with me on this crazy night journey, and I did not</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">believe we had a chance of getting away with it - not a hound's chance of heaven, as the oldtimers used to</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">say. Yet I made no effort to cry it off, either, which I might have been able to do; things wouldn't pass</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">irrevocably out of our hands until we showed up at Moores's house. Something - I think it might have</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">been no more than the waves of exhilaration coming off the giant sitting next to me - kept me from</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">hammering on top of the cab and yelling at Harry to turn around and go back to the prison while there</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="117" height="19" font="3">was still time.</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Such was my frame of mind as we passed off the highway and onto County 5, and from County 5 onto</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Chimney Ridge Road. Some fifteen minutes after that, I saw the shape of a roof blotting out the stars and</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="181" height="19" font="3">knew we had arrived.</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Harry shifted down from second to low (I think he only made it all the way into top gear once during the</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">whole trip). The engine lugged, sending a shudder through the whole truck, as if it, too, dreaded what</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="243" height="19" font="3">now lay directly ahead of us.</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">Harry swung into Moores's gravelled driveway and parked the grumbling truck behind the warden's</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">sensible black Buick. Ahead and slightly to our right was a neat-as-a-pin house in the style which I</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">believe is called Cape Cod. That sort of house should have looked out of place in our ridge country,</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">perhaps, but it didn't. The moon had come up, its grin a little fatter this morning, and by its light I could</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">see that the yard, always so beautifully kept, now looked uncared for. It was just leaves, mostly, that</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">hadn't been raked away. Under normal circumstances that would have been Melly's job, but Melly hadn't</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">been up to any leaf-raking this fall, and she would never see the leaves fall again. That was the truth of</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="654" height="19" font="3">the matter, and I had been mad to think this vacant-eyed idiot could change it.</text>

<page number="160" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">Maybe it still wasn't too late to save ourselves, though. I made as if to get up, the blanket I'd been</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">wearing slipping off my shoulders. I would lean over, tap on the driver's-side window, tell Harry to get</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="166" height="19" font="3">the hell out before -</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">John Coffey grabbed my forearm in one of his hamhock fists, pulling me back down as effortlessly as I</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="660" height="19" font="3">might have done to a toddler. &#34;Look, boss,&#34; he said, pointing. &#34;Someone's up.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I followed the direction of his finger and felt a sinking - not just of the belly, but of the heart. There was a</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">spark of light in one of the back windows. The room where Melinda now spent her days and nights, most</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">likely; she would be no more capable of using the stairs than she would of going out to rake the leaves</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="346" height="19" font="3">which had fallen during the recent storm.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">They'd heard the truck, of course - Harry Terwilliger's goddam Farmall, its engine bellowing and farting</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">down the length of an exhaust pipe unencumbered by anything so frivolous as a muffler. Hell, the</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="567" height="19" font="3">Mooreses probably weren't sleeping that well these nights, anyway.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">A light closer to the front of the house went on (the kitchen), then the living-room overhead, then the one</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">in the front hall, then the one over the stoop. I watched these forward-marching lights the way a man</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">standing against a cement wall and smoking his last cigarette might watch the lockstep approach of the</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">firing squad. Yet I did not entirely acknowledge to myself even then that it was too late until the uneven</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">chop of the Farmall's engine faded into silence, and the doors creaked, and the gravel crunched as Harry</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="157" height="19" font="3">and Brutal got out.</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">John was up, pulling me with him. In the dim light, his face looked lively and eager. Why not? I</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="521" height="19" font="3">remember thinking. Why shouldn't he look eager? He's a fool.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Brutal and Harry were standing shoulder to shoulder at the foot of the truck, like kids in a thunderstorm,</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">and I saw that both of them looked as scared, confused, and uneasy as I felt. That made me feel even</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="55" height="19" font="3">worse.</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">John got down. For him it was more of a step than a jump. I followed, stiff-legged and miserable. I would</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="568" height="19" font="3">have sprawled on the cold gravel if he hadn't caught me by the arm.</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">&#34;This is a mistake,&#34; Brutal said in a hissy little voice. His eyes were very wide and very frightened.</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="414" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ Almighty, Paul, what were we thinking?&#34;</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">&#34;Too late now,&#34; I said. I pushed one of Coffey's hips, and he went obediently enough to stand beside</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">Harry. Then I grabbed Brutal's elbow like this was a date we were on and got the two of us walking</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="751" height="19" font="3">toward the stoop where that light was now burning. &#34;Let me do the talking. Understand?&#34;</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="679" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Right now that's just about the only thing I do understand.&#34;</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">I looked back over my shoulder. &#34;Harry, stay by the truck with him until I call for you. I don't want</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="766" height="19" font="3">Moores to see him until I'm ready.&#34; Except I was never going to be ready. I knew that now.</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Brutal and I had just reached the foot of the steps when the front door was hauled open hard enough to</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">flap the brass knocker against its plate. There stood Hal Moores in blue pajama pants and a strapstyle</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">tee-shirt, his iron-gray hair standing up in tufts and twists. He was a man who had made a thousand</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">enemies over the course of his career, and he knew it. Clasped in his right hand, the abnormally long</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">barrel not quite pointing at the floor, was the pistol which had always been mounted over the mantel. It</text>

<page number="161" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">was the sort of gun known as a Ned Buntline Special, it had been his grandfather's, and right then (I saw</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">this with a further sinking in my gut) it was fully cocked.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who the hell goes there at two-thirty in the goddam morning?&#34; he asked. I heard no fear at all in his</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">voice. And -for the time being, at least - his shakes had stopped. The hand holding the gun was as steady</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="551" height="19" font="3">as a stone. &#34;Answer me, or - &#34; The barrel of the gun began to rise.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Stop it, Warden!&#34; Brutal raised his hands, palms out, toward the man with the gun. I have never heard</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">his voice sound the way it did then; it was as if the shakes turned out of Moores's hands had somehow</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="715" height="19" font="3">found their way into Brutus Howell's throat. &#34;It's us! It's Paul and me and . . . it's us!&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">He took the first step up, so that the light over the stoop could fall fully on his face, I joined him. Hal</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Moores looked back and forth between us, his angry determination giving way to bewilderment. &#34;What</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">are you doing here?&#34; he asked. &#34;Not only is it the shank of the morning, you boys have the duty. I know</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">you do, I've got the roster pinned up in my workshop. So what in the name of ... oh, Jesus. It's not a</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">lockdown, is it? Or a riot?&#34; He looked between us, and his gaze sharpened. &#34;Who else is down by that</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">truck?&#34;</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="4"><i>Let me do the talking.</i> So I had instructed Brutal, but now the time to talk was here and I couldn't even</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">open my mouth. On my way into work that afternoon I had carefully planned out what I was going to say</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">when we got here, and had thought that it didn't sound too crazy. Not normal - nothing about it was</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">normal - but maybe close enough to normal to get us through the door and give us a chance. Give <i>John</i> a</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">chance. But now all my carefully rehearsed words were lost in a roaring confusion. Thoughts and images</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">- Del burning, the mouse dying, Toot jerking in Old Sparky's lap and screaming that he was a done tom</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">turkey - whirled inside my head like sand caught in a dust-devil. I believe there is good in the world, all</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">of it flowing in one way or another from a loving God. But I believe there's another force as well, one</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">every bit as real as the God I have prayed to my whole life, and that it works consciously to bring all our</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">decent impulses to ruin. Not Satan, I don't mean Satan (although I believe he is real, too), but a kind of</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">demon of discord, a prankish and stupid thing that laughs with glee when an old man sets himself on fire</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">trying to light his pipe or when a much-loved baby puts its first Christmas toy in its mouth and chokes to</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">death on it. I've had a lot of years to think on this, all the way from Cold Mountain to Georgia Pines, and</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">I believe that force was actively at work among us on that morning, swirling everywhere like a fog,</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="471" height="19" font="3">trying to keep John Coffey away from Melinda Moores.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="467" height="19" font="3">&#34;Warden ... Hal ... I ...&#34; Nothing I tried made any sense.</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">He raised the pistol again, pointing it between Brutal and me, not listening. His bloodshot eyes had</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">gotten very wide. And here came Harry Terwilliger, being more or less pulled along by our big boy, who</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="419" height="19" font="3">was wearing his wide and daffily charming smile.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Coffey,&#34; Moores breathed. &#34;John Coffey.&#34; He pulled in breath and yelled in a voice that was reedy but</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="355" height="19" font="3">strong: &#34;Halt! Halt right there, or I shoot!&#34;</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">From somewhere behind him, a weak and wavery female voice called: &#34;Hal? What are you doing out</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">there? Who are you talking to, you fucking cocksucker?&#34;</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">He turned in that direction for just a moment, his face confused and despairing. Just a moment, as I say,</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">but it should have been long enough for me to snatch the long-barrelled gun out of his hand. Except I</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">couldn't lift my own hands. They might have had weights tied to them. My head seemed full of static,</text>
</page>
<page number="162" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">like a radio trying to broadcast during an electrical storm. The only emotions I remember feeling were</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="403" height="19" font="3">fright and a kind of dull embarrassment for Hal.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Harry and John Coffey reached the foot of the steps. Moores turned away from the sound of his wife's</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">voice and raised the gun again. He said later that yes, he fully intended to shoot Coffey; he suspected we</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">were all prisoners, and that the brains behind whatever was happening were back by the truck, lurking in</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">the shadows. He didn't understand why we should have been brought to his house, but revenge seemed</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="223" height="19" font="3">the most likely possibility.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Before he could shoot, Harry Terwilliger stepped up ahead of Coffey and then moved in front of him,</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="687" height="19" font="3">shielding most of his body. Coffey didn't make him do it; Harry did it on his own.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, Warden Moores!&#34; he said. &#34;It's all right! No one's armed, no one's going to get hurt, we're here to</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="52" height="19" font="3">help!&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Help?&#34; Moores's tangled, tufted eyebrows drew together. His eyes blazed. I couldn't take my eyes off</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="516" height="19" font="3">the cocked hammer of the Buntline. &#34;Help what? Help who?&#34;</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">As if in answer, the old woman's voice rose again, querulous and certain and utterly lost: &#34;Come in here</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">and poke my mudhole, you son of a bitch! Bring your asshole friends, too! Let them all have a turn!&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">I looked at Brutal, shaken to my soul. I'd understood that she swore - that the tumor was somehow</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="544" height="19" font="4"><i>making</i> her swear - but this was more than swearing. A lot more.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;What are you doing here?&#34; Moores asked us again. A lot of the determination had gone out of his voice</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="727" height="19" font="3">- his wife's wavering cries had done that. &#34;I don't understand. Is it a prison break, or...&#34;</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">John set Harry aside - just picked him up and moved him over - and then climbed to the stoop. He stood</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="809" height="19" font="3">between Brutal and me, so big he almost pushed us off either side and into Melly's holly bushes.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Moores's eyes turned up to follow him, the way a person's eyes do when he's trying to see the top of a tall</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">tree. And suddenly the world fell back into place for me. That spirit of discord, which had jumbled my</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="793" height="19" font="3">thoughts like powerful fingers sifting through sand or grains of rice, was gone. I thought I also</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">understood why Harry had been able to act when Brutal and I could only stand, hopeless and indecisive,</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">in front of our boss. Harry had been with John... and whatever spirit it is that opposes that other, demonic</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">one, it was in John Coffey that night. And, when John stepped forward to face Warden Moores, it was</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">that other spirit - something white, that's how I think of it, as something white - which took control of the</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">situation. The other thing didn't leave, but I could see it drawing back like a shadow in a sudden strong</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="44" height="19" font="3">light.</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">&#34;I want to help,&#34; John Coffey said. Moores looked up at him, eyes fascinated, mouth hanging open.</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">When Coffey plucked the Buntline Special from his hand and passed it to me, I don't think Hal even</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">knew it was gone. I carefully lowered the hammer. Later, when I checked the cylinder, I would find it</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">had been empty all along. Sometimes I wonder if Hal knew that. Meanwhile, John was still murmuring.</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="426" height="19" font="3">&#34;I came to help her. Just to help. That's all I want.&#34;</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hal!&#34; she cried from the back bedroom. Her voice sounded a little stronger now, but it also sounded</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">afraid, as if the thing which had so confused and unmanned us had now retreated to her. &#34;Make them go</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">away, whoever they are! We don't need no sales men in the middle of the night! No Electrolux! No</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Hoover! No French knickers with come in the crotch! Get them out! Tell them to take a flying fuck at a</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="806" height="19" font="3">rolling d ... d ...&#34; Something broke - it could have been a waterglass - and then she began to sob.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just to help,&#34; John Coffey said in a voice so low it was hardly more than a whisper. He ignored the</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="587" height="19" font="3">woman's sobbing and profanity equally. &#34;Just to help, boss, that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;You can't,&#34; Moores said. &#34;No one can.&#34; It was a tone I'd heard before, and after a moment I realized it</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">was how I'd sounded myself when I'd gone into Coffey's cell the night he cured my urinary infection.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Hypnotized. You <i>mind your business and I'll mind mine</i> was what I'd told Delacroix ... except it had been</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="705" height="19" font="4"><i>Coffey</i> who'd been minding my business, just as he was minding Hal Moores's now.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;We think he can,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;And we didn't risk our jobs - plus a stretch in the can ourselves, maybe -</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="686" height="19" font="3">just to get here and turn around and go back without giving it the old college try.&#34;</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="590" height="19" font="3">Only I had been ready to do just that three minutes before. Brutal, too.</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">John Coffey took the play out of our hands. He pushed into the entry and past Moores, who raised a</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">single strengthless hand to stop him (it trailed across Coffey's hip and fell off; I'm sure the big man never</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">even felt it), and then shuffled down the hall toward the living room, the kitchen beyond it, and the back</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">bedroom beyond that where that shrill unrecognizable voice raised itself again: &#34;You stay out of here!</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Whoever you are, just stay out! I'm not dressed, my tits are out and my bitchbox is taking the breeze!&#34;</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">John paid no attention, just went stolidly along, head bent so he wouldn't smash any of the light fixtures,</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">his round brown skull gleaming, his hands swinging at his sides. After a moment we followed him, me</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">first, Brutal and Hal side by side, and Harry bringing up the rear. I understood one thing perfectly well: it</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="367" height="19" font="3">was all out of our hands now, and in John's.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>8.</b></text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">The woman in the back bedroom, propped up against the headboard and staring wall-eyed at the giant</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">who had come into her muddled sight, didn't look at all like the Melly Moores I had known for twenty</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">years; she didn't even look like the Melly Moores Janice and I had visited shortly before Delacroix's</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">execution. The woman propped up in that bed looked like a sick child got up as a Halloween witch. Her</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">livid skin was a hanging dough of wrinkles. It was puckered up around the eye on the right side, as if she</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">were trying to wink. That same side of her mouth turned down, one old yellow eyetooth hung out over</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">her liverish lower lip. Her hair was a wild thin fog around her skull. The room stank of the stuff our</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">bodies dispose of with such decorum when things are running right. The chamberpot by her bed was half</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">full of some vile yellowish goo. We had come too late anyway, I thought, horrified. It had only been a</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">matter of days since she had been recognizable - sick but still herself Since then, the thing in her head</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">must have moved with horrifying speed to consolidate its position. I didn't think even John Coffey could</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="115" height="19" font="3">help her now.</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="804" height="19" font="3">Her expression when Coffey entered was one of fear and horror - as if something inside her had</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">recognized a doctor that might be able to get at it and pry it loose, after all ... to sprinkle salt on it the way</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">you do on a leech to make it let go its grip. Hear me carefully: I'm not saying that Melly Moores was</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">possessed, and I'm aware that, wrought up as I was, all my perceptions of that night must be suspect. But</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">I have never completely discounted the possibility of demonic possession, either. There was something in</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">her eyes, I tell you, something that looked like fear. On that I think you can trust me; it's an emotion I've</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="241" height="19" font="3">seen too much of to mistake.</text>
</page>
<page number="164" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Whatever it was, it was gone in a hurry, replaced by a look of lively, irrational interest. That unspeakable</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="416" height="19" font="3">mouth trembled in what might have been a smile.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, so big!&#34; she cried. She sounded like a little girl just coming down with a bad throat infection. She</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">took her hands -as spongy-white as her face - out from under the counterpane and patted them together.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="748" height="19" font="3">&#34;Pull down your pants! I've heard about nigger-cocks my whole life but never seen one!&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="537" height="19" font="3">Behind me, Moores made a soft groaning sound, full of despair.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">John Coffey paid no attention to any of it. After standing still for a moment, as if to observe her from a</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">little distance, he crossed to the bed, which was illuminated by a single bedside lamp. It threw a bright</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">circle of light on the white counterpane drawn up to the lace at the throat of her nightgown. Beyond the</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">bed, in shadow, I saw the chaise longue which belonged in the parlor. An afghan Melly had knitted with</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">her own hands in happier days lay half on the chaise and half on the floor. It was here Hal had been</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="391" height="19" font="3">sleeping - dozing, at least - when we pulled in.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">As John approached, her expression underwent a third change. Suddenly I saw Melly, whose kindness</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">had meant so much to me over the years, and even more to Janice when the kids had flown from the nest</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">and she had been left feeling so alone and useless and blue. Melly was still interested, but now her</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="269" height="19" font="3">interest seemed sane and aware.</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who are you?&#34; she asked in a clear, reasonable voice. &#34;And why have you so many scars on your hands</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="301" height="19" font="3">and arms? Who hurt you so badly?&#34;</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't hardly remember where they all come from, ma'am,&#34; John Coffey said in a humble voice, and sat</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="237" height="19" font="3">down beside her on her bed.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Melinda smiled as well as she could - the sneering right side of her mouth trembled, but wouldn't quite</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">come up. She touched a white scar, curved like a scimitar, on the back of his left hand. &#34;What a blessing</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="282" height="19" font="3">that is! Do you understand why?&#34;</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Reckon if you don't know who hurt you or dog you down, it don't keep you up nights,&#34; John Coffey said</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="246" height="19" font="3">in his almost-Southern voice.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">She laughed at that, the sound as pure as silver in the bad-smelling sickroom. Hal was beside me now,</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">breathing rapidly but not trying to interfere. When Melly laughed, his rapid breathing paused for a</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">moment, indrawn, and one of his big hands gripped my shoulder. He gripped it hard enough to leave a</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="496" height="19" font="3">bruise - I saw it the next day - but right then I hardly felt it.</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="270" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's your name?&#34; she asked.</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="191" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey, ma'am.&#34;</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="198" height="19" font="3">&#34;Coffey like the drink.&#34;</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="311" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, ma'am, only spelled different.&#34;</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">She lay back against her pillows, propped up but not quite sitting up, looking at him. He sat beside her,</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">looking back, and the light from the lamp circled them like they were actors on a stage - the hulking</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">black man in the prison overall and the small dying white woman. She stared into John's eyes with</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="164" height="19" font="3">shining fascination.</text>
</page>
<page number="165" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="84" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ma'am?&#34;</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, John Coffey?&#34; The words barely breathed, barely slipping to us on the bad-smelling, air. I felt the</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">muscles bunching on my arms and legs and back. Somewhere, far away, I could feel the warden</text>
<text top="134" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">clutching my arm, and to the side of my vision I could see Harry and Brutal with their arms around each</text>
<text top="158" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">other, like little kids lost in the night. Something was going to happen. Something big. We each felt it in</text>
<text top="182" left="15" width="115" height="19" font="3">our own way.</text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">John Coffey bent closer to her. The springs of the bed creaked, the bedclothes rustled, and the coldly</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">smiling moon looked in through an upper pane of the bedroom window. Coffey's bloodshot eyes</text>
<text top="269" left="15" width="304" height="19" font="3">searched her upturned haggard face.</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;O, I see it,&#34; he said. Speaking not to her - I don't think so, anyway - but to himself. &#34;I see it, and I can</text>
<text top="332" left="15" width="306" height="19" font="3">help. Hold still ... hold right still .. .&#34;</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Closer he bent, and closer still. For a moment his huge face stopped less than two inches from hers. He</text>
<text top="395" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">raised one hand off to the side, fingers splayed, as if telling something to wait ... just wait ... and then he</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">lowered his face again. His broad, smooth lips pressed against hers and forced them open. For a moment</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">I could see one of her eyes, staring up past Coffey, filling with an expression of what seemed to be</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="570" height="19" font="3">surprise. Then his smooth bald head moved, and that was gone, too.</text>
<text top="506" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">There was a soft whistling sound as he inhaled the air which lay deep within her lungs. That was all for a</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">second or two, and then the floor moved under us and the whole house moved around us. It wasn't my</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">imagination; they all felt it, they all remarked on it later. It was a kind of rippling thump. There was a</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">crash as something very heavy fell over in the parlor - the grandfather clock, it turned out to be. Hal</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Moores tried to have it repaired, but it never kept time for more than fifteen minutes at a stretch again.</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Closer by there was a crack followed by a tinkle as the pane of glass through which the moon had been</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">peeking broke. A picture on the wall - a clipper ship cruising one of the seven seas - fell off its hook and</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="447" height="19" font="3">crashed to the floor; the glass over its front shattered.</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">I smelled something hot and saw smoke rising from the bottom of the white counterpane which covered</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">her. A portion was turning black, down by the jittering lump that was her right foot. Feeling like a man in</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">a dream, I shook free of Moores's hand and stepped to the night-table. There was a glass of water there,</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">surrounded by three or four bottles of pills which had fallen over during the shake. I picked up the water</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="534" height="19" font="3">and dumped it on the place that was smoking. There was a hiss.</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">John Coffey went on kissing her in that deep and intimate way, inhaling and inhaling, one hand still held</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">out, the other on the bed, propping up his immense weight. The fingers were splayed; the hand looked to</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="208" height="19" font="3">me like a brown starfish.</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="812" height="19" font="3">Suddenly, her back arched. One of her own hands flailed out in the air, the fingers clenching and</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">unclenching in a series of spasms. Her feet drummed against the bed. Then something screamed. Again,</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">that's not just me; the other men heard it, as well. To Brutal it sounded like a wolf or coyote with its leg</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">caught in a trap. To me it sounded like an eagle, the way you'd sometimes hear them on still mornings</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="666" height="19" font="3">back then, cruising down through the misty cuts with their wings stiffly spread.</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Outside, the wind gusted hard enough to give the house a second shake - and that was strange, you know,</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">because until then there had been no wind to speak of at all.</text>
</page>
<page number="166" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">John Coffey pulled away from her, and I saw that her face had smoothed out. The right side of her mouth</text>
<text top="71" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">no longer drooped. Her eyes had regained their normal shape, and she looked ten years younger. He</text>
<text top="95" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">regarded her raptly for a moment or two, and then he began to cough. He turned his head so as not to</text>
<text top="119" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">cough in her face, lost his balance (which wasn't hard; big as he was, he'd been sitting with his butt</text>
<text top="143" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">halfway off the side of the bed to start with), and went down onto the floor. There was enough of him to</text>
<text top="167" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">give the house a third shake. He landed on his knees and hung his head over, coughing like a man in the</text>
<text top="191" left="15" width="146" height="19" font="3">last stages of TB.</text>
<text top="230" left="15" width="764" height="19" font="3">I thought, Now <i>the bugs. He's going to cough them out, and what a lot there'll be this time.</i></text>
<text top="269" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">But he didn't. He only went on coughing in deep retching barks, hardly finding time between fits to</text>
<text top="293" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">snatch in the next breath of air. His dark, chocolatey skin was graying out. Alarmed, Brutal went to him,</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">dropped to one knee beside him, and put an arm across his broad, spasming back. As if Brutal's moving</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">had broken a spell, Moores went to his wife's bed and sat where Coffey had sat. He hardly seemed to</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">register the coughing, choking giant's presence at all. Although Coffey was kneeling at his very feet,</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">Moores had eyes only for his wife, who was gazing at him with amazement. Looking at her was like</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="449" height="19" font="3">looking at a dirty mirror which has been wiped clean.</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="578" height="19" font="3">&#34;John!&#34; Brutal shouted. &#34;Sick it up! Sick it up like you done before!&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">John went on barking those choked coughs. His eyes were wet, not with tears but with strain. Spit flew</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="486" height="19" font="3">from his mouth in a fine spray, but nothing else came out.</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Brutal whammed him on the back a couple of times, then looked around at me. &#34;He's choking! Whatever</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="3">he sucked out of her, he's choking on it!&#34;</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I started forward. Before I got two steps, John knee-walked away from me and into the corner of the</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">room, still coughing harshly and dragging for each breath. He laid his forehead against the wallpaper -</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">wild red roses overspreading a garden wall - and made a gruesome deep hacking sound, as if he were</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">trying to vomit up the lining of his own throat. That'll bring the bugs if anything can, I remember</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">thinking, but there was no sign of them. All the same, his coughing fit seemed to ease a little.</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm all right, boss,&#34; he said, still leaning with his forehead against the wild roses. His eyes remained</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">closed. I'm not sure how he knew I was there, but he clearly did. &#34;Honest I am. See to the lady.&#34;</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I looked at him doubtfully, then turned to the bed. Hal was stroking Melly's brow, and I saw an amazing</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="706" height="19" font="3">thing above it: some of her hair - not very much, but some - had gone back to black.</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's happened?&#34; she asked him. As I watched, color began to blush into her cheeks. It was as if she</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">had stolen a couple of roses right out of the wallpaper. &#34;How did I get here? We were going to the</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">hospital up in Indianola, weren't we? A doctor was going to shoot X-rays into my head and take pictures</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="112" height="19" font="3">of my brain.&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="497" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shhh,&#34; Hal said. &#34;Shhh, dearie, none of that matters now.&#34;</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;But I don't <i>understand!&#34;</i> she nearly wailed, &#34;We stopped at a roadside stand ... you bought me a dime</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">packet of posies ... and then ... I'm here. It's dark! Have you had your supper, Hal? Why am I in the guest</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">room? Did I have the X-ray?&#34; Her eyes moved across Harry almost without seeing him - that was shock,</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="496" height="19" font="3">I imagine - and fixed on me. &#34;Paul? Did I have the X-ray?&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="167" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="236" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said. &#34;It was clear.&#34;</text>
<text top="77" left="15" width="231" height="19" font="3">&#34;They didn't find a tumor?&#34;</text>
<text top="116" left="15" width="504" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; I said. &#34;They say the headaches will likely stop now.&#34;</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="265" height="19" font="3">Beside her, Hal burst into tears.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">She sat forward and kissed his temple. Then her eyes moved to the comer. &#34;Who is that Negro man?</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="214" height="19" font="3">Why is he in the corner?&#34;</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I turned and saw John trying to get up on his feet. Brutal helped him and John made it with a final lunge.</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">He stood facing the wall, though, like a child who has been bad. He was still coughing in spasms, but</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="301" height="19" font="3">these seemed to be weakening now.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">&#34;John,&#34; I said. &#34;Turn around, big boy, and see this lady.&#34;</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">He slowly turned. His face was still the color of ashes, and he looked ten years older, like a once</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">powerful man at last losing a long battle with consumption. His eyes were cast down on his prison</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="481" height="19" font="3">slippers, and he looked as if he wished for a hat to wring.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="461" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who are you?&#34; she asked again. &#34;What's your name?&#34;</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey, ma'am,&#34; he said, to which she immediately replied, &#34;But not spelled like the drink.&#34;</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Hal started beside her. She felt it, and patted his hand reassuringly without taking her eyes from the black</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="41" height="19" font="3">man.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;I dreamed of you,&#34; she said in a soft, wondering voice. &#34;I dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="269" height="19" font="3">so was I. We found each other.&#34;</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="217" height="19" font="3">John Coffey said nothing.</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="739" height="19" font="3">&#34;We found each other in the dark,&#34; she said. &#34;Stand up, Hal, you're pinning me in here.&#34;</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">He got up and watched with disbelief as she turned back the counterpane. &#34;Melly, you can't-&#34;</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't be silly,&#34; she said, and swung her legs out. &#34;Of course I can.&#34; She smoothed her nightgown,</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="250" height="19" font="3">stretched, then got to her feet.</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="552" height="19" font="3">&#34;My God,&#34; Hal whispered. &#34;My dear God in heaven, look at her.&#34;</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">She went to John Coffey. Brutal stood away from her, an awed expression on his face. She limped with</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">the first step, did no more than favor her right leg a bit with the second, and then even that was gone. I</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">remembered Brutal handing the colored spool to Delacroix and saying, &#34;Toss it - I want to see how he</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">runs.&#34; Mr. Jingles had limped then, but on the next night, the night Del walked the Mile, he had been</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="38" height="19" font="3">fine.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">Melly put her arms around John and hugged him. Coffey stood there for a moment, letting himself be</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">hugged, and then he raised one hand and stroked the top of her head. This he did with infinite gentleness.</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="497" height="19" font="3">His face was still gray. I thought he looked dreadfully sick.</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">She stood away from him, her face turned up to his. &#34;Thank you.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="168" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="216" height="19" font="3">&#34;Right welcome, ma'am.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="597" height="19" font="3">She turned to Hal and walked back to him. He put his arms around her.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul-&#34; It was Harry. He held his right wrist out to me and tapped the face of his watch. It was pressing</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">on to three o'clock. Light would start showing by four-thirty. If we wanted to get Coffey back to Cold</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Mountain before that happened, we would have to go soon. And I wanted to get him back. Partly because</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the longer this went on the worse our chances of getting away with it became, yes, of course. But I also</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">wanted John in a place where I could legitimately call a doctor for him, if the need arose. Looking at</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="196" height="19" font="3">him, I thought it might.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">The Mooreses were sitting on the edge of the bed, arms around each other. I thought of asking Hal out</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">into the living room for a private word, then realized I could ask until the cows came home and he</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">wouldn't budge from where he was right then. He might be able to take his eyes off her - for a few</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="505" height="19" font="3">seconds, at least - by the time the sun came up, but not now.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="300" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hal,&#34; I said. &#34;We have to go now.&#34;</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">He nodded, not looking at me. He was studying the color in his wife's cheeks, the natural unstrained</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="465" height="19" font="3">curve of his wife's lips, the new black in his wife's hair.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="710" height="19" font="3">I tapped him on the shoulder, hard enough to get his attention for a moment, at least.</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="231" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hal, we never came here.&#34;</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="89" height="19" font="3">&#34;What - ?&#34;</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;We never came here,&#34; I said. &#34;Later on we'll talk, but for now that's all you need to know. We were</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="109" height="19" font="3">never here.-&#34;</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, all right He forced himself to focus on me for a moment, with what was clearly an effort. &#34;You got</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="299" height="19" font="3">him out. Can you get him back in?&#34;</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think so. Maybe. But we need to go.&#34;</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;How did you know he could do this?&#34; Then he shook his head, as if realizing for himself that this wasn't</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">the time. &#34;Paul ... thank you.&#34;</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't thank me,&#34; I said. &#34;Thank John.&#34;</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">He looked at John Coffey, then put out one hand - just as I had done on the day Harry and Percy escorted</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="465" height="19" font="3">John onto the block. &#34;Thank you. Thank you so much.&#34;</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">John looked at the hand. Brutal threw a none-too-subtle elbow into his side. John started, then took the</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">hand and gave it a shake. Up, down, back to center, release. &#34;Welcome,&#34; he said in a hoarse voice. It</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">sounded to me like Melly's when she had clapped her hands and told John to pull down his pants.</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Welcome,&#34; he said to the man who would, in the ordinary course of things, grasp a pen with that hand</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="434" height="19" font="3">and then sign John Coffey's execution order with it.</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">Harry tapped the face of his watch, more urgently this time.</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="215" height="19" font="3">&#34;Brute?&#34; I said. &#34;Ready?&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="169" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="44" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hello, Brutus,&#34; Melinda said in a cheerful voice, as if noticing him for the first time. &#34;It's good to see</text>
<text top="68" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">you. Would you gentlemen like tea? Would you, Hal? I could make it.&#34; She got up again. &#34;I've been ill,</text>
<text top="92" left="15" width="400" height="19" font="3">but I feel fine now. Better than I have in years.&#34;</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;Thank you, Missus Moores, but we have to go,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;It's past John's bedtime.&#34; He smiled to</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="586" height="19" font="3">show it was a joke, but the look he gave John was as anxious as I felt.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="186" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well ... if you're sure</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="789" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, ma'am. Come on, John Coffey.&#34; He tugged John's arm to get him going, and John went.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just a minute!&#34; Melinda shook free of Hal's hand and ran as lightly as a girl to where John stood. She</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">put her arms around him and gave him another hug. Then she reached around to the nape of her neck and</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">pulled a fine-link chain out of her bodice. At the end of it was a silver medallion. She held it out to John,</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="314" height="19" font="3">who looked at it uncomprehendingly.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's St. Christopher,&#34; she said. &#34;I want you to have it, Mr. Coffey, and wear it. He'll keep you safe.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="201" height="19" font="3">Please wear it. For me.&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="784" height="19" font="3">John looked at me, troubled, and I looked at Hal, who first spread his hands and then nodded.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="321" height="19" font="3">&#34;Take it, John,&#34; I said. &#34;It's a present.&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">John took it, slipped the chain around his bullneck, and dropped the St. Christopher medallion into the</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">front of his shirt. He had completely stopped coughing now, but I thought he looked grayer and sicker</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="83" height="19" font="3">than ever.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">&#34;Thank you, ma'am,&#34; he said.</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="483" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; she replied. &#34;Thank you. Thank you, John Coffey.&#34;</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>9.</b></text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I rode up in the cab with Harry going back, and was damned glad to be there. The heater was broken, but</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">we were out of the open air, at least. We had gone about ten miles when Harry spotted a little turnout and</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="195" height="19" font="3">veered the truck into it.</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;What is it?&#34; I asked. &#34;Is it a bearing?&#34; To my mind, the problem could have been that or anything; every</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">component of the Farmall's engine and transmission sounded on the verge of going cataclysmically</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="318" height="19" font="3">wrong or giving up the ghost entirely.</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nope,&#34; Harry said, sounding apologetic. &#34;I got to take a leak, is all. My back teeth are floatin.&#34;</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">It turned out that we all did, except for John. When Brutal asked if he wouldn't like to step down and help</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">us water the bushes, he just shook his head without looking up. He was leaning against the back of the</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">cab and wearing one of the Army blankets over his shoulders like a serape. I couldn't get any kind of read</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">on his complexion, but I could hear his breathing - dry and raspy, like wind blowing through straw. I</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="106" height="19" font="3">didn't like it.</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">I walked into a clump of willows, unbuttoned, and let go. I was still dose enough to my urinary infection</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">so that the body's amnesia had not taken full hold, and I could be grateful simply to be able to pee</text>

<page number="170" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">without needing to scream. I stood there, emptying out and looking up at the moon, I was hardly aware of</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Brutal standing next to me and doing the same thing until he said in a low voice, &#34;Hell never sit in Old</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="73" height="19" font="3">Sparky.&#34;</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">I looked around at him, surprised and a little frightened by the low certainty in his tone. &#34;What do you</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="63" height="19" font="3">mean?&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;I mean he swallered that stuff instead of spitting out like he done before for a reason. It might take a</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">week-he's awful big and strong - but I bet it's quicker. One of us'll do a check-tour and there he'll be,</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="277" height="19" font="3">lying dead as stone on his bunk.&#34;</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I'd thought I was done peeing, but at that a little shiver twisted up my back and a little more squirted out.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">As I rebuttoned my fly, I thought that what Brutal was saying made perfect sense. And I hoped, all in all,</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">that he was right. John Coffey didn't deserve to die at all, if I was right in my reasoning about the</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Detterick girls, but if he <i>did</i> die, I didn't want it to be by my hand. I wasn't sure I could lift my hand to do</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="165" height="19" font="3">it, if it came to that.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="683" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on,&#34; Harry murmured out of the dark. &#34;It's gettin late. Let's get this done.&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">As we walked back to the truck, I realized we had left John entirely alone - stupidity on the Percy</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Wetmore level. I thought that he would be gone; that he'd spat out the bugs as soon as he saw he was</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">unguarded, and had then just lit out for the territories, like Huck and Jim on the Big Muddy. All we</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="590" height="19" font="3">would find was the blanket he had been wearing around his shoulders.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">But he was there, still sitting with his back against the cab and his forearms propped on his knees. He</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">looked up at the sound of our approach and tried to give us a smile. It hung there for a moment on his</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="286" height="19" font="3">haggard face and then slipped off.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;How you doing, Big John?&#34; Brutal asked, climbing into the back of the truck again and retrieving his</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="108" height="19" font="3">own blanket.</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="360" height="19" font="3">&#34;Fine, boss,&#34; John said listlessly. &#34;I's fine.&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Brutal patted his knee. &#34;We'll be back soon. And when we get squared away, you know what? I'm going</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="561" height="19" font="3">to see you get a great big cup of hot coffee. Sugar and cream, too.&#34;</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">You bet, I thought, going around to the passenger side of the cab and climbing in. If we don't get arrested</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="278" height="19" font="3">and thrown in jail ourselves first.</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">But I'd been living with that idea ever since we'd thrown Percy into the restraint room, and it didn't worry</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">me enough to keep me awake. I dozed off and dreamed of Calvary Hill. Thunder in the west and a smell</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">that might have been juniper berries. Brutal and Harry and Dean and I were standing around in robes and</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">tin hats like in a Cecil B. DeMille movie. We were Centurions, I guess. There were three crosses, Percy</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Wetmore and Eduard Delacroix flanking John Coffey. I looked down at my hand and saw I was holding</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="152" height="19" font="3">a bloody hammer.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="706" height="19" font="4"><i>We got to get him down from there,</i> Paul! Brutal screamed. <i>We got to get him down!</i></text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Except we couldn't, they'd taken away the stepladder. I started to tell Brutal this, and then an extra-hard</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">bounce of the truck woke me up. We were backing into the place where Harry had hidden the truck</text>
</page>
<page number="171" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="642" height="19" font="3">earlier on a day that already seemed to stretch back to the beginning of time.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">The two of us got out and went around to the back. Brutal hopped down all right, but John Coffey's knees</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">buckled and he almost fell. It took all three of us to catch him, and he was no more than set solid on his</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">feet again before he went off into another of those coughing fits, this one the worst yet. He bent over, the</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">coughing sounds muffled by the heels of his palms, which he held pressed against his mouth.</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">When his coughing eased, we covered the front of the Farmall with the pine boughs again and walked</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">back the way we had come. The worst part of that whole surreal furlough was - for me, at least - the last</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">two hundred yards, with us scurrying back south along the shoulder of the highway. I could see (or</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">thought I could) the first faint lightening of the sky in the east, and felt sure some early farmer, out to</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">harvest his pumpkins or dig his last few rows of yams, would come along and see us. And even if that</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">didn't happen, we would hear someone (in my imagination it sounded like Curtis Anderson) shout</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;<i>Holdit right there!&#34;</i> as I used the Aladdin key to unlock the enclosure around the bulkhead leading to the</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">tunnel. Then two dozen carbine-toting guards would step out of <i>the woods</i> and our little adventure would</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="68" height="19" font="3">be over.</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">By the time we actually got to the enclosure, my heart was whamming so hard that I could see little white</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">dots exploding in front of my eyes with each pulse it made. My hands felt cold and numb and faraway,</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="544" height="19" font="3">and for the longest time I couldn't get the key to go into the lock.</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh Christ, headlights!&#34; Harry moaned.</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">I looked up and saw brightening fans of light on the road. My keyring almost fell out of my hand; I</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="325" height="19" font="3">managed to clutch it at the last second.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="358" height="19" font="3">&#34;Give them to me,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;I'll do it.&#34;</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, I've got it,&#34; I said. The key at last slipped into its slot and turned. A moment later we were in. We</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">crouched behind the bulkhead and watched as a Sunshine Bread truck went pottering past the prison.</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">Beside me I could hear John Coffey's tortured breathing. He sounded like an engine which has almost run</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">out of oil. He had held the bulkhead door up effortlessly for us on our way out, but we didn't even ask</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">him to help this time; it would have been out of the question. Brutal and I got the door up, and Harry led</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">john down the steps. The big man tottered as he went, but he got down. Brutal and I followed him as fast</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="588" height="19" font="3">as we could, then lowered the bulkhead behind us and locked it again.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="779" height="19" font="3">&#34;Christ, I think we're gonna - &#34; Brutal began, but I cut him off with a sharp elbow to the ribs.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="615" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't say it,&#34; I said. &#34;Don't even think it, until he's safe back in his cell.&#34;</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;And there's Percy to think about,&#34; Harry said. Our voices had a flat, echoey quality in the brick tunnel.</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="541" height="19" font="3">&#34;The evening ain't over as long as we got him to contend with.-&#34;</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="402" height="19" font="3">As it turned out, our evening was far from over.</text>

<text top="302" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">effort to save her life. I wrote about the drugging of William Wharton, who fancied himself the second</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">coming of Billy the Kid; I wrote of how we stuck Percy in the straitjacket and jugged him in the restraint</text>

<text top="374" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">exhilarating - and the miracle that befell at the end of it. We saw John Coffey drag a woman back, not</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="732" height="19" font="3">just from the edge of her grave, but from what seemed to us to be the very bottom of it.</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">I wrote and was very faintly aware of the Georgia Pines version of life going on around me. Old folks</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">went down to supper, then trooped off to the Resource Center (yes, you are permitted a chuckle) for their</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">evening dose of network sitcoms. I seem to remember my friend Elaine bringing me a sandwich, and</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">thanking her, and eating it, but I couldn't tell you what time of the evening she brought it, or what was in</text>

<text top="692" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">think of Melinda again, and what she had said to John after the miracle had happened. I <i>dreamed of you.</i></text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="665" height="19" font="4"><i>I dreamed you were wandering in the dark, and so was I. We found each other.</i></text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Georgia Pines grew quiet, midnight came and passed, and still I wrote. I got to Harry reminding us that,</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">even though we had gotten John back to the prison without being discovered, we still had Percy waiting</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">for us. &#34;The evening ain't over as long as we got him to contend with&#34; is more or less what Harry said.</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">That's where my long day of driving my father's pen at last caught up with me. I put it down - just for a</text>

<text top="890" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">on my arm and closed my eyes to rest them. When I opened them again and raised my head, morning sun</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">glared in at me through the windows. I looked at my watch and saw it was past eight. I had slept, head on</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">arms like an old drunk, for what must have been six hours. I got up, wincing, trying to stretch some life</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">into my back. I thought about going down to the kitchen, getting some toast, and going for my morning</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">walk, then looked down at the sheafs of scribbled pages scattered across the desk. All at once I decided</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">to put off the walk for awhile. I had a chore, yes, but it could keep, and I didn't feel like playing</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="775" height="19" font="3">about that morning is how desperately I wanted to get free of John Coffey's persistent ghost.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="368" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay,&#34; I said. &#34;One more mile. But first...&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">I walked down to the toilet at the end of the second floor hall. As I stood inside there, urinating, I</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">happened to glance up at the smoke detector on the ceiling. That made me think of Elaine, and how she</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">had distracted Dolan so I could go for my walk and do my little chore the day before. I finished peeing</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="195" height="19" font="3">with a grin on my face.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">I walked back to the sunroom, feeling better (and a lot comfier in my nether regions). Someone - Elaine,</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">I have no doubt - had set down a pot of tea beside my pages. I drank greedily, first one cup, then another,</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">before I even sat down. Then I resumed my place, uncapped the fountain pen, and once more began to</text>

<text top="335" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I was just slipping fully into my story when a shadow fell on me. I looked up and felt a sinking in MY</text>

<text top="398" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Missed you going on your morning walk, Paulie, he said, &#34;so I thought I'd come and see what you were</text>

<text top="461" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're all heart and a mile wide,&#34; I said. My voice sounded all right - so far, anyway - but my heart was</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">pounding hard. I was afraid of him, and I don't think that realization was entirely new. He reminded me</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">of Percy Wetmore, and I'd never been afraid of him ... but when I knew Percy, I had been young.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="429" height="19" font="3">Brad's smile widened, but became no less pleasant.</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Folks tellin me you been in here all night, Paulie, just writing your little report. Now, that's just no good.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="347" height="19" font="3">Old farts like you need their beauty rest.&#34;</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy - &#34; I began, then saw a frown crease his grin and realized my mistake. I took a deep breath and</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="439" height="19" font="3">began again. &#34;Brad, what have you got against me?&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">He looked puzzled for a moment, maybe a bit unsettled. Then the grin returned. &#34;Old-timer,&#34; he said,</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="714" height="19" font="3">&#34;could be I just don't like your face. What you writin, anyway? Last will n testicles?&#34;</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">He came forward, craning. I slapped my hand over the page I'd been working on. The rest of them I</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">began to rake together with my free hand, crumpling some in my hurry to get them under my arm and</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="105" height="19" font="3">under cover.</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Now,&#34; he said, as if speaking to a baby, &#34;that ain't going to work, you old sweetheart. If Brad wants to</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="638" height="19" font="3">look, Brad is going to look. And you can take that to the everfucking <i>bank.</i>&#34;</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">His hand, young and hideously strong, closed over my wrist, and squeezed. Pain sank into my hand like</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="172" height="19" font="3">teeth, and I groaned.</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="175" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let go,&#34; I managed.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;When you let me see,&#34; he replied, and he was no longer smiling. His face was cheerful, though; the kind</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">of good cheer you only see on the faces of folks who enjoy being mean. &#34;Let me see, Paulie. I want to</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">know what you're writing.&#34; My hand began to move away from the top page. From our trip with John</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">back through the tunnel under the road. &#34;I want to see if it has anything to do with where you-''</text>

<page number="174" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="179" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let that man alone.&#34;</text>
<text top="77" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">The voice was like a harsh whipcrack on a dry, hot day ... and the way Brad Dolan jumped, you would</text>
<text top="101" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">have thought his ass had been the target. He let go of my hand, which thumped back down on my</text>
<text top="125" left="15" width="409" height="19" font="3">paperwork, and we both looked toward the door.</text>
<text top="164" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Elaine Connelly was standing there, looking fresh and stronger than she had in days. She wore jeans that</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">showed off her slim hips and long legs; there was a blue ribbon in her hair. She had a tray in her arthritic</text>
<text top="212" left="15" width="628" height="19" font="3">hands - juice, a scrambled egg, toast, more tea. And her eyes were blazing.</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="591" height="19" font="3">&#34;What do you think you're doing?&#34; Brad asked. &#34;He can't eat up here.&#34;</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;He can, and he's going to,&#34; she said in that same dry tone of command. I had never heard it before, but I</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">welcomed it now. I looked for fear in her eyes and saw not a speck - only rage. &#34;And what you're going</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">to do is get out of here before you go beyond the cockroach level of nuisance to that of slightly larger</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="340" height="19" font="3">vermin - Rattus <i>Americanus, let</i> us say!&#34;</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">He took a step toward her, looking both unsure of himself and absolutely furious. I thought it a dangerous</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">combination, but Elaine didn't flinch as he approached. &#34;I bet I know who set off that goddam smoke</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">alarm,&#34; Dolan said. &#34;Might could have been a certain old bitch with claws for hands. Now get out of</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="471" height="19" font="3">here. Me and Paulie haven't finished our little talk, yet!&#34;</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">&#34;His name is <i>Mr. Edgecombe,&#34;</i> she said, &#34;and if I ever hear you call him Paulie again, I think I can</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="732" height="19" font="3">promise you that your days of employment here at Georgia Pines will end, Mr. Dolan.&#34;</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just who do you think you are?&#34; he asked her. He was hulking over her, now, trying to laugh and not</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="132" height="19" font="3">quite making it.</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think,&#34; she said calmly, &#34;that I am the grandmother of the man who is currently Speaker of the Georgia</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">House of Representatives. A man who loves his relatives, Mr. Dolan. Especially his <i>older</i> relatives.&#34;</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">The effortful smile dropped off his face the way that writing comes off a blackboard swiped with a wet</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">sponge. I saw uncertainty, the possibility that he was being bluffed, the fear that he was not, and a certain</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">dawning logical assumption: it would be easy enough to check, she must know that, ergo she was telling</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">the truth.</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Suddenly I began to laugh, and although the sound was rusty, it was right. I was remembering how many</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">times Percy Wetmore had threatened us with his connections, back in the bad old days. Now, for the first</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">time in my long, long life, such a threat was being made again ... but this time it was being made on my</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="58" height="19" font="3">behalf.</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="493" height="19" font="3">Brad Dolan looked at me, glaring, then looked back at her.</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;I mean it,&#34; Elaine said. &#34;At first I thought I'd just let you be - I'm old, and that seemed easiest. But when</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">my friends are threatened and abused, I <i>do not</i> just let be. Now get out of here. And without one more</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="57" height="19" font="3">word.&#34;</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">His lips moved like those of a fish - oh, how badly he wanted to say that one more word (perhaps the one</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">that rhymes with <i>witch).</i> He didn't, though. He gave me a final look, and then strode past her and out into</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="68" height="19" font="3">the hall.</text>
</page>
<page number="175" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I let out my breath in a long, ragged sigh as Elaine set the tray down in front of me and then set herself</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="669" height="19" font="3">down across from me. &#34;Is your grandson really Speaker of the House?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="119" height="19" font="3">&#34;He really is.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="278" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then what are you doing here?&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">&#34;Speaker of the statehouse makes him powerful enough to deal with a roach like Brad Dolan, but it</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="735" height="19" font="3">doesn't make him <i>rich,&#34;</i> she said, laughing. &#34;Besides, I like it here. I like the company.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="429" height="19" font="3">&#34;I will take that as a compliment,&#34; I said, and I did.</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul, are you all right? You look so tired.&#34; She reached across the table and brushed my hair away from</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">my forehead and eyebrows. Her fingers were twisted, but her touch was cool and wonderful. I closed my</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="591" height="19" font="3">eyes for a moment. When I opened them again, I had made a decision.</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm all right,&#34; I said. &#34;And almost finished. Elaine, would you read something?&#34; I offered her the pages I</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">had clumsily swept together. They were probably no longer in the right order - Dolan really had scared</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="617" height="19" font="3">me badly - but they were numbered and she could quickly put them right.</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="797" height="19" font="3">She looked at me consideringly, not taking what I was offering. Yet, anyway. &#34;Are you done?&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="802" height="19" font="3">&#34;It'll take you until afternoon to read what's there,&#34; I said. &#34;If you can make it out at all, that is.&#34;</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Now she <i>did</i> take the pages, and looked down at them. &#34;You write with a very fine hand, even when that</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="547" height="19" font="3">hand is obviously tired,&#34; she said. &#34;I'll have no trouble with this.&#34;</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;By the time you finish reading, I will have finished writing,&#34; I said. &#34;You can read the rest in a half an</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="669" height="19" font="3">hour or so. And then ... if you're still willing ... I'd like to show you something.&#34;</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="529" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is it to do with where you go most mornings and afternoons?&#34;</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">I nodded.</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">She sat thinking about it for what seemed a long time, then nodded herself and got up with the pages in</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">her hand. &#34;I'll go out back,&#34; she said. &#34;The sun is very warm this morning.&#34;</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="608" height="19" font="3">&#34;And the dragon's been vanquished,&#34; I said. &#34;This time by the lady fair.&#34;</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">She smiled, bent, and kissed me over the eyebrow in the sensitive place that always makes me shiver.</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;We'll hope so,&#34; she said, &#34;but in my experience, dragons like Brad Dolan are hard to get rid of.&#34; She</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">hesitated. &#34;Good luck, Paul. I hope you can vanquish whatever it is that has been festering in you.&#34;</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;I hope so, too,&#34; I said, and thought of John Coffey. I <i>couldn't help it, John</i> had said. I <i>tried, but it was</i></text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="69" height="19" font="4"><i>too late.</i></text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">I ate the eggs she'd brought, drank the juice, and pushed the toast aside for later. Then I picked up my pen</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="552" height="19" font="3">and began to write again, for what I hoped would be the last time.</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="117" height="19" font="3">One last mile.</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="108" height="19" font="3">A green one.</text>

<text top="74" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">When we brought John back to E Block that night, the gurney was a necessity instead of a luxury. I very</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">much doubt if he could have made it the length of the tunnel on his own; it takes more energy to walk at</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">a crouch than it does upright, and it was a damned low ceiling for the likes of John Coffey. I didn't like to</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="247" height="19" font="3">think of him collapsing down</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">there. How would we explain that, on top of trying to explain why we had dressed Percy in the madman's</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="428" height="19" font="3">dinner-jacket and tossed him in the restraint room?</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">But we had the gurney - thank God - and John Coffey lay on it like a beached whale as we pushed him</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">back to the storage-room stairs. He got down off it, staggered, then simply stood with his head lowered,</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">breathing harshly. His skin was so gray he looked as if he'd been rolled in flour. I thought he'd be in the</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="479" height="19" font="3">infirmary by noon ... if he wasn't dead by noon, that was.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">Brutal gave me a grim, desperate look. I gave it right back. &#34;We can't carry him up, but we can help</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="485" height="19" font="3">him,&#34; I said. &#34;You under his right arm, me under his left.&#34;</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="267" height="19" font="3">&#34;What about me?&#34; Harry asked.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="694" height="19" font="3">&#34;Walk behind us. If he looks like going over backward, shove him forward again.&#34;</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;And if that don't work, kinda crouch down where you think he's gonna land and soften the blow,&#34; Brutal</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="39" height="19" font="3">said.</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">&#34;Gosh,&#34; Harry said thinly, &#34;you oughta go on the Orpheum Circuit, Brute, that's how funny you are.&#34;</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="428" height="19" font="3">&#34;I got a sense of humor, all right,&#34; Brutal admitted.</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">In the end, we did manage to get John up the stairs. My biggest worry was that he might faint, but he</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="775" height="19" font="3">didn't. &#34;Go around me and check to make sure the storage room's empty,&#34; I gasped to Harry.</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;What should I say if it's not?&#34; Harry asked, squeezing under my arm. &#34;Avon calling,, and then pop back</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="76" height="19" font="3">in here?&#34;</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="327" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't be a Wisenheimer,&#34; Brutal said.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Harry eased the door open a little way and poked his head through. It seemed to me that he stayed that</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">way for a very long time. At last he pulled back, looking almost cheerful. &#34;Coast's clear. And it's quiet.&#34;</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="688" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let's hope it stays that way,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Come on, John Coffey, almost home.&#34;</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">He was able to cross the storage room under his own power, but we had to help him up the three steps to</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">my office and then almost push him through the little door. When he got to his feet again, he was</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">breathing stertorously, and his eyes had a glassy sheen. Also - I noticed this with real horror - the right</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">side of his mouth had pulled down, making it look like Melinda's had, when we walked into her room</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="331" height="19" font="3">and saw her propped up on her pillows.</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Dean heard us and came in from the desk at the head of the Green Mile. &#34;Thank God! I thought you were</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">never coming back, I'd half made up my mind you were caught, or the Warden plugged you, or-&#34; He</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">broke off, really seeing John for the first time. &#34;Holy cats, what's wrong with him? He looks like he's</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="681" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's not dying ... are you, John ?&#34; Brutal said. His eyes flashed Dean a warning.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="785" height="19" font="3">&#34;Course not, I didn't mean actually dyin&#34; - Dean gave a nervous little laugh - &#34;but, jeepers . .&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="472" height="19" font="3">&#34;Never mind,&#34; I said. &#34;Help us get him back to his cell.&#34;</text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Once again we were foothills surrounding a mountain, but now it was a mountain that had suffered a few</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">million years, worth of erosion, one that was blunted and sad. John Coffey moved slowly, breathing</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="680" height="19" font="3">through his mouth like an old man who smoked too much, but at least he moved.</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="552" height="19" font="3">&#34;What about Percy?&#34; I asked. &#34;Has he been kicking up a ruckus?&#34;</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">&#34;Some at the start,&#34; Dean said. &#34;Trying to yell through the tape you put over his mouth. Cursing, I</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="74" height="19" font="3">believe.&#34;</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="614" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mercy me,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;A good thing our tender ears were elsewhere.&#34;</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Since then, just a mulekick at the door every once in awhile, you know.&#34; Dean was so relieved to see us</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">that he was babbling. His glasses slipped down to the end of his nose, which was shiny with sweat, and</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">he pushed them back up. We passed Wharton's cell. That worthless young man was flat on his back,</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="546" height="19" font="3">snoring like a sousaphone. His eyes were shut this time, all right.</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="295" height="19" font="3">Dean saw me looking and laughed.</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;No trouble from that guy! Hasn't moved since he laid back down on his bunk. Dead to the world. As for</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Percy kicking the door every now and then, I never minded that a bit. Was glad of it, tell you the truth. If</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">he didn't make any noise at all, I'd start wonderin if he hadn't choked to death on that gag you slapped</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">over his cakehole. But that's not the best. You know the best? It's been as quiet as Ash Wednesday</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">morning in New Orleans! Nobody's been down all night!&#34; He said this last in a triumphant, gloating</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="374" height="19" font="3">voice. &#34;We got away with it, boys! We did!&#34;</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">That made him think of why we'd gone through the whole comedy in the first place, and he asked about</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="75" height="19" font="3">Melinda.</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;She's fine,&#34; I said. We had reached John 's cell. What Dean had said was just starting to sink in: We <i>got</i></text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="239" height="19" font="4"><i>away with it, boys ... we did.</i></text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">&#34;Was it like ... you know ... the mouse?&#34; Dear asked. He glanced briefly at the empty cell when</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">Delacroix had lived with Mr. Jingles, then down a the restraint room, which had been the mouse's</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">seeming point of origin. His voice dropped, the way people's voices do when they enter a big church</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">where even the silence seems to whisper. &#34;Was it a...&#34; He gulped. &#34;Shoot, you know what I mean - was it</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="95" height="19" font="3">a miracle?&#34;</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">The three of us looked at each other briefly, confirming what we already knew. &#34;Brought her back from</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="657" height="19" font="3">her damn grave is what he did,&#34; Harry said. &#34;Yeah, it was a miracle, all right.&#34;</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Brutal opened the double locks on the cell, and gave John a gentle push inside. &#34;Go on, now, big boy.</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="481" height="19" font="3">Rest awhile. You earned it. We'll just settle Percy's hash&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="469" height="19" font="3">&#34;He's a bad man,&#34; John said in a low, mechanical voice.</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right, no doubt, wicked as a warlock,&#34; Brutal agreed in his most soothing voice, &#34;but don't you</text>

<page number="178" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">worry a smidge about him, we're not going to let him near you. You just ease down on that bunk of yours</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="785" height="19" font="3">and I'll have that cup of coffee to you in no time. Hot and strong. You'll feel like a new man.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">John sat heavily on his bunk. I thought he'd fall back on it and roll to the wall as he usually did, but he</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">just sat there for the time being, hands clasped loosely between his knees, head lowered, breathing hard</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">through his mouth. The St. Christopher's medal Melinda had given him had fallen out of the top of his</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">shirt and swung back and forth in the air. He'll keep you safe, that's what she'd told him, but John Coffey</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">didn't look a bit safe. He looked like he had taken Melinda's place on the lip of that grave Harry had</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="87" height="19" font="3">spoken of.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">But I couldn't think about John Coffey just then I turned around to the others. &#34;Dean, get Percy's pistol</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="158" height="19" font="3">and hickory stick.&#34;</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay.&#34; He went back up to the desk, unlocked the drawer with the gun and the stick in it, and brought</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="92" height="19" font="3">them back.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ready?&#34; I asked them. My men - good men, and was never prouder of them than I was that night,</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">nodded. Harry and Dean both looked nervous; Brutal as stolid as ever. &#34;Okay. I'm going to do the</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">talking. The less the rest of you open your mouths, the better it'll probably be and the quicker it'll</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">probably wrap up ... for better or worse. Okay?&#34;</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="775" height="19" font="3">They nodded again. I took a deep breath and walked down to the Green Mile restraint room.</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Percy looked up, squinting, when the light fell on him. He was sitting on the floor and licking at the tape</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">I had slapped across his mouth. The part I'd wound around to the back of his head had come free</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">(probably the sweat and brilliantine in his hair had loosened it), and he'd gotten a ways toward getting the</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="775" height="19" font="3">rest off, as well. Another hour and he would've been bawling for help at the top of his lungs.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">He used his feet to shove himself a little way backward when we came in, then stopped, no doubt</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="692" height="19" font="3">realizing that there was nowhere to go except for the southeast corner of the room.</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">I took his gun and stick from Dean and held them out in Percy's direction. &#34;Want these back?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="391" height="19" font="3">He looked at me warily, then nodded his head.</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="380" height="19" font="3">&#34;Brutal,&#34; I said. &#34;Harry. Get him on his feet.&#34;</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">They bent, hooked him under the canvas arms of the straitjacket, and up he came. I moved toward him</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">until we were almost nose to nose. I could smell the sour sweat in which he'd been basting. Some of it</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">probably came from his efforts to get free of the quiet-down coat, or to administer the occasional kicks to</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">the door Dean had heard, but I thought most of his sweat had come as a result of plain old fear: fear of</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="391" height="19" font="3">what we might do to him when we came back.</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">I'll be okay, they ain't <i>killers,</i> Percy would think... and then, maybe, he'd think of Old Sparky and it</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">would cross his mind that yes, in a way we <i>were</i> killers. I'd done seventy-seven myself, more than any of</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">the men I'd ever put the chest-strap on, more than Sergeant York himself got credit for in World War I.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Killing Percy wouldn't be logical, but we'd already behaved illogically, he would have told himself as he</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">sat there with his arms behind him, working with his tongue to get the tape off his mouth. And besides,</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">logic most likely doesn't have much power over a person's thoughts when that person is sitting on the</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="790" height="19" font="3">floor of a room with soft walls, wrapped up as neat and tight as any spider ever wrapped a fly.</text>
</page>
<page number="179" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="41" left="15" width="609" height="19" font="3">Which is to say, if I didn't have him where I wanted now, I never would.</text>
<text top="80" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll take the tape off your mouth if you promise not to start yowling,&#34; I said. &#34;I want to have a talk with</text>
<text top="104" left="15" width="571" height="19" font="3">you, not a shouting match. So what do you say? Will you be quiet?&#34;</text>
<text top="143" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">I saw relief come up in his eyes as he realized that, if I wanted to talk, he really did stand a good chance</text>
<text top="167" left="15" width="507" height="19" font="3">of getting out of this with a whole skin. He nodded his head.</text>
<text top="206" left="15" width="725" height="19" font="3">&#34;If you start noising off, the tape goes back on,&#34; I said. &#34;Do you understand that, too?&#34;</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">Another nod, rather impatient this time.</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I reached up, grabbed the end of the runner he'd worked loose, and gave it a hard yank. It made a loud</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">peeling sound. Brutal winced. Percy yipped with pain and began rubbing his lips. He tried to speak,</text>
<text top="332" left="15" width="577" height="19" font="3">realized he couldn't do it with a hand over his mouth, and lowered it.</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="423" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get me out of this nut-coat, you lugoon,&#34; he spat.</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="175" height="19" font="3">&#34;In a minute,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="187" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Now! Now! Right n-&#34;</i></text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">I slapped his face. It was done before I'd even known I was going to do it ... but of course I'd known it</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">might come to that. Even back during the first talk about Percy that I'd had with Warden Moores, the one</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">where Hal advised me to put Percy out for the Delacroix execution, I'd known it <i>might </i>come to that. A</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">man's hand is like an animal that's only half-tame; mostly it's good, but sometimes it escapes and bites</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="176" height="19" font="3">the first thing it sees.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">The sound was a sharp <i>snap,</i> like a breaking branch. Dean gasped. Percy stared at me in utter shock, his</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">eyes so wide they looked as if they must fall out of their sockets. His mouth opened and closed, opened</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="473" height="19" font="3">and closed, like the mouth of a fish in an aquarium tank.</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;Shut up and listen to me,&#34; I said. &#34;You deserved to be punished for what you did to Del, and we gave</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">you what you deserved. This was the only way we could do it. We all agreed, except for Dean, and he'll</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="685" height="19" font="3">go along with us, because we'll make him sorry if he doesn't. Isn't that so, Dean?&#34;</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; Dean whispered. He was milk-pale. &#34;Guess it is.&#34;</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="408" height="19" font="3">&#34;And we'll make you sorry you were ever born,&#34;</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="776" height="19" font="3">I went on. &#34;We'll see that people know about how you sabotaged the Delacroix execution - &#34;</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="120" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Sabotaged-!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;how you almost got Dean killed. We'll blab enough to keep you out of almost any job your uncle can get</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="45" height="19" font="3">you.&#34;</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Percy was shaking his head furiously. He didn't believe that, perhaps <i>couldn't</i> believe that. My handprint</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="453" height="19" font="3">stood out on his pale cheek like a fortune-teller's sign.</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="806" height="19" font="3">&#34;And no matter what, we'd see you beaten within an inch of your life. We wouldn't have to do it</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">ourselves. We know people, too, Percy, are you so foolish you don't realize that? They aren't up in the</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">state capital, but they still know how to legislate certain matters. These are people who have friends in</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">here, people who have brothers in here, people who have fathers in here. They'd be happy to amputate</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">the nose or the penis of a shitheels like you. They'd do it just so someone they care for could get an extra</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="370" height="19" font="3">three hours in the exercise yard each week.&#34;</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Percy had stopped shaking his head. Now he was only staring. Tears stood in his eyes, but didn't fall. I</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="659" height="19" font="3">think they were tears of rage and frustration. Or maybe I just hoped they were.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Okay - now look on the sunny side, Percy. Your lips sting a little from having the tape pulled off them, I</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">imagine, but otherwise there's nothing hurt but your pride ... and nobody needs to know about that but the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="566" height="19" font="3">people in this room right now. And we'll never tell, will we, boys?&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">They shook their heads. &#34;Course not,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Green Mile business stays on the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="111" height="19" font="3">Always has.&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're going on to Briar Ridge and we're going to leave you alone until you go,&#34; I said. &#34;Do you want to</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="3">leave it at that, Percy, or do you want to play hardball with us?&#34;</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="405" height="19" font="3">There was a long, long silence as he considered.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">I could almost see the wheels turning in his head as he tried out and rejected possible counters. And at</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">last, I think a more basic truth must have overwhelmed the rest of his calculations: the tape was off his</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="770" height="19" font="3">mouth, but he was still wearing the straitjacket and probably he had to piss like a racehorse.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; he said. &#34;We'll consider the matter closed. Now get me out of this coat. It feels like my</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="137" height="19" font="3">shoulders are - &#34;</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">Brutal stepped forward, shouldering me aside, and grabbed Percy's face with one big hand - fingers</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="594" height="19" font="3">denting in Percy's right cheek, thumb making a deep dimple in his left.</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;In a few seconds,&#34; he said. &#34;First, you listen to me. Paul here is the big boss, and so he has to talk</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="170" height="19" font="3">elegant sometimes.&#34;</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">I tried to remember anything elegant I might've said to Percy and couldn't come up with much. Still, I</text>
<text top="761" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">thought it might be best to keep my mouth shut; Percy looked suitably terrorized, and I didn't want to</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="130" height="19" font="3">spoil the effect.</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;People don't always understand that being elegant isn't the same as being soft, and that's where I come</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">in. I don't worry about being elegant. I just say things straight out. So here it is, straight out: if you go</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">back on your promise, we'll most likely take an ass-fucking. But then we'll find you - if we have to go all</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">the way to Russia, we'll find you - and we will fuck you, not just up the ass but in every hole you own.</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">We'll fuck you until you'll wish you were dead, and then we'll rub vinegar in the parts that are bleeding.</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="209" height="19" font="3">Do you understand me?&#34;</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">He nodded. With Brutal's hand digging into the soft sides of his face the way it was, Percy looked eerily</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="165" height="19" font="3">like Old Toot-Toot.</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Brutal let go of him and stepped back. I nodded to Harry, who went behind Percy and started unsnapping</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="135" height="19" font="3">and unbuckling.</text>
<text top="1109" left="15" width="707" height="19" font="3">&#34;Keep it in mind, Percy,&#34; Harry said. &#34;Keep it in mind and let bygones be bygones.&#34;</text>

<text top="47" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">All of it suitably scary, three bogeymen in bluesuits - but I felt a kind of knowing despair sweep through</text>
<text top="71" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">me, all the same. He might keep quiet for a day or a week, continuing to calculate the odds on various</text>
<text top="95" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">actions, but in the end two things - his belief in his connections and his inability to walk away from a</text>
<text top="119" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">situation where he saw himself as the loser would combine. When that happened, he would spill his guts.</text>
<text top="143" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">We had perhaps helped to save Melly Moores's life by taking John to her, and I wouldn't have changed</text>
<text top="167" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">that (&#34;not for all the tea in China,&#34; as we used to say back in those days), but in the end we were going to</text>
<text top="191" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">hit the canvas and the ref was going to count us out. Short of murder, there was no way we could make</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Percy keep his end of the bargain, not once he was away from us and had started to get back what passed</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="100" height="19" font="3">for his guts.</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">I took a little sidelong glance at Brutal and saw he knew this, too. Which didn't surprise me. There were</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">no flies on Mrs. Howell's boy Brutus, never had been. He gave me a tiny shrug, just one shoulder lifting</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">an inch and then dropping, but it was enough. So <i>what?</i> that shrug said. <i>What else is there, Paul? We did</i></text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="429" height="19" font="4"><i>what we had to do, and we did it the best we could.</i></text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="3">Yes. Results hadn't been half-bad, either.</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Harry undid the last buckle on the straitjacket. Grimacing with disgust and rage, Percy pawed it off and</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="539" height="19" font="3">let it drop at his feet. He wouldn't look at any of us, not directly.</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Give me my gun and my baton,&#34; he said. I handed them over. He dropped the gun into its holster and</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="382" height="19" font="3">shoved the hickory stick into its custom loop.</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="260" height="19" font="3">&#34;Percy, if you think about it - &#34;</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, I intend to,&#34; he said, brushing past me. &#34;I intend to think about it very hard. Starting right now. On</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">my way home. One of you boys can clock me out at quitting time.&#34; He reached the door of the restraint</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">room and turned to survey us with a look of angry, embarrassed contempt - a deadly combination for the</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="375" height="19" font="3">secret we'd had some fool's hope of keeping.</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="534" height="19" font="3">&#34;Unless, of course, you want to try explaining why I left early.&#34;</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">He left the room and went striding up the Green Mile, forgetting in his agitation why that green floored</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">central corridor was so wide. He had mad this mistake once before and had gotten away with it. He</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="281" height="19" font="3">would not get away with it again.</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">I followed him out the door, trying to think of a way to soothe him down - I didn't want him leaving E</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Block the way he was now, sweaty and dishevelled, with the red print of my hand still on his cheek. The</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="206" height="19" font="3">other three followed me.</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">What happened then happened very fast - it was all over in no more than a minute, perhaps even less. Yet</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">I remember all of it to this day - mostly, I think, because I told Janice everything when I got home and</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">that set it in my mind. What happened afterward - the dawn meeting with Curtis Anderson, the inquest,</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the press-meeting Hal Moores set up for us (he was back by then, of course), and the eventual Board of</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Enquiry in the state capital - those things have blurred over the years like so much else in my memory.</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">But as to what actually happened next there on the Green Mile, yes, that I remember perfectly well.</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Percy was walking up the right side of the Mile with his head lowered, and I'll say this much: no ordinary</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Prisoner could have reached him. John Coffey wasn't an ordinary prisoner, though. John Coffey was a</text>

<page number="182" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="273" height="19" font="3">giant, and he had a giant's reach.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I saw his long brown arms shoot out from between the bars and yelled, &#34;<i>Watchit, Percy, watch it!&#34;</i> Percy</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">started to turn, his left hand dropping to the butt of his stick. Then he was seized and yanked against the</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="631" height="19" font="3">front of John Coffey's cell, the right side of his face smashing into the bars.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">He grunted and turned toward Coffey, raising the hickory club. John was certainly vulnerable to it; his</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">own face was pressed so strenuously into the space between two of the center bars that he looked as if he</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">was trying to squeeze his entire head through. It would have been impossible, of course, but that was</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">how it looked. His right hand groped, found the nape of Percy's neck, curled around it, and yanked</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Percy's head forward. Percy brought the club down between the bars and onto John 's temple. Blood</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">flowed, but John paid no attention. His mouth pressed against Percy's mouth. I heard a whispering rush -</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">an exhalatory sound, as of long-held breath. Percy jerked like a fish on a hook, trying to get away, but he</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">never had a chance; John 's right hand was pressed to the back of his neck, holding him firm. Their faces</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="791" height="19" font="3">seemed to melt together, like the faces of lovers I have seen kissing passionately through bars.</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">Percy screamed, the sound muffled as it had been through the tape, and made another effort to pull back.</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">For an instant their lips came apart a little, and I saw the black, swirling tide that was flowing out of John</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Coffey and into Percy Wetmore. What wasn't going into him through his quivering mouth was flowing in</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">by way of his nostrils. Then the hand on the nape of his neck flexed, and Percy was pulled forward onto</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="393" height="19" font="3">John 's mouth again; was almost impaled on it.</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Percy's left hand sprang open. His treasured hickory baton fell to the green linoleum. He never picked it</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="77" height="19" font="3">up again.</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">I tried to lunge forward, I guess I <i>did</i> lunge forward, but my movements felt old and creaky to myself. I</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">grabbed for my gun, but the strap was still across the burled-walnut grip, and at first I couldn't get it out</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">of its holster. Beneath me, I seemed to feel the floor shake as it had in the back bedroom of the Warden's</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">neat little Cape Cod. That I'm not sure of, but I know that one of the caged lightbulbs overhead broke.</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="511" height="19" font="3">Fragments of glass showered down. Harry yelled in surprise.</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">At last I managed to thumb loose the safety strap over the butt of my .38, but before I could pull it out of</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">its holster, John had thrust Percy away from him and stepped back into his cell. John was grimacing and</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="449" height="19" font="3">rubbing his mouth, as if he had tasted something bad.</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="462" height="19" font="3">&#34;What'd he do?&#34; Brutal shouted. &#34;What'd he do, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="499" height="19" font="3">&#34;Whatever he took out of Melly, Percy's got it now,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Percy was standing against the bars of Delacroix's old cell. His eyes were wide and blank-double zeros. I</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">approached him carefully, expecting him to start coughing and choking the way John had after he'd</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="542" height="19" font="3">finished with Melinda, but he didn't. At first he only stood there.</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="615" height="19" font="3">I snapped my fingers in front of his eyes. &#34;Percy! Hey, Percy! Wake up!&#34;</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="703" height="19" font="3">Nothing. Brutal joined me, and reached toward Percy's empty face with both hands.</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="280" height="19" font="3">&#34;That isn't going to work,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Ignoring me, Brutal clapped his hands sharply together twice, right in front of Percy's nose. And it <i>did</i></text>
</page>
<page number="183" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">work, or appeared to work. His eyelids fluttered and he stared around -dazed, like someone hit over the</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">head struggling back to consciousness. He looked from Brutal to me. All these years later, I'm pretty sure</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="717" height="19" font="3">he didn't see either of us, but I thought he did then; I thought he was coming out of it.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">He pushed away from the bars and swayed a little on his feet. Brutal steadied him. &#34;Easy, boy, you all</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="803" height="19" font="3">right?&#34; Percy didn't answer, just stepped past Brutal and turned toward the duty desk. He wasn't</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">staggering, exactly, but he was listing to port.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Brutal reached out for him. I pushed his hand away. &#34;Leave him alone.&#34; Would I have said the same if I'd</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">known what was going to happen next? I've asked myself that question a thousand times since the fall of</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="271" height="19" font="3">1932. There's never any answer.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">Percy made twelve or fourteen paces, then stopped again, head lowered. He was outside of Wild Bill</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Wharton's cell by then. Wharton was still making those sousaphone noises. He slept through the whole</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">thing. He slept through his own death, now that I think of it, which made him a lot luckier than most of</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="3">the men who ended up here. Certainly luckier than he deserved.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">Before we knew what was happening, Percy drew his gun, stepped to the bars of Wharton's cell, and</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">emptied all six shots into the sleeping man&#34; just bam-bam-bam, bam-bam-bam, as fast as he could pull</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">the trigger. The sound in that enclosed space was deafening; when I told Janice the story the next</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="736" height="19" font="3">morning, I could still hardly hear the sound of my own voice for the ringing in my ears.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">We ran at him, all four of us. Dean got there first - I don't know how, as he was behind Brutal and me</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">when Coffey had hold of Percy - but he did. He grabbed Percy's wrist, prepared to wrestle the gun out of</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Percy's hand, but he didn't have to. Percy just let go, and the gun fell to the floor. His eyes went across us</text>
<text top="590" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">like they were skates and we were ice. There was a low hissing sound and a sharp ammoniac smell as</text>
<text top="614" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Percy's bladder let go, then a brrrap sound and a thicker stink as he filled the other side of his pants, as</text>
<text top="638" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">well. His eyes had settled on a far corner of the corridor. They were eyes that never saw anything in this</text>
<text top="662" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">real world of ours again, so far as I know. Back near the beginning of this I wrote that Percy was at Briar</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Ridge by the time that Brutal found the colored slivers of Mr. Jingles's spool a couple of months later,</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">and I didn't lie about that. He never got the office with the fan in the comer, though; never got a bunch of</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="753" height="19" font="3">lunatic patients to push around, either. But I imagine he at least got his own private room.</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="246" height="19" font="3">He had connections, after all.</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">Wharton was lying on his side with his back against the wall of his cell. I couldn't see much then but a lot</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">of blood soaking into the sheet and splattered across the cement, but the coroner said Percy had shot like</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Annie Oakley. Remembering Dean's story of how Percy had thrown his hickory baton at the mouse that</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">time and barely missed, I wasn't too surprised. This time the range had been shorter and the target not</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="634" height="19" font="3">moving. One in the groin, one in the gut, one in the chest, three in the head.</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Brutal was coughing and waving at the haze of gunsmoke. I was coughing myself, but hadn't noticed it</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="85" height="19" font="3">until then.</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;End of the line,&#34; Brutal said. His voice was calm, but there was no mistaking the glaze of panic in his</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="43" height="19" font="3">eyes.</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I looked down the hallway and saw John Coffey sitting on the end of his bunk. His hands were clasped</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">between his knees again, but his head was up and he no longer looked a bit sick. He nodded at me</text>
</page>
<page number="184" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">slightly, and I surprised myself - as I had on the day I offered him my hand - by returning the nod.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="699" height="19" font="3">&#34;What are we going to do?&#34; Harry gibbered. &#34;Oh Christ, what are we going to do?&#34;</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="755" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nothing we can do,&#34; Brutal said in that same calm voice. &#34;We're hung. Aren't we, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">My mind had begun to move very fast. I looked at Harry and Dean, who were staring at me like scared</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">kids. I looked at Percy, who was standing there with his hands and jaw dangling. Then I looked at my old</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="189" height="19" font="3">friend, Brutus Howell.</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="274" height="19" font="3">&#34;We're going to be okay,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">Percy at last commenced coughing. He doubled over, hands on his knees, almost retching. His face began</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">to turn red. I opened my mouth, meaning to tell the others to stand back, but I never got a chance. He</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">made a sound that was a cross between a dry heave and a bullfrog's croak, opened his mouth, and spewed</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">out a cloud of black, swirling stuff. It was so thick that for a moment we couldn't see his head. Harry said</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh God save us&#34; in a weak and watery voice. Then the stuff turned a white so dazzling it was like</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="821" height="19" font="3">January sun on fresh snow. A moment later the cloud was gone. Percy straightened slowly up and</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="506" height="19" font="3">resumed his vacant gaze down the length of the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">&#34;We didn't see that,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Did we, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="434" height="19" font="3">&#34;No. I didn't and you didn't. Did you see it, Harry?&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="147" height="19" font="3">&#34;No,&#34; Harry said.</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="71" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dean?&#34;</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;See what?&#34; Dean took his glasses off and began to polish them. I thought he would drop them out of his</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="338" height="19" font="3">trembling hands, but he managed not to.</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34; See what, that's good. That's just the ticket. Now listen to your scoutmaster, boys, and get it right the</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="632" height="19" font="3">first time, because time is short. It's a simple story. Let's not complicate it.&#34;</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>3.</b></text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">I told all this to Jan at around eleven o'clock that <i>morning - the next morning,</i> I almost wrote, but of</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">course it was the same day. The longest one of my whole life, without a doubt. I told it pretty much as I</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">have here, finishing with how William Wharton had ended up lying dead on his bunk, riddled with lead</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="183" height="19" font="3">from Percy's sidearm.</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">No, that's not right. What I actually finished with was the stuff that came out of Percy, the bugs or the</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="649" height="19" font="3">whatever-it-was. That was a hard thing to tell, even to your wife, but I told it.</text>
<text top="956" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">As I talked, she brought me black coffee by the half-cup at first my hands were shaking too badly to pick</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">up a whole one without spilling it. By the time I finished, the shaking had eased some, and I felt that I</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">could even take some food an egg, maybe, or some soup.</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="607" height="19" font="3">&#34;The thing that saved us was that we didn't really have to lie, any of us.&#34;</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="791" height="19" font="3">&#34;Just leave a few things out,&#34; she said, and nodded. &#34;Little things, mostly, like how you took a</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">condemned murderer out of prison, and how he cured a dying woman, and how he drove that Percy</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="638" height="19" font="3">Wetmore crazy by - what? - spitting a pureed brain tumor down his throat?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know, Jan,&#34; I said. &#34;I only know that if you keep talking like that, you'll end up either eating that</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="330" height="19" font="3">soup yourself, or feeding it to the dog.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="289" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm sorry. But I'm right, aren't I?&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah,&#34; I said. Except we got away with the-&#34; The what? You couldn't call it an escape, and furlough</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">wasn't right, either. &#34;the field trip. Not even Percy can tell them about that, if he ever comes back.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="450" height="19" font="3">&#34;If he comes back,&#34; she echoed. &#34;How likely is that?&#34;</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">I shook my head to indicate I had no idea. But I did, actually; I didn't think he was going to come back,</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">not in 1932, not in '42 or '52, either. In that I was right. Percy Wetmore stayed at Briar Ridge until it</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">burned flat in 1944. Seventeen inmates were killed in that fire, but Percy wasn't one of them. Still silent</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">and blank in every regard-the word I learned to describe that state is catatonic - he was led out by one of</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">the guards long before the fire reached his wing. He went on to another institution - I don't remember the</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">name and guess it doesn't matter, anyway - and died in 1965. So far as I know, the last time he ever</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">spoke was when he told us we could clock him out at quitting time... unless we wanted to explain why he</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="116" height="19" font="3">had left early.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">The irony was that we never had to explain much of anything. Percy had gone crazy and shot William</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Wharton to death. That was what we told, and so far as it went, every word was true. When Anderson</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">asked Brutal how Percy had seemed before the shooting and Brutal answered with one word - &#34;Quiet&#34; - I</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">had a terrible moment when I felt that I might burst out laughing. Because that was true, too, Percy <i>had</i></text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">been quiet, for most of his shift he'd had a swatch of friction-tape across his mouth and the best he'd been</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="445" height="19" font="3">able to come up with was <i>mmmph, mmmph, mmmph.</i></text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Curtis kept Percy there until eight o'clock, Percy as silent as a cigar-store Indian but a lot more eerie. By</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">then Hal Moores had arrived, looking grim but competent, ready to climb back into the saddle. Curtis</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Anderson let him do just that, and with a sigh of relief the rest of us could almost hear. The bewildered,</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">frightened old man was gone; it was the Warden who strode up to Percy, grabbed him by the shoulders</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="335" height="19" font="3">with his big hands, and shook him hard.</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Son!&#34; he shouted into Percy's blank face - a face that was already starting to soften like wax, I thought.</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="707" height="19" font="3">&#34;Son! Do you hear me? Talk to me if you hear me! I want to know what happened!&#34;</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Nothing from Percy, of course. Anderson wanted to get the Warden aside, discuss how they were going</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">to handle it -it was a political hot potato if there had ever been one-but Moores put him off, at least for</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">the time being, and drew me down the Mile. John Coffey was lying on his bunk with his face to the wall,</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">legs dangling outrageously, as they always did. He appeared to be sleeping and probably was ... but he</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="453" height="19" font="3">wasn't always what he appeared, as we had found out.</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;Did what happened at my house have anything to do with what happened here when you got back?&#34;</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">Moores asked in a low voice. &#34;I'll cover you as much as I can, even if it means my job, but I have to</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">know.&#34;</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">I shook my head. When I spoke, I also kept my voice low-pitched. There were now almost a dozen</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">screws milling around at the head of the aisle. Another was photographing Wharton in his cell. Curtis</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">Anderson had turned to watch that, and for the time being, only Brutal was watching us. &#34;No, sir. We got</text>

<page number="186" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">John back into his cell just like you see, then let Percy out of the restraint room, where we'd stashed him</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">for safekeeping. I thought he'd be hot under the collar, but he wasn't. Just asked for his sidearm and</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">baton. He didn't say anything else, just walked off up the corridor. Then, when he got to Wharton's cell</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="332" height="19" font="3">he pulled his gun and started shooting.&#34;</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="584" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do You think being in the restraint room ... something to his mind?&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="80" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, sir.&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="315" height="19" font="3">&#34;Did you put him in the straitjacket?&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="248" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, sir. There was no need.&#34;</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="275" height="19" font="3">&#34;He was quiet? Didn't struggle?&#34;</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="121" height="19" font="3">&#34;No struggle.&#34;</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="786" height="19" font="3">&#34;Even when he saw you meant to put him in restraint room, he was quiet and didn't struggle.&#34;</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right.&#34; I felt an urge to embroider on this to give Percy at least a line or two - and conquered it.</text>
<text top="443" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Simpler would be better, and I knew it. &#34;There, was no fuss. He just went over into one of the far corners</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="494" height="19" font="3">and sat down.&#34; &#34;Didn't speak of Wharton then?&#34; &#34;No, sir. &#34;</text>
<text top="506" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;Didn't speak of Coffey, either?&#34; I shook my head. &#34;Could Percy have been laying for Wharton? Did he</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="287" height="19" font="3">have something against the man?&#34;</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;That might be,&#34; I said, lowering my voice even more. &#34;Percy was careless about where he walked, Hal.</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">One time Wharton reached out, grabbed him up against the bars, and messed him over some.&#34; I paused.</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="246" height="19" font="3">&#34;Felt him up, you could say.&#34;</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="566" height="19" font="3">&#34;No worse than that? just ... 'messed him over, ... and that was all?&#34;</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, but it was pretty bad for Percy, just the same. Wharton said something about how he'd rather screw</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="218" height="19" font="3">Percy than Percy's sister.&#34;</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">&#34;Urn.&#34; Moores kept looking sideways at John Coffey, as if he needed constant reassurance that Coffey</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">was a real person, actually in the world. &#34;It doesn't explain what's happened to him, but it goes a good</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="824" height="19" font="3">piece toward explaining why it was Wharton he turned on and not Coffey or one of you men. And</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="518" height="19" font="3">speaking of your men, Paul, will they all tell the same story?&#34;</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir,&#34; I told him. &#34;And they will,&#34; I said to Jan, starting in on the soup she brought to the table. &#34;I'll</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">see to it.&#34;</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="349" height="19" font="3">&#34;<i>You did</i> lie,&#34; she said. &#34;You lied to Hal.&#34;</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Well, that's a wife for you, isn't it? Always poking around for moth-holes in your best suit, and finding</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="206" height="19" font="3">one more often than not.</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;I guess, if you want to look at it that way. I didn't tell him anything we both won't be able to live with,</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">though. Hal's in the clear, I think. He wasn't even <i>there,</i> after all. He was home tending his wife until</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="158" height="19" font="3">Curtis called him.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="187" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="271" height="19" font="3">&#34;Did he say how Melinda was?&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="808" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not then, there wasn't time, but we spoke again just as Brutal and I were leaving. Melly doesn't</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="742" height="19" font="3">remember much, but she's fine. Up and walking. Talking about next year's flower beds.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">My wife sat watching me eat for some little time. Then she asked, &#34;Does Hal know it's a miracle, Paul?</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="220" height="19" font="3">Does he understand that?&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="355" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. We all do, all of us that were there.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Part of me wishes I'd been there, too,&#34; she said, &#34;but I think most of me is glad I wasn't. If I'd seen the</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">scales fall from Saul's eyes on the road to Damascus. I probably would have died of a heart attack.&#34;</text>
<text top="302" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Naw,&#34; I said, tilting my bowl to capture the last spoonful, &#34;probably would have cooked him some soup.</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="205" height="19" font="3">This is pretty fine, hon.&#34;</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;Good.&#34; But she wasn't really thinking about soup or cooking or Saul's conversion on the Damascus road.</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">She was looking out the window toward the ridges, her chin propped on her hand, her eyes as hazy as</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">those ridges look on summer mornings when it's going to be hot. Summer mornings like the one when</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">the Detterick girls had been found, I thought for no reason. I wondered why they hadn't screamed.</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Their killer had hurt them; there had been blood on the porch, and on the steps. So why hadn't they</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="89" height="19" font="3">screamed?</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;You think John Coffey really killed that man Wharton, don't you?&#34; Janice asked, looking back from the</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">window at last. &#34;Not that it was an accident, or anything like that; you think he used Percy Wetmore on</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="175" height="19" font="3">Wharton like a gun.&#34;</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="55" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes.&#34;</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="67" height="19" font="3">&#34;Why?&#34;</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="123" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know.'</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;Tell me again about what happened when you took Coffey off the Mile, would you? Just that part.&#34;</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">So I did. I told her how the skinny arm shooting out from between the bars and grabbing John 's bicep</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">had reminded me of a snake-one of the water moccasins we were all scared of when we were kids</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">swimming in the river - and how Coffey had said Wharton was a bad man. Almost whispering it.</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">&#34;And Wharton said ... ?&#34; My wife was looking out the window again, but she was listening, all right.</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="480" height="19" font="3">&#34;Wharton said, 'That's right, nigger, bad as you'd want., &#34;</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="133" height="19" font="3">&#34;And that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. I had a feeling that something was going to happen right then, but nothing did. Brutal took</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">Wharton's hand off John and told him to lie down, which Wharton did. He was out on his feet to start</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">with. Said something about how niggers should have their own electric chair, and that was all. We went</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="170" height="19" font="3">about our business.&#34;</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="311" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey called him a bad man.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="188" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep. Said the same thing about Percy once, too. Maybe more than once. I can't remember exactly when,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="162" height="19" font="3">but I know he did.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">&#34;But Wharton never did anything to John Coffey personally, did he? Like he did to Percy, I mean.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">&#34;No. The way their cells were - Wharton up by the duty desk on one side, John down a ways on the other</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="297" height="19" font="3">- they could hardly see each other.&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="546" height="19" font="3">&#34;Tell me again how Coffey looked when Wharton grabbed him.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="329" height="19" font="3">&#34;Janice, this isn't getting us anywhere.&#34;</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="525" height="19" font="3">&#34;Maybe it isn't and maybe it is. Tell me again how he looked.&#34;</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">I sighed. &#34;I guess you'd have to say shocked. He gasped. Like you would if you were sunning at the</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">beach and I snuck up and trickled a little cold water down your back. Or like he'd been slapped.&#34;</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well, sure,&#34; she said. &#34;Being grabbed out of nowhere like that startled him, woke him up for a second.&#34;</text>
<text top="419" left="15" width="253" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes,&#34; I said. And then, &#34;No.&#34;</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="256" height="19" font="3">&#34;Well which is it? Yes or no?&#34;</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;No. It wasn't being <i>startled.</i> It was like when he wanted me to come into his cell so he could cure my</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="819" height="19" font="3">infection. Or when he wanted me to hand him the mouse. It was being surprised, but not by being</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="532" height="19" font="3">touched ... not <i>exactly, </i>anyway ... oh Christ, Jan, I don't know.&#34;</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right, we'll leave it,&#34; she said. &#34;I just can't imagine why John did it, that's all. It's not as if he's violent</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">by nature. Which leads to another question, Paul: how can you execute him if you're right about those</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="612" height="19" font="3">girls? How can you possibly put him in the electric chair if someone else</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I jerked in my chair. My elbow struck my bowl and knocked it off onto the floor, where it broke. An idea</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">had come to me. It was more intuition than logic at that point, but it had a certain black elegance.</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="406" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul?&#34; Janice asked, alarmed. &#34;What's wrong?&#34;</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="746" height="19" font="3">&#34;I don't know,&#34; I said. &#34;I don't know anything for sure, but I'm going to find out if I can.&#34;</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>4.</b></text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">The aftermath of the shooting was a three-ring circus with the governor in one ring, the prison in another,</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">and poor brain-blasted Percy Wetmore in the third. And the ringmaster? Well, the various gentlemen of</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">the press took turns at that job. They weren't as bad then as they are now - they didn't allow themselves to</text>
<text top="923" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">be as bad - but even back then before Geraldo and Mike Wallace and the rest of them, they could gallop</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">along pretty good when they really got the bit in their teeth. That was what happened this time, and while</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="292" height="19" font="3">the show lasted, it was a good one.</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">But even the liveliest circus, the one with the scariest freaks, funniest clowns, and wildest animals, has to</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">leave town eventually. This one left after the Board of Enquiry, which sounds pretty special and</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">fearsome, but actually turned out to be pretty tame and perfunctory. Under other circumstances, the</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">governor undoubtedly would have demanded someone's head on a platter, but not this time. His nephew</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">by marriage - his wife's own blood kin - had gone crackers and killed a man. Had killed a killer - there</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">was that, at least, and thank God for it - but Percy had still shot the man as he lay sleeping in his cell,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">which was not quite sporting. When you added in the fact that the young man in question remained just</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">as mad as a March hare, you could understand why the governor only wanted it to go away, and as soon</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="97" height="19" font="3">as possible.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Our trip to Warden Moores's house in Harry Terwilliger's truck never came out. The fact that Percy had</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">been straitjacketed and locked in the restraint room during the time we were away never came out. The</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">fact that William Wharton had been doped to the gills when Percy shot him never came out, either. Why</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">would it? The authorities had no reason to suspect anything in Wharton's system but half a dozen slugs.</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">The coroner removed those, the mortician put him in a pine box, and that was the end of the man with</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="737" height="19" font="3">Billy <i>the Kid</i> tattooed on his left forearm. Good riddance to bad rubbish, you might say.</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">All in all, the uproar lasted about two weeks. During that time I didn't dare fart sideways, let alone so</text>
<text top="329" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">take a day off to investigate the idea I'd gotten at my kitchen table on the morning after all the upheavals.</text>
<text top="353" left="15" width="818" height="19" font="3">I knew for sure that the circus had left town when I got to work on a day just shy of the middle of</text>
<text top="377" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">November - the twelfth, I think, but don't hold me to that. That was the day I found the piece of paper I'd</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">been dreading on the middle of my desk: the DOE on John Coffey. Curtis Anderson had signed it instead</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">of Hal Moores, but of course it was just as legal either way, and of course it had needed to go through</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">Hal in order to get to me. I could imagine Hal sitting at his desk in Administration with that piece of</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">paper in his hand, sitting there and thinking of his wife, who had become something of a nine days,</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">wonder to the doctors at Indianola General Hospital. She'd had her own DOE papers handed to her by</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">those doctors, but John Coffey had tom them up. Now, however, it was Coffey's turn to walk the Green</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="582" height="19" font="3">Mile, and who among us could stop it? Who among us <i>would</i> stop it?</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">The date on the death warrant was November 20th. Three days after I got it - the fifteenth, I think I had</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Janice call me in sick. A cup of coffee later I was driving north in my badly sprung but otherwise reliable</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Ford. Janice had kissed me on my way and wished me good luck; I'd thanked her but no longer had any</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">clear idea what good luck would be - finding what I was looking for or not finding it. All I knew for sure</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="515" height="19" font="3">is that I didn't feel much like singing as I drove. Not that day.</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">By three that afternoon I was well up in the ridge country. I got to the Purdom County Courthouse just</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">before it closed, looked at some records, then had a visit from the Sheriff, who had been informed by the</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">county clerk that a stranger was poking in amongst the local skeletons. Sheriff Catlett wanted to know</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">what I thought I was doing. I told him. Catlett thought it over and then told me something interesting. He</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">said he'd deny he'd ever said a word if I spread it around, and it wasn't conclusive anyway, but it was</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">something, all right. It was sure something. I thought about it all the way home, and that night there was</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="558" height="19" font="3">a lot of thinking and precious little sleeping on my side of the bed.</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">The next day I got up while the sun was still just a rumor in the east and drove downstate to Trapingus</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">County. I skirted around Homer Cribus, that great bag of guts and waters, speaking to Deputy Sheriff</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">Rob McGee instead. McGee didn't want to hear what I was telling him. Most vehemently didn't want to</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">hear it. At one point I was pretty sure he was going to punch me in the mouth so he could stop hearing it,</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">but in the end he agreed to go out and ask Klaus Detterick a couple of questions. Mostly, I think, so he</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">could be sure I wouldn't. &#34;He's only thirty-nine, but he looks like an old man these days,&#34; McGee said,</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;and he don't need a smartass prison guard who thinks he's a detective to stir him up just when some of</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">the sorrow has started to settle. You stay right here in town. I don't want you within hailing distance of</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">the Detterick farm, but I want to be able to find you when I'm done talking to Klaus. If you start feeling</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">restless, have a piece of pie down there in the diner. It'll weight you down.&#34; I ended up having two</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="274" height="19" font="3">pieces, and it was kind of heavy.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">When McGee came into the diner and sat down at the counter next to me, I tried to read his face and</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="196" height="19" font="3">failed. &#34;Well?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="814" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come on home with me, we'll talk there,&#34; he said. &#34;This place is a mite too public for my taste.&#34;</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">We had our conference on Rob McGee's front porch. Both. of us were bundled up and chilly, but Mrs.</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">McGee didn't allow smoking anywhere in her house. She was a woman ahead of her time. McGee talked</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">awhile. He did it like a man who doesn't in the least enjoy what he's hearing out of his own mouth.</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;It proves nothing, you know that, don't you?&#34; he asked when he was pretty well done. His tone was</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">belligerent, and he poked his home-rolled cigarette at me in an aggressive way as he spoke, but his face</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">was sick. Not all proof is what you see and hear in a court of law, and we both knew it. I have an idea</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">that was the only time in his life when Deputy McGee wished he was as country-dumb as his boss.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="138" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;And if you're thinking of getting him a new trial on the basis of this one thing, you better think again,</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="4"><i>senor. John</i> Coffey is a Negro, and in Trapingus County we're awful particular about giving new trials to</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="84" height="19" font="3">Negroes.&#34;</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="155" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know that, too.&#34;</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="263" height="19" font="3">&#34;So what are you going to do?&#34;</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">I pitched my cigarette over the porch rail and into the street. Then I stood up. It was going to be a long,</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">cold ride back home, and the sooner I got going the sooner the trip would be done. &#34;That I wish I did</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">know, Deputy McGee,&#34; I said, &#34;but I don't. The only thing I know tonight for a fact is that second piece</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="185" height="19" font="3">of pie was a mistake.&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'll tell you something, smart guy,&#34; he said, still speaking in that tone of hollow belligerence. &#34;I don't</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="533" height="19" font="3">think you should have opened Pandora's Box in the first place.&#34;</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="451" height="19" font="3">&#34;It wasn't me opened it,&#34; I said, and then drove home.</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">I got there late - after midnight - but my wife was waiting up for me. I'd suspected she would be, but it</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">still did my heart good to see her, and to have her put her arms around my neck and her body nice and</text>
<text top="863" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">firm against mine. &#34;Hello, stranger,&#34; she said, and then touched me down below. &#34;Nothing wrong with</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="475" height="19" font="3">this fellow now, is there? He's just as healthy as can be.&#34;</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes ma'am,&#34; I said, and lifted her up in my arms. I took her into the bedroom and we made love as</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">sweet as sugar, and as I came to my climax, that delicious feeling of going out and letting go, I thought of</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">John Coffey's endlessly weeping eyes. And of Melinda Moores saying I <i>dreamed you were wandering in</i></text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="191" height="19" font="4"><i>the dark, and so was I.</i></text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Still lying on top of my wife, with her arms around my neck and our thighs together, I began to weep</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="62" height="19" font="3">myself.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul!&#34; she said, shocked and afraid. I don't think she'd seen me in tears more than half a dozen times</text>
</page>
<page number="191" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">before in the entire course of our marriage. I have never been, in the ordinary course of things, a crying</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="198" height="19" font="3">man. &#34;Paul, what is it?&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;I know everything there is to know,&#34; I said through my tears. &#34;I know too goddam much, if you want to</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">know the truth. I'm supposed to electrocute John Coffey in less than a week's time, but it was William</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="484" height="19" font="3">Wharton who killed the Detterick girls. It was Wild Bill.&#34;</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>5.</b></text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">The next day, the same bunch of screws who had eaten lunch in my kitchen after the botched Delacroix</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">execution ate lunch there again. This time there was a fifth at our council of war: my wife. It was Jan</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">who convinced me to tell the others; my first impulse had been not to. Wasn't it bad enough, I asked her,</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="121" height="19" font="3">that we knew?</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're not thinking clear about it,&#34; she'd answered. &#34;Probably because you're still upset. They already</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">know the worst thing, that John's on the spot for a crime he didn't commit. If anything, this makes it a</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="105" height="19" font="3">little better.&#34;</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">I wasn't so sure, but I deferred to her judgement. I expected an uproar when I told Brutal, Dean, and</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">Harry what I knew (I couldn't prove it, but I knew, all right), but at first there was only thoughtful</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">silence. Then, taking another of Janice's biscuits and beginning to put an outrageous amount of butter on</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">it, Dean said: &#34;Did John see him, do you think? Did he see Wharton drop the girls, maybe even rape</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="60" height="19" font="3">them?&#34;</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">&#34;I think if he'd seen that, he would have tried to stop it,&#34; I said. &#34;As for seeing Wharton, maybe as he ran</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="481" height="19" font="3">off, I suppose he might have. If he did, he forgot it later.&#34;</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sure,&#34; Dean said. &#34;He's special, but that doesn't make him bright. He only found out it was Wharton</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="584" height="19" font="3">when Wharton reached through the bars of his cell and touched him.&#34;</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">Brutal was nodding. &#34;That's why John looked so surprised ... so shocked. Remember the way his eyes</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">opened?&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">I nodded. &#34;He used Percy on Wharton like a gun, that was what Janice said, and it was what I kept</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">thinking about. Why would John Coffey want to kill Wild Bill? <i>Percy,</i> maybe -Percy stamped on</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">Delacroix's mouse right in front of him, Percy burned Delacroix alive and John knew it - but Wharton?</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">Wharton messed with most of us in one way or another, but he didn't mess with John at all, so far as I</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">know -hardly passed four dozen words with him the whole time they were on the Mile together, and half</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">of those were that last night. Why would he want to? He was from Purdom County, and as far as white</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">boys from up there are concerned, you don't even see a Negro unless he happens to step into your road.</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">So why did he do it? What could he've seen or felt when Wharton touched him that was so bad that he</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="440" height="19" font="3">saved back the poison he took out of Melly's body?&#34;</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="429" height="19" font="3">&#34;And half-killed himself doing it, too,&#34; Brutal said.</text>
<text top="1016" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">&#34;More like three-quarters. And the Detterick twins were all I could think of that was bad enough to</text>
<text top="1040" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">explain what he did. I told myself the idea was nuts, too much of a coincidence, it just couldn't be. Then I</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">remembered something Curtis Anderson wrote in the first memo I ever got about Wharton -that Wharton</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">was crazy-wild, and that he'd rambled all over the state before the holdup where he killed all those</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">people. <i>Rambled all over the state.</i> That stuck with me. Then there was the way he tried to choke Dean</text>
</page>
<page number="192" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="407" height="19" font="3">when he came in. That got me thinking about - &#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;The dog,&#34; Dean said. He was rubbing his neck where Wharton had wrapped the chain. I don't think he</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="523" height="19" font="3">even knew he was doing it. &#34;How the dog's neck was broken.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;Anyway, I went on up to Purdom County to check Wharton's court records - all we had here were the</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">reports on the murders that got him to the Green Mile. The end of his career, in other words. I wanted the</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="98" height="19" font="3">beginning.&#34;</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="259" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lot of trouble?&#34; Brutal asked.</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yeah. Vandalism, petty theft, setting haystack fires, even theft of an explosive - he and a friend swiped</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">a stick of dynamite and set it off down by a creek. He got going early, ten years old, but what I wanted</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">wasn't there. Then the Sheriff turned up to see who I was and what I was doing, and that was actually</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">lucky. I fibbed, told him that a cell-search had turned up a bunch of pictures in Wharton's mattress - little</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">girls with no clothes on. I said I'd wanted to see if Wharton had any kind of history as a pederast, because</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">there were a couple of unsolved cases up in Tennessee that I'd heard about. I was careful never to</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="606" height="19" font="3">mention the Detterick twins. I don't think they crossed his mind, either.&#34;</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="674" height="19" font="3">&#34;Course not&#34;, Harry said. &#34;Why would they have? That case is solved, after all.&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;I said I guessed there was no sense chasing the idea, since there was nothing in Wharton's back file. I</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">mean, there was plenty in the file, but none of it about that sort of thing. Then the Sheriff - Catlett, his</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">name is - laughed and said not everything a bad apple like Bill Wharton did was in the court files, and</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">what did it matter, anyway? He was dead, wasn't he?</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;I said I was doing it just to satisfy my own curiosity, nothing else, and that relaxed him. He took me</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">back to his office, sat me down, gave me a cup of coffee and a sinker, and told me that sixteen months</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">ago, when Wharton was barely eighteen, a man in the western part of the county caught him in the barn</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="794" height="19" font="3">with his daughter. It wasn't rape, exactly; the fellow described it to Catlett as 'not much more'n</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="229" height="19" font="3">stinkfinger., Sorry, honey.&#34;</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="460" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's all right&#34;, Janice said. She looked pale, though.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="319" height="19" font="3">&#34;How old was the girl?&#34; Brutal asked.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="120" height="19" font="3">&#34;Nine&#34;, I said.</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="96" height="19" font="3">He winced.</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;The man might've taken off after Wharton himself, if he'd had him some big old brothers or cousins to</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">give him a help, but he didn't. So he went to Catlett, but made it clear he only wanted Wharton warned.</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">No one wants a nasty thing like that right out in public, if it can be helped. Anyway, Sheriff C. had been</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">dealing with Wharton's antics for quite some time - had him in the reform school up that way for eight</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">months or so when Wharton was fifteen - and he decided enough was enough. He got three deputies, they</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">went out to the Wharton place, set Missus Wharton aside when she started to weep and wail, and then</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">they warned Mr. William 'Billy the Kid, Wharton what happens to big pimple-faced galoots who go up in</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">the hayloft with girls not even old enough to have heard about their monthly courses, let alone started</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">them. 'We warned that little punk good&#34; Catlett told me. 'Warned him until his head was bleedin, his</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="500" height="19" font="3">shoulder was dislocated, and his ass was damn near broke.&#34;</text>

<text top="41" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">Brutal was laughing in spite of himself. &#34;That sounds like Purdom County, all right,&#34; he said. &#34;Like as</text>
<text top="65" left="15" width="41" height="19" font="3">not.&#34;</text>
<text top="104" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">&#34;It was three months later, give or take, that Wharton broke out and started the spree that ended with the</text>
<text top="128" left="15" width="488" height="19" font="3">holdup,&#34; I said. &#34;That and the murders that got him to us.&#34;</text>
<text top="167" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;So he'd had something to do with an underage girl once,&#34; Harry said. He took off his glasses, huffed on</text>
<text top="191" left="15" width="609" height="19" font="3">them, polished them. &#34;Way underage. Once isn't exactly a pattern, is it?&#34;</text>
<text top="230" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;A man doesn't do a thing like that just once,&#34; my wife said, then pressed her lips together so tight they</text>
<text top="254" left="15" width="175" height="19" font="3">almost weren't there.</text>
<text top="293" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">Next I told them about my visit to Trapingus County. I'd been a lot more frank with Rob McGee - I'd had</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">no choice, really. To this day I have no idea what sort of story he spun for Mr. Detterick, but the McGee</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="599" height="19" font="3">who sat down next to me in the diner seemed to have aged seven years.</text>
<text top="380" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">In mid-May, about a month before the holdup and the murders which finished Wharton's short career as</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">an outlaw, Klaus Detterick had painted his barn (and, incidentally, Bowser's doghouse next to it). He</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">hadn't wanted his son crawling around up on a high scaffolding, and the boy had been in school, anyway,</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">so he had hired a fellow. A nice enough fellow. Very quiet. Three days, work it had been. No, the fellow</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">hadn't slept at the house, Detterick wasn't foolish enough to believe that nice and quiet always meant</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">safe, especially in those days, when there was so much dust-bowl riffraff on the roads. A man with a</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">family had to be careful. In any case, the man hadn't needed lodging; he told Detterick he had taken a</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">room in town, at Eva Price's. There was a lady named Eva Price in Tefton, and she <i>did</i> rent rooms, but</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">she hadn't had a boarder that May who fit the description of Detterick's hired man, just the usual fellows</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">in checked suits and derby hats, hauling sample cases - drummers, in other words. McGee had been able</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">to tell me that because he stopped at Mrs. Price's and checked on his way back from the Detterick farm -</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="203" height="19" font="3">that's how upset he was.</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Even so,&#34; he added, &#34;there's no law against a man sleeping rough in the woods, Mr. Edgecombe. I've</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="251" height="19" font="3">done it a time or two myself.&#34;</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">The hired man didn't sleep at the Dettericks, house, but he took dinner with them twice. He would have</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">met Howie. He would have met the girls, Cora and Kathe. He would have listened to their chatter, some</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">of which might have been about how much they looked forward to the coming summer, because if they</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">were good and the weather was good, Mommy sometimes let them sleep out on the porch, where they</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="730" height="19" font="3">could pretend they were pioneer wives crossing the Great Plains in Conestoga wagons.</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">I can see him sitting there at the table, eating roast chicken and Mrs. Detterick's rye bread, listening,</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">keeping his wolf's eyes well veiled, nodding, smiling a little, storing it all up.</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;This doesn't sound like the wildman you told me about when he first came on the Mile, Paul,&#34; Janice</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="233" height="19" font="3">said doubtfully. &#34;Not a bit.&#34;</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">&#34;You didn't see him up at Indianola Hospital, ma'am,&#34; Harry said. &#34;Just standin there with his mouth</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">open and his bare butt hangin out the back of his Johnny. Lettin us dress him. We thought he was either</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="320" height="19" font="3">drugged or foolish. Didn't we, Dean?&#34;</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="117" height="19" font="3">Dean nodded.</text>

<page number="194" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">&#34;The day after he finished the barn and left, a man wearing a bandanna mask robbed Hampey's Freight</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">Office in Jarvis,&#34; I told them. &#34;Cot away with seventy dollars. He also took an 1892 silver dollar the</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">freight agent carried as a lucky piece. That silver dollar was on Wharton when he was captured, and</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">Jarvis is only thirty miles from Tefton.&#34;</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;So this robber this wildman you think he stopped for three days to help Klaus Detterick pain his barn,&#34;</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="687" height="19" font="3">my wife said. &#34;Ate dinner with them and said please pass the peas just like folks.&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;The scariest thing about men like him is how unpredictable they are&#34;, Brutal said. &#34;He might've been</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">planning to kill the Dettericks and rifle their house, then changed his mind because a cloud came over the</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">sun at the wrong time, or something like. Maybe he just wanted to cool off a little. But most likely he</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="773" height="19" font="3">already had his eye on those two girls and was planning to come back. Do you think, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="670" height="19" font="3">I nodded. Of course I thought it. &#34;And then there's the name he gave Detterick.&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="214" height="19" font="3">&#34;What name?&#34; Jan asked.</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="130" height="19" font="3">&#34;Will Bonney.&#34;</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="168" height="19" font="3">&#34;Bonney? I don't - &#34;</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="287" height="19" font="3">&#34;It was Billy the Kid's real name.&#34;</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh.&#34; Then her eyes widened. &#34;Oh! So you can get John Coffey off! Thank God! All you have to do is</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="665" height="19" font="3">show Mr. Detterick a picture of William Wharton ... his mug-shot should do...&#34;</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Brutal and I exchanged an uncomfortable look. Dean was looking a bit hopeful, but Harry was staring</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="621" height="19" font="3">down at his hands, as if all at once fabulously interested in his fingernails.</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;What's wrong?&#34; Janice asked. &#34;Why are you looking at each other that way? Surely this man McGee</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="115" height="19" font="3">will have to-&#34;</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">&#34;Rob McGee struck me as a good man, and I think he's a hell of a law officer&#34;, I said, &#34;but he swings no</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">weight in Trapingus County. The power there is Sheriff Cribus, and the day he reopens the Detterick case</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">on the basis of what I was able to find out would be the day it snows in hell.&#34;</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;But ... if Wharton was there ... if Detterick can identify a picture of him and they <i>know</i> he was <i>there. . . &#34;</i></text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">&#34;Him being there in May doesn't mean he came back and killed those girls in June&#34;, Brutal said. He</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">spoke in a low, gentle voice, the way you speak when you're telling someone there's been a death in the</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">family. &#34;On one hand you've got this fellow who helped Klaus Detterick paint a barn and then went</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">away. Turns out he was committing crimes all over the place, but there's nothing against him for the three</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">days in May he was around Tefton. On the other hand, you've got this big Negro, this <i>huge</i> Negro, that</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="761" height="19" font="3">you found on the riverbank, holding two little dead girls, both of them naked, in his arms.&#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">He shook his head.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul's right, Jan. McGee may have his doubts, but McGee doesn't matter. Cribus is the only one who</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">can reopen the case, and Cribus doesn't want to mess with what he thinks of as a happy ending - 'it was a</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">nigger&#34; thinks he, 'and not one of our'n in any case. Beautiful. I'll go up there to Cold Mountain, have me</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="648" height="19" font="3">a steak and a draft beer at Ma's, then watch him fry, and there's an end to it, &#34;</text>

<page number="195" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">Janice listened to all this with a mounting expression of horror on her face, then turned to me. &#34;But</text>
<text top="62" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">McGee believes it, doesn't he, Paul? I could see it on your face. Deputy McGee knows he arrested the</text>
<text top="86" left="15" width="391" height="19" font="3">wrong man. Won't he stand up to the Sheriff?&#34;</text>
<text top="125" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">&#34;All he can do by standing up to him is lose his job&#34;, I said. &#34;Yes, I think that in his heart he knows it was</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">Wharton. But what he says to himself is that, if he keeps his mouth shut and plays the game until Cribus</text>
<text top="173" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">either retires or eats himself to death, he gets the job. And things will be different then. That's what he</text>
<text top="197" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">tells himself to get to sleep, I imagine. And he's probably not so much different than Homer about one</text>
<text top="221" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">thing. He'll tell himself, 'After all, it's only a Negro. It's not like they're going to burn a white man for it.,</text>
<text top="245" left="15" width="9" height="19" font="3">&#34;</text>
<text top="284" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then you'll have to go to them&#34;, Janice said, and my heart turned cold at the decisive, no-doubt-about-it</text>
<text top="308" left="15" width="484" height="19" font="3">tone of her voice. &#34;Go and tell them what you found out.&#34;</text>
<text top="347" left="15" width="788" height="19" font="3">&#34;And how should we tell them we found it out, Jan?&#34; Brutal asked her in that same low voice.</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;Should we tell them about how Wharton grabbed John while we were taking him out of the prison to</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="327" height="19" font="3">work a miracle on the Warden's wife?&#34;</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;No ... of course not, but...&#34; She saw how thin the ice was in that direction and skated in another one.</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lie, then,&#34; she said. She looked defiantly at Brutal, then turned that look on me. It was hot enough to</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="373" height="19" font="3">smoke a hole in newspaper, you'd have said.</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="302" height="19" font="3">&#34;Lie,&#34; I repeated. &#34;Lie about what?&#34;</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;About what got you going, first up to Purdom County and then down to Trapingus. Go down there to</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">that fat old Sheriff Cribus and say that Wharton <i>told you</i> he raped and murdered the Detterick girls. That</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">he confessed.&#34; She switched her hot gaze to Brutal for a moment. &#34;You can back him up, Brutus. You</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">can say you were there when he confessed, you heard it, too. Why, Percy probably heard it as well, and</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">that was probably what set him off. He shot Wharton because he couldn't stand thinking of what Wharton</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="804" height="19" font="3">had done to those children. It snapped his mind. Just ... What? What now, in the name of God?&#34;</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="772" height="19" font="3">It wasn't just me and Brutal; Harry and Dean were looking at her, too, with a kind of horror.</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">&#34;We never <i>reported</i> anything like that, ma'am,&#34; Harry said. He spoke as if talking to a child. &#34;The first</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">thing people'd ask is why we didn't. We're supposed to report anything our cell-babies say about prior</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="272" height="19" font="3">crimes. Theirs or anyone else's.&#34;</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not that we would've believed him,&#34; Brutal put in. &#34;A man like Wild Bill Wharton lies about anything,</text>
<text top="884" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">Jan. Crimes he's committed, bigshots he's known, women he's gone to bed with, touchdowns he scored in</text>
<text top="908" left="15" width="316" height="19" font="3">high school, even the damn weather.&#34;</text>
<text top="947" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;But ... but.. &#34; Her face was agonized. I went to put my arm around her and she pushed it violently away.</text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="746" height="19" font="3">&#34;<i>But he was there! He painted their goddamned barn! HE ATE DINNER WITH THEM!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;All the more reason why he might take credit for the crime,&#34; Brutal said.&#34; After all, what harm? Why</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="397" height="19" font="3">not boast? You can't fry a man twice, after all.&#34;</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;Let me see if I've got this right. We here at this table know that not only did John Coffey not kill those</text>
<text top="1097" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">girls, he was trying to save their lives. Deputy McGee doesn't know all that, of course, but he <i>does</i> have a</text>

<page number="196" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">pretty good idea that the man condemned to die for the murders didn't do them. And still ... <i>still</i> I . . you</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="449" height="19" font="3">can't get him a new trial. Can't even reopen the case.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yessum,&#34; Dean said. He was polishing his glasses furiously. &#34;That's about the size of it.&#34;</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">She sat with her head lowered, thinking. Brutal started to say something and I raised a hand, shushing</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">him. I didn't believe Janice could think of a way to get John out of the killing box he was in, but I didn't</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">believe it was impossible, either. She was a fearsomely smart lady, my wife. Fearsomely determined, as</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="602" height="19" font="3">well. That's a combination that sometimes turns mountains into valleys.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="624" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right&#34;, she said at last. &#34;Then you've got to get him out on your own.&#34;</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="463" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ma'am?&#34; Harry looked flabbergasted. Frightened, too.</text>
<text top="326" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;You can do it. You did it once, didn't you? You can do it again. Only this time you won't bring him</text>

<text top="389" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Would you want to be the one to explain to my kids why their daddy is in prison, Missus Edgecombe?&#34;</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="506" height="19" font="3">Dean asked. &#34;Charged with helping a murderer escape jail?&#34;</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="752" height="19" font="3">&#34;There won't be any of that, Dean; we'll work out a plan. Make it look like a real escape.&#34;</text>
<text top="491" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;Make sure it's a plan that could be worked out by a fellow who can't even remember how to tie his own</text>
<text top="515" left="15" width="461" height="19" font="3">shoes, then&#34;, Harry said. &#34;They'll have to believe that.&#34;</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="257" height="19" font="3">She looked at him uncertainly.</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">&#34;It wouldn't do any good,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;Even if we could think of a way, it wouldn't do any good.&#34;</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="734" height="19" font="3">&#34;Why not?&#34; She sounded as if she might be going to cry. &#34;Just why the damn hell not?&#34;</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself&#34;, I</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="729" height="19" font="3">said. &#34;How long do you think it would be before he was recaptured? Two hours? Six?&#34;</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;He got along without attracting much attention before&#34;, she said. A tear trickled down her cheek. She</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="351" height="19" font="3">slapped it away with the heel of her hand.</text>
<text top="797" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">That much was true. I had written letters to some friends and relatives of mine farther down south, asking</text>
<text top="821" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">if they'd seen anything in the papers about a man fitting John Coffey's description. Anything at all. Janice</text>
<text top="845" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">had done the same. We had come up with just one possible sighting so far, in the town of Muscle Shoals,</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Alabama. A twister had struck a church there during choir practice - in 1929, this had been -and a large</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">black man had hauled two fellows out of the rubble. Both had looked dead to onlookers at first, but as it</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">turned out, neither had been even seriously hurt. It was like a miracle, one of the witnesses was quoted as</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">saying. The black man, a drifter who had been hired by the church pastor to do a day's worth of chores,</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="291" height="19" font="3">had disappeared in the excitement.</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;You're right, he got along,&#34; Brutal said. &#34;But you have to remember that he did most of his getting along</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="550" height="19" font="3">before he was convicted of raping and murdering two little girls.&#34;</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">She sat without answering. She sat that way for almost a full minute, and then she did something which</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">shocked me as badly as my sudden flow of tears must have shocked her. She reached out and shoved</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">everything off the table with one wide sweep of her arm-plates, glasses, cups, silverware, the he bowl of</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">collards, the bowl of squash, the platter with the carved ham on it, the milk, the pitcher of cold tea. All</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="359" height="19" font="3">off the table and onto the floor, ker-smash.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">&#34;Holy shit!&#34; Dean cried, rocking back from the table so hard he damned near went over on his back.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">Janice ignored him. It was Brutal and me she was looking at, mostly me. &#34;Do you mean to kill him, you</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">cowards?&#34; she asked. &#34;Do you mean to kill the man who saved Melinda Moores's life, who tried to save</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">those little girls, lives? Well, at least there will be one less black man in the world won't there? You can</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="395" height="19" font="3">console yourselves with that. <i>One less nigger.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">She got up, looked at her chair, and kicked it into the wall. It rebounded and fell into the spilled squash. I</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="311" height="19" font="3">took her wrist and she yanked it free.</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't touch me&#34;, she said. &#34;Next week this time you'll be a murderer, no better than that man Wharton,</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="162" height="19" font="3">so don't touch me.&#34;</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">She went out onto the back stoop, put her apron up to her face, and began to sob into it. The four of us</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">looked at each other. After a little bit I got on my feet and set about cleaning up the mess. Brutal joined</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">me first, then Harry and Dean. When the place looked more or less shipshape again, they left. None of us</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="540" height="19" font="3">said a word the whole time. There was really nothing left to say.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>6.</b></text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">That was my night off. I sat in the living room of our little house, smoking cigarettes, listening to the</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">radio, and watching the dark come up out of the ground to swallow the sky. Television is all right, I've</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">nothing against it, but I don't like how it turns you away from the rest of the world and toward nothing</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="547" height="19" font="3">but its own glassy self. In that one way, at least, radio was better.</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Janice came in, knelt beside the arm of my chair, and took my hand. For a little while neither of us said</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">anything, just stayed that way, listening to Kay <i>Kyser's Kollege of Musical Knowledge</i> and watching the</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="332" height="19" font="3">stars come out. It was all right with me.</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm so sorry I called you a coward&#34;, she said. &#34;I feel worse about that than anything I've ever said to you</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="200" height="19" font="3">in our whole marriage.&#34;</text>
<text top="785" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">&#34;Even the time when we went camping and you called me Old Stinky Sam?&#34; I asked, and then we</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">laughed and had a kiss or two and it was better again between us. She was so beautiful, my Janice, and I</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">still dream of her. Old and tired of living as I am, I'll dream that she walks into my room in this lonely,</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">forgotten place where the hallways all smell of piss and old boiled cabbage, I dream she's young and</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">beautiful with her blue eyes and her fine high breasts that I couldn't hardly keep my hands off of, and</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">she'll say, <i>Why, honey, I wasn't in that bus crash. You made a mistake, that's all.</i> Even now I dream that,</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">and sometimes when I wake up and know it was a dream, I cry. I, who hardly ever cried at all when I was</text>

<text top="992" left="15" width="303" height="19" font="3">&#34;Does Hal know?&#34; she asked at last.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="3">&#34;That John 's innocent? I don't see how he can.&#34;</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="477" height="19" font="3">&#34;Can he help? Does he have any influence with Cribus?&#34;</text>

<page number="198" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="47" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">She nodded, as if she had expected this. &#34;Then don't tell him. If he can't help, for God's sake don't tell</text>
<text top="71" left="15" width="46" height="19" font="3">him.&#34;</text>
<text top="110" left="15" width="48" height="19" font="3">&#34;No.&#34;</text>
<text top="149" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">She looked up at me with steady eyes. &#34;And you won't call in sick that night. None of you will. You</text>
<text top="173" left="15" width="53" height="19" font="3">can't.&#34;</text>
<text top="212" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, we can't. If we're there, we can at least make it quick for him. We can do that much. It won't be like</text>
<text top="236" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Delacroix.&#34; For a moment, mercifully brief, I saw the black silk mask burning away from Del's face and</text>
<text top="260" left="15" width="506" height="19" font="3">revealing the cooked blobs of jelly which had been his eyes.</text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;There's no way out for you, is there?&#34; She took my hand, rubbed it down the soft velvet of her cheek.</text>
<text top="323" left="15" width="224" height="19" font="3">&#34;Poor Paul. Poor old guy.&#34;</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I said nothing. Never before or after in my life did I feel so much like running from a thing. Just taking</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="774" height="19" font="3">Jan with me, the two of us with a single packed carpetbag between us, running to anywhere.</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="487" height="19" font="3">&#34;My poor old guy&#34;, she repeated, and then: &#34;Talk to him.&#34;</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="127" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who? John ?&#34;</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="370" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes. Talk to him. Find out what <i>he</i> wants.&#34;</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="535" height="19" font="3">I thought about it, then nodded. She was right. She usually was.</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>7.</b></text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">Two days later, on the eighteenth, Bill Dodge, Hank Bitterman, and someone else - I don't remember</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">who, some floater - took John Coffey over to D Block for his shower, and we rehearsed his execution</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">while he was gone. We didn't let Toot-Toot stand in for John ; all of us knew, even without talking about</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="334" height="19" font="3">it, that it would have been an obscenity.</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="61" height="19" font="3">I did it.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey&#34;, Brutal said in a not-quite-steady voice as I sat clamped into Old Sparky, &#34;you have been</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="686" height="19" font="3">condemned to die in the electric chair, sentence passed by a jury of your peers. ..&#34;</text>
<text top="833" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">John Coffey's peers? What a joke. So far as I knew, there was no one like him on the planet. Then I</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">thought of what John had said while he stood looking at Sparky from the foot of the stairs leading down</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="513" height="19" font="3">from my office: <i>They're still in there. I hear them screaming.</i></text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="595" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get me out of it&#34;, I said hoarsely. &#34;Undo these clamps and let me up.&#34;</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="768" height="19" font="3">They did it, but for a moment I felt frozen there, as if Old Sparky did not want to let me go.</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">As we walked back to the block, Brutal spoke to me in a low voice, so not even Dean and Harry, who</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">were setting up the last of the chairs behind us, would overhear. &#34;I done a few things in my life that I'm</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="678" height="19" font="3">not proud of, but this is the first time I ever felt really actually in danger of hell.&#34;</text>
<text top="1085" left="15" width="760" height="19" font="3">I looked at him to make sure he wasn't joking. I didn't think he was. &#34;What do you mean?&#34;</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;I mean we're fixing to kill a gift of God&#34;, he said. &#34;One that never did ary harm to us, or to anyone else.</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">What am I going to say if I end up standing in front of God the Father Almighty and He asks me to</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="432" height="19" font="3">explain why I did it? That it was my job? My <i>job?&#34;</i></text>

<text top="161" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">When John got back from his shower and the floaters had left, I unlocked his cell, went in, and sat down</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">on the bunk beside him. Brutal was on the desk. He looked up, saw me in there on my own, but said</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">nothing. He just went back to whatever paperwork he was currently mangling, licking away at the tip of</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="216" height="19" font="3">his pencil the whole time.</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">John looked at me with his strange eyes - bloodshot, distant, on the verge of tears ... and yet calm, too, as</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">if crying was not such a bad way of life, not once you got used to it. He even smiled a little. He smelled</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="655" height="19" font="3">of Ivory soap, I remember, as clean and fresh as a baby after his evening bath.</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hello, boss,&#34; he said, and then reached out and took both of my hands in both of his. It was done with a</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="250" height="19" font="3">perfect unstudied naturalness.</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;Hello, John .&#34; There was a little block in my throat, and I tried to swallow it away. &#34;I guess you know</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">that we're coming down to it now. Another couple of days.&#34;</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">He said nothing, only sat there holding my hands in his. I think, looking back on it, that something had</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">already begun to happen to me, but I was too fixed - mentally and emotionally - on doing my duty to</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="57" height="19" font="3">notice.</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is there anything special you'd like that night for dinner, John ? We can rustle you up most anything.</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="687" height="19" font="3">Even bring you a beer, if you want. just have to put her in a coffee cup, that's all.&#34;</text>
<text top="635" left="15" width="250" height="19" font="3">&#34;Never got the taste&#34;, he said.</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="279" height="19" font="3">&#34;Something special to eat, then?&#34;</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">His brow creased below that expanse of clean brown skull. Then the lines smoothed out and he smiled.</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="185" height="19" font="3">&#34;Meatloaf'd be good.&#34;</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;Meatloaf it is. With gravy and mashed.&#34; I felt a tingle like you get in your arm when you've slept on it,</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">except this one was all over my body. <i>In</i> my body. &#34;What else to go with it?&#34;</text>
<text top="839" left="15" width="622" height="19" font="3">&#34;Dunno, boss. Whatever you got, I guess. Okra, maybe, but I's not picky.&#34;</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right&#34;, I said, and thought he would also have Mrs. Janice Edgecombe's peach cobbler for dessert.</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Now, what about a preacher? Someone you could say a little prayer with, night after next? It comforts a</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">man, so I've seen that many times. I could get in touch with Reverend Schuster, he's the man who came</text>
<text top="950" left="15" width="107" height="19" font="3">when Del - &#34;</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't want no preacher&#34;, John said. &#34;You been good to me, boss. You can say a prayer, if you want.</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="551" height="19" font="3">That'd be all right. I could get kneebound with you a bit, I guess.&#34;</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="210" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Me! John</i> , I couldn't - &#34;</text>
<text top="1091" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">He pressed down on my hands a little, and that feeling got stronger. &#34;You <i>could,&#34;</i> he said. &#34;Couldn't you,</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;I suppose so&#34;, I heard myself say. My voice seemed to have developed an echo. &#34;I suppose I could, if it</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="116" height="19" font="3">came to that.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">The feeling was strong inside me by then, and it was like before, when he'd cured my waterworks, but it</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">was different, too. And not just because there was nothing wrong with me this time. It was different</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">because <i>this time he didn't know he was doing it.</i> Suddenly I was terrified, almost choked with a need to</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">get out of there. Lights were going on inside me where there had never been lights before. Not just in my</text>

<text top="296" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I tried to speak and couldn't. He could, though. What he said next was the longest I ever heard him speak.</text>

<text top="431" left="15" width="291" height="19" font="3">could end it, I would. But I cain't.&#34;</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Stop it, I tried to say. Stop it, let go of my hands, I'm going to drown if you don't. Drown or explode.</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="706" height="19" font="3">&#34;You won't 'splode,&#34; he said, smiling a little at the idea ... but he let go of my hands.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">I leaned forward, gasping. Between my knees I could see every crack in the cement floor, every groove,</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">every flash of mica. I looked up at the wall and saw names that had been written there in 1924, 1926,</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">1931. Those names had been washed away, the men who had written them had also been washed away,</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">in a manner of speaking, but I guess you can never wash anything completely away, not from this dark</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">glass of a world, and now I saw them again, a tangle of names overlying one another, and looking at</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">them was like listening to the dead speak and sing and cry out for mercy. I felt my eyeballs pulsing in</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">their sockets, heard my own heart, felt the windy whoosh of my blood rushing through all the boulevards</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="435" height="19" font="3">of my body like letters being mailed to everywhere.</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">I heard a train-whistle in the distance - the threefifty to Priceford, I imagine, but I couldn't be sure,</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">because I'd never heard it before. Not from Cold Mountain, I hadn't, because the closest it came to the</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">state pen was ten miles east. I <i>couldn't</i> have heard it from the pen, so you would have said and so, until</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="534" height="19" font="3">November of '32, I would have believed, but I heard it that day.</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="419" height="19" font="3">Somewhere a lightbulb shattered, loud as a bomb.</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="583" height="19" font="3">&#34;What did you do to me?&#34; I whispered. &#34;Oh John , what did you do?&#34;</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm sorry, boss,&#34; he said in his calm way. &#34;I wasn't thinkin. Ain't much, I reckon. You feel like regular</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="53" height="19" font="3">soon.&#34;</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">I got up and went to the cell door. It felt like walking in a dream. When I got there, he said: &#34;You wonder</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">why they didn't scream. That's the only thing you still wonder about, ain't it? Why those two little girls</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="459" height="19" font="3">didn't scream while they were still there on the porch.&#34;</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">I turned and looked at him. I could see every red snap in his eyes, I could see every pore on his face...</text>
</page>
<page number="201" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">and I could feel his hurt, the pain that he took in from other people like a sponge takes in water. I could</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">see the darkness he had spoken of, too. It lay in all the spaces of the world as he saw it, and in that</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">moment I felt both pity for him and great relief. Yes, it was a terrible thing we'd be doing, nothing would</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="498" height="19" font="3">ever change that ... and yet we would be doing him a favor.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;I seen it when that bad fella, he done grab me,&#34; John said. &#34;That's when I knowed it was him done it. I</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="753" height="19" font="3">seen him that day, I was in the trees and I seen him drop them down and run away, but - &#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="172" height="19" font="3">&#34;You forgot,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right, boss. Until he touch me, I forgot.&#34;</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">&#34;Why <i>didn't</i> they scream, John ? He hurt them enough to make them bleed, their parents were right</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="312" height="19" font="3">upstairs, so why didn't they scream?&#34;</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">John looked at me from his haunted eyes. &#34;He say to the one, 'If you make noise, it's your sister I kill, not</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="386" height="19" font="3">you', He say that same to the other. You see?&#34;</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes&#34;, I whispered, and I <i>could</i> see it. The Detterick porch in the dark. Wharton leaning over them like a</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">ghoul. One of them had maybe started to cry out, so Wharton had hit her and she had bled from the nose.</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="330" height="19" font="3">That's where most of it had come from.</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="755" height="19" font="3">&#34;He kill them with they love&#34;, John said. &#34;They love for each other. You see how it was?&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="255" height="19" font="3">I nodded, incapable of speech.</text>
<text top="578" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">He smiled. The tears were flowing again, but he smiled. &#34;That's how it is every day&#34;, he said, &#34;all over</text>
<text top="602" left="15" width="507" height="19" font="3">the worl'.&#34; Then he lay down and turned his face to the wall.</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I stepped out into the Mile, locked his cell, and walked up to the duty desk. I still felt like a man in a</text>
<text top="665" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">dream. I realized I could hear Brutal's thoughts - a very faint whisper, how to spell some word, <i>receive,</i> I</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">think it was. He was thinking <i>i before</i> e, <i>except after c, is that how the dadratted thing goes?</i> Then he</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">looked up, started to smile, and stopped when he got a good look at me. &#34;Paul?&#34; he asked. &#34;Are you all</text>
<text top="737" left="15" width="58" height="19" font="3">right?&#34;</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes.&#34; Then I told him what John had told me - not all of it, and certainly not about what his touch had</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">done to me (I never told anyone that part, not even Janice; Elaine Connelly will be the first to know of it</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">- if, that is, she wants to read these last pages after reading all the rest of them), but I repeated what John</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">had said about wanting to go. That seemed to relieve Brutal - a bit, anyway - but I sensed (heard?) him</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">wondering if I hadn't made it up, just to set his mind at ease. Then I felt him deciding to believe it, simply</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="608" height="19" font="3">because it would make things a little easier for him when the time came.</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="676" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul, is that infection of yours coming back?&#34; he asked. &#34;You look all flushed.&#34;</text>
<text top="974" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">&#34;No, I think I'm okay&#34;, I said. I wasn't, but I felt sure by then that John was right and I was going to be. I</text>
<text top="998" left="15" width="337" height="19" font="3">could feel that tingle starting to subside.</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="710" height="19" font="3">&#34;All the same, it might not hurt you to go on in your office there and lie down a bit.&#34;</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Lying down was the <i>last</i> thing I felt like right then - the idea seemed so ridiculous that I almost laughed.</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">What I felt like doing was maybe building myself a little house, then shingling it, and plowing a garden</text>

<page number="202" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="393" height="19" font="3">in back, and planting it. All before suppertime.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="769" height="19" font="4"><i>That's how it is, I</i> thought. <i>Every day. All over the world. That darkness. All over the world.</i></text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="726" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm going to take a turn over to Admin instead. Got a few things to check over there.&#34;</text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="130" height="19" font="3">&#34;If you say so.&#34;</text>
<text top="191" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">I went to the door and opened it, then looked back. &#34;You've got it right&#34;, I said: &#34;r-e-c-e-i-v-e; i before <i>e,</i></text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="709" height="19" font="3">except after c. Most of the time, anyway; I guess there's exceptions to all the rules.-&#34;</text>
<text top="254" left="15" width="743" height="19" font="3">I went out, not needing to look back at him to know he was staring with his mouth open.</text>
<text top="293" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">I kept moving for the rest of that shift, unable to sit down for more than five minutes at a stretch before</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">jumping up again. I went over to Admin, and then I tromped back and forth across the empty exercise</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">yard until the guards in the towers must have thought I was crazy. But by the time my shift was over, I</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">was starting to calm down again, and that rustle of thoughts in my head -like a stirring of leaves, it was -</text>
<text top="389" left="15" width="261" height="19" font="3">had pretty much quieted down.</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">Still, halfway home that morning, it came back strong. The way my urinary infection had. I had to park</text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">my Ford by the side of the road, get out, and sprint nearly half a mile, head down, arms pumping, breath</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">tearing in and out of my throat as warm as something that you've carried in your armpit. Then, at last, I</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">began to feel really normal. I trotted halfway back to where the Ford was parked and walked the rest of</text>
<text top="524" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">the way, my breath steaming in the chilly air. When I got home, I told Janice that John Coffey had said</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">he was ready, that he wanted to go. She nodded, looking relieved. Was she really? I couldn't say. Six</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">hours before, even three, I would have known, but by then I didn't. And that was good. John had kept</text>
<text top="596" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">saying that he was tired, and now I could understand why. It would have tired anyone out, what he had.</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="444" height="19" font="3">Would have made anyone long for rest and for quiet.</text>
<text top="659" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">When Janice asked me why I looked so flushed and smelled so sweaty, I told her I had stopped the car on</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">my way home and gone running for awhile, running hard. I told her that much - as I may have said</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">(there's too many pages here now for me to want to look back through and make sure), lying wasn't much</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="403" height="19" font="3">a part of our marriage - but I didn't tell her why.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">And she didn't ask.</text>
<text top="809" left="15" width="16" height="19" font="2"><b>9.</b></text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">There were no thunderstorms on the night it came John Coffey's turn to walk the Green Mile. It was</text>
<text top="872" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">seasonably cold for those parts at that time of year, in the thirties, I'd guess, and a million stars spilled</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">across used-up, picked-out fields where frost glittered on fenceposts and glowed like diamonds on the</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="234" height="19" font="3">dry skeletons of July's corn.</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">Brutus Howell was out front for this one - he would do the capping and tell Van Hay to roll when it was</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">time. Bill Dodge was in with Van Hay. And at around eleven-twenty on the night of November 20th,</text>
<text top="1007" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Dean and Harry and I went down to our one occupied cell, where John Coffey sat on the end of his bunk</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">with his hands clasped between his knees and a tiny dab of meatloaf gravy on the collar of his blue shirt.</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">He looked out through the bars at us, a lot calmer than we felt, it seemed. My hands were cold and my</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">temples were throbbing. It was one thing to know he was willing - it made it at least possible for us to do</text>
<text top="1103" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">our job - but it was another to know we were going to electrocute him for someone else's crime.</text>
</page>
<page number="203" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="41" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">I had last seen Hal Moores around seven that evening. He was in his office, buttoning up his overcoat.</text>
<text top="65" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">His face was pale, his hands shaking so badly that he was making quite some production of those</text>
<text top="89" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">buttons. I almost wanted to knock his fingers aside and do the coat up myself, like you would with a little</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">kid. The irony was that Melinda had looked better when Jan and I went to see her the previous weekend</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="539" height="19" font="3">than Hal had looked earlier on John Coffey's execution evening.</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">&#34;I won't be staying for this one,&#34; he had said. &#34;Curtis will be there, and I know Coffey will be in good</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="239" height="19" font="3">hands with you and Brutus.&#34;</text>
<text top="239" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, sir, we'll do our best&#34;, I said. &#34;Is there any word on Percy?&#34; Is he coming back around? is what I</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">meant, of course. Is he even now sitting in a room somewhere and telling someone - some doctor, most</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">likely - about how we zipped him into the nut-coat and threw him into the restraint room like any other</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="780" height="19" font="3">problem child ... any other lugoon, in Percy's language? And if he is, are they believing him?</text>
<text top="350" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">But according to Hal, Percy was just the same. Not talking, and not, so far as anyone could tell, in the</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">world at all. He was still at Indianola - &#34;being evaluated&#34;, Hal had said, looking mystified at the phrase -</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="558" height="19" font="3">but if there was no improvement, he would be moving along soon.</text>
<text top="437" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;How's Coffey holding up?&#34; Hal had asked then. He had finally managed to do up the last button of his</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="40" height="19" font="3">coat.</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="287" height="19" font="3">I nodded. &#34;He'll be fine, Warden.&#34;</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">He'd nodded back, then gone to the door, looking old and ill. &#34;How can so much good and so much evil</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">live together in the same man? How could the man who cured my wife be the same man who killed those</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="310" height="19" font="3">little girls? Do you understand that?&#34;</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I had told him I didn't, the ways of God were mysterious, there was good and evil in all of us, ours not to</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">reason why, -hotcha, hotcha, row-dee-dow. Most of what I told him were things I'd learned in the church</text>
<text top="674" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">of Praise Jesus, The Lord Is Mighty, Hal nodding the whole time and looking sort of exalted. He could</text>
<text top="698" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">afford to nod, couldn't he? Yes. And look exalted, too. There was a deep sadness on his face - he was</text>
<text top="722" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">shaken, all right; I never doubted it - but there were no tears this time, because he had a wife to go home</text>
<text top="746" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">to, his companion to go home to, and she was fine. Thanks to John Coffey, she was well and fine and the</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">man who had signed John 's death warrant could leave and go to her. He didn't have to watch what came</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">next. He would be able to sleep that night in his wife's warmth while John Coffey lay on a slab in the</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">basement of County Hospital, growing cool as the friendless, speechless hours moved toward dawn. And</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I hated Hal for those things. Just a little, and I'd get over it, but it was hate, all right. The genuine article.</text>
<text top="881" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">Now I stepped into the cell, followed by Dean and Harry, both of them pale and downcast. &#34;Are you</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="191" height="19" font="3">ready, John ?&#34; I asked.</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="291" height="19" font="3">He nodded. &#34;Yes, boss. Guess so.&#34;</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="456" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right, then. I got a piece to say before we go out.&#34;</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="289" height="19" font="3">&#34;You say what you need to, boss.&#34;</text>
<text top="1061" left="15" width="352" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey, as an officer of the court...&#34;</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I said it right to the end, and when I'd finished, Harry Terwilliger stepped up beside me and held out his</text>

<page number="204" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">hand. John looked surprised for a moment, then smiled and shook it. Dean, looking paler than ever,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="715" height="19" font="3">offered his next. &#34;You deserve better than this, Johnny&#34; he said hoarsely. &#34;I'm sorry.&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="825" height="19" font="3">&#34;I be all right&#34;, John said. &#34;This the hard part; I be all right in a little while.&#34; He got up, and the St.</text>

<text top="161" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;John, I ought to have that&#34;, I said. &#34;I can put it back on you after the... after, if you want, but I should</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">take it for now.&#34; It was silver, and if it was lying against his skin when Jack Van Hay switched on the</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">juice, it might fuse itself into his skin. Even if it didn't do that, it was apt to electroplate, leaving a kind of</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">charred photograph of itself on the skin of his chest. I had seen it before. I'd seen most everything during</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="573" height="19" font="3">my years on the Mile. More than was good for me. I knew that now.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">He slipped the chain over his head and put it in my hand. I put the medallion in my pocket and told him</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">to step on out of the cell. There was no need to check his head and make sure the contact would be firm</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="551" height="19" font="3">and the induction good; it was as smooth as the palm of my hand.</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and had a dream, boss&#34;, he said. &#34;I dreamed about Del's mouse.&#34;</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">&#34;Did you, John ?&#34; I flanked him on the left. Harry took the right. Dean fell in behind, and then we were</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="712" height="19" font="3">walking the Green Mile. For me, it was the last time I ever walked it with a prisoner.</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yep&#34;, he said. &#34;I dreamed he got down to that place Boss Howell talked about, that Mouseville place. I</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">dreamed there was kids, and how they laughed at his tricks! My!&#34; He laughed himself at the thought of it,</text>
<text top="533" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">then grew serious again. &#34;I dreamed those two little blond-headed girls were there. They us laughin, too.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">I put my arms around em and there us no blood comin out they hair and they 'us fine. We all watch Mr.</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="557" height="19" font="3">Jingles roll that spool, and how we did laugh. Fit to bus', we was.&#34;</text>
<text top="620" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is that so?&#34; I was thinking I couldn't go through with it, just could not, there was no way. I was going to</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="748" height="19" font="3">cry or scream or maybe my heart would burst with sorrow and that would be an end to it.</text>
<text top="683" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">We went into my office. John looked around for a moment or two, then dropped to his knees without</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">having to be asked. Behind him, Harry was looking at me with haunted eyes. Dean was as white as</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="52" height="19" font="3">paper.</text>
<text top="770" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">I got down on my knees with John and thought there was a funny turnaround brewing here: after all the</text>
<text top="794" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">prisoners I'd had to help up so they could finish the journey, this time I was the one who was apt to need</text>
<text top="818" left="15" width="319" height="19" font="3">a hand. That's the way it felt, anyway.</text>
<text top="857" left="15" width="386" height="19" font="3">&#34;What should we pray for, boss?&#34; John asked.</text>
<text top="896" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">&#34;Strength&#34;, I said without even thinking. I closed my eyes and said, &#34;Lord God of 'Hosts, please help us</text>
<text top="920" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">finish what we've started, and please welcome this man, John Coffey - like the drink but not spelled the</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">same - into heaven and give him peace. Please help us to see him off the way he deserves and let nothing</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">go wrong. Amen.&#34; I opened my eyes and looked at Dean and Harry. Both of them looked a little better.</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="731" height="19" font="3">Probably it was having a few moments to catch their breath. I doubt it was my praying.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">I started to get up, and John caught my arm. He gave me a look that was both timid and hopeful. &#34;I</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="835" height="19" font="3">'member a prayer someone taught me when I 'us little&#34;, he said. &#34;At least I think I do. Can I say it?&#34;</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="560" height="19" font="3">&#34;You go right on and do her&#34;, Dean said. &#34;Lots of time yet, John .&#34;</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">John closed his eyes and frowned with concentration. I expected now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep, or maybe</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">a garbled version of the Lord's prayer, but I got neither; I had never heard what he came out with before,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">and have never heard it again, not that either the sentiments or expressions were particularly unusual.</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">Holding his hands up in front of his closed eyes, John Coffey said: &#34;Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray for</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">me, an orphan child. Be my strength, be my friend, be with me until the end. Amen.&#34; He opened his eyes,</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="365" height="19" font="3">started to get up, then looked at me closely.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">I wipe my arm across my eyes. As I listened to him, I had been thinking about Del; he had wanted to</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">pray one more at the end, too. Holy Mary, <i>mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our</i></text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="182" height="19" font="4"><i>death.</i> &#34;Sorry, John .&#34;</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't be&#34;, he said. He squeezed my arm and smiled. And then, as I'd thought he might have to do, he</text>
<text top="305" left="15" width="183" height="19" font="3">helped me to my feet.</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="26" height="19" font="2"><b>10.</b></text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">There weren't many witnesses - maybe fourteen in all, half the number that had been in the storage room</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">for the Delacroix execution. Homer Cribus was there, overflowing his chair as per usual, but I didn't see</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="747" height="19" font="3">Deputy McGee. Like Warden Moores, he had apparently decided to give this one a miss.</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">Sitting in the front row was an elderly couple I didn't recognize at first, even though I had seen their</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">pictures in a good many newspaper articles by that day in the third week of November. Then, as we</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">neared the platform where Old Sparky waited, the woman spat, &#34;Die slow, you son of a bitch!&#34; and I</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">realized they were the Dettericks, Klaus and Marjorie. I hadn't recognized them because you don't often</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="529" height="19" font="3">see elderly people who haven't yet climbed out of their thirties.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">John hunched his shoulders at the sound of the woman's voice and Sheriff Cribus's grunt of approval.</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Hank Bitterman, who had the guard-post near the front of the meager group of spectators, never took his</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">eyes off Klaus Detterick. That was per my orders, but Detterick never made a move in John 's direction</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="470" height="19" font="3">that night. Detterick seemed to be on some other planet.</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">Brutal, standing beside Old Sparky, gave me a small finger-tilt as we stepped up onto the platform. He</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">holstered his sidearm and took John 's wrist, escorting him toward the electric chair as gently as a boy</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="554" height="19" font="3">leading his date out onto the floor for their first dance as a couple.</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="453" height="19" font="3">&#34;Everything all right, John ?&#34; he asked in a low voice.</text>
<text top="842" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, boss, but. . .&#34; His eyes were moving from side to side in their sockets, and for the first time he</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">looked and sounded scared. &#34;But they's a lot of folks here hate me. A <i>lot. I</i> can feel it. Hurts. Bores in like</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="178" height="19" font="3">bee-stings an, <i>hurts.&#34;</i></text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">&#34;Feel how we feel, then,&#34; Brutal said in that same low voice. <i>&#34;We </i>don't hate you - can you feel that?&#34;</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, boss.&#34; But his voice was trembling worse now, and his eyes had begun to leak their slow tears</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="51" height="19" font="3">again.</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Kill him twice, you boys!&#34;</i> Marjorie Detterick suddenly screamed. Her ragged, strident voice was like a</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">slap. John cringed against me and moaned. &#34;You <i>go on and kill that raping baby-killer twice, that'd be</i></text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="83" height="19" font="4"><i>just fine!&#34;</i></text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="822" height="19" font="3">Klaus, still looking like a man dreaming awake, pulled her against his shoulder. She began to sob.</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">I saw with dismay that Harry Terwilliger was crying, too. So far none of the spectators had seen his tears</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">- his back was to them - but he was crying, all right. Still, what could we do? Besides push on with it, I</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="55" height="19" font="3">mean?</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Brutal and I turned John around. Brutal pressed on one of the big man's shoulders and John sat. He</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">gripped Sparky's wide oak arms, his eyes moving from side to side, his tongue darting out to wet first one</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="296" height="19" font="3">corner of his mouth, then the other.</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">Harry and I dropped to our knees. The day before, we'd had one of the shop-trusties weld temporary</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">flexible extensions to the chair's ankle clamps, because John Coffey's ankles were nigh on the size of an</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">ordinary fellow's calves. Still, I had a nightmarish moment when I thought they were still going to come</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">up small, and we'd have to take him back to his cell while Sam Broderick, who was head of the shop</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">guys in those days, was found and tinkered some more. I gave a final, extra-hard shove with the heels of</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="809" height="19" font="3">my hands and the clamp on my side closed. John 's leg jerked and he gasped. I had pinched him.</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sorry, John ,&#34; I murmured, and glanced at Harry. He had gotten his clamp fixed more easily (either the</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">extension on his side was a little bigger or John 's right calf was a little smaller), but he was looking at</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">the result with a doubtful expression. I guessed I could understand why; the modified clamps had a</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="583" height="19" font="3">hungry look, their jaws seeming to gape like the mouths of alligators.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">&#34;It'll be all right&#34;, I said, hoping that I sounded convincing ... and that I was telling the truth. &#34;Wipe your</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="108" height="19" font="3">face, Harry.&#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">He swabbed at it with his arm, wiping away tears from his cheeks and beads of sweat from his forehead.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="790" height="19" font="3">We turned. Homer Cribus, who had been talking too loudly to the man sitting next to him (the</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="755" height="19" font="3">prosecutor, judging from the string tie and rusty black suit), fell silent. It was almost time.</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">Brutal had clamped one of John 's wrists, Dean the other. Over Dean's shoulder I could see the doctor,</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">unobtrusive as ever, standing against the wall with his black bag between his feet. Nowadays I guess they</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">just about run such affairs, especially the ones with the IV drips, but back then you almost had to yank</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">them forward if you wanted them. Maybe back then they had a clearer idea of what was right for a doctor</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">to be doing, and what was a perversion of the special promise they make, the one where they swear first</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="171" height="19" font="3">of all to do no harm.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Dean nodded to Brutal. Brutal turned his head, seemed to glance at the telephone that was never going to</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="644" height="19" font="3">ring for the likes of John Coffey, and called &#34;Roll on one!&#34; to Jack Van Hay.</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">There was that hum, like an old fridge kicking on, and the lights burned a little brighter. Our shadows</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">stood out a little sharper, black shapes that climbed the wall and seemed to hover around the shadow of</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="647" height="19" font="3">the chair like vultures. John drew in a sharp breath. His knuckles were white.</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Does it hurt yet?&#34;</i> Mrs. Detterick shrieked brokenly from against her husband's shoulder.&#34;I <i>hope it does!</i></text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="4"><i>I hope it hurts like hell!&#34;</i> Her husband squeezed her. One side of his nose was bleeding, I saw, a narrow</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="828" height="19" font="3">trickle of red working its way down into his narrow-gauge mustache. When I opened the paper the</text>
<text top="1049" left="15" width="774" height="19" font="3">following March and saw he'd died of a stroke, I was about the least surprised man on earth.</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Brutal stepped into John 's field of vision. He touched John 's shoulder as he spoke. That was irregular,</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">but of the witnesses, only Curtis Anderson knew it, and he did not seem to remark it. I thought he looked</text>
</page>
<page number="207" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">like a man who only wants to be done with his current job. Desperately wants to be done with it. He</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">enlisted in the Army after Pearl Harbor, but never got overseas; he died at Fort Bragg, in a truck accident.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">John, meanwhile, relaxed beneath Brutal's fingers. I don't think he understood much, if any, of what</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">Brutal was telling him, but he took comfort from Brutal's hand on his shoulder. Brutal, who died of a</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="840" height="19" font="3">heart attack about twenty-five years later (he was eating a fish sandwich and watching TV wrestling</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">when it happened, his sister said), was a good man. My friend. Maybe the best of us. He had no trouble</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="758" height="19" font="3">understanding how a man could simultaneously want to go and still be terrified of the trip.</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey, you have been condemned to die in the electric chair, sentence passed by a jury of your</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">peers and imposed by a judge of good standing in this state. God save the people of this state. Do you</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="442" height="19" font="3">have anything to say before sentence is carried out?&#34;</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="677" height="19" font="3">John wet his lips again, then spoke clearly. Six words. &#34;I'm sorry for what I am.&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;You ought to be!&#34;</i> the mother of the two dead girls screamed. <i>&#34;Oh you monster, you ought to be! YOU</i></text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="275" height="19" font="4"><i>DAMN WELL OUGHT TO BE!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">John's eyes turned to me. I saw no resignation in them, no hope of heaven, no dawning peace. How I</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">would love to tell you that I did. How I would love to tell myself that. What I saw was fear, misery,</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">incompletion, and incomprehension. They were the eyes of a trapped and terrified animal. I thought of</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">what he'd said about how Wharton had gotten Cora and Kathe Detterick off the porch without rousing the</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="677" height="19" font="3">house: <i>He kill them with they love. That's how it is every day. All over the world.</i></text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">Brutal took the new mask from its brass hook on the back of the chair, but as soon as John saw it and</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">understood what it was, his eyes widened in horror. He looked at me, and now I could see huge droplets</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="750" height="19" font="3">of sweat standing out on the curve of his naked skull. As big as robin's eggs, they looked.</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Please, boss, don't put that thing over my face,&#34; he said in a moaning little whisper. &#34;Please don't put me</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="554" height="19" font="3">in the dark, don't make me go into the dark, I's afraid of the dark.&#34;</text>
<text top="707" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">Brutal was looking at me, eyebrows raised, frozen in place, the mask in his hands. His eyes said it was</text>
<text top="731" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">my call, he'd go either way. I thought as fast as I could and as well as I could -hard to do, with my head</text>
<text top="755" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">pounding the way it was. The mask was tradition, not law. It was, in fact, to spare the witnesses. And</text>
<text top="779" left="15" width="823" height="19" font="3">suddenly I decided that they did not need to be spared, not this once. John , after all, hadn't done a</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">damned thing in his life to warrant dying under a mask. They didn't know that, but we did, and I decided</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I was going to grant this last request. As for Marjorie Detterick, she'd probably send me a thank-you</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="41" height="19" font="3">note.</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="260" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right, John ,&#34; I murmured.</text>
<text top="929" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">Brutal put the mask back. From behind us, Homer Cribus called out indignantly in his deep-dish cracker</text>
<text top="953" left="15" width="701" height="19" font="3">voice: &#34;Say, boy! Put that-air mask on him! Think we want to watch his eyes pop?&#34;</text>
<text top="992" left="15" width="765" height="19" font="3">&#34;Be quiet, sir,&#34; I said without turning. &#34;This is an execution, and you're not in charge of it.&#34;</text>
<text top="1031" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Any more than you were in charge of catching him, you tub of guts,&#34; Harry whispered. Harry died in</text>
<text top="1055" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">1982, close to the age of eighty. An old man. Not in my league, of course, but few are. It was intestinal</text>
<text top="1079" left="15" width="175" height="19" font="3">cancer of some kind.</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Brutal bent over and plucked the disk of sponge out of its bucket. He pressed a finger into it and licked</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">the tip, but he hardly had to; I could see the ugly brown thing dripping. He tucked it into the cap, then put</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">the cap on John 's head. For the first time I saw that Brutal was pale, too - pasty white, on the verge of</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">passing out. I thought of him saying that he felt, for the first time in his life, that he was in danger of hell,</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">because we were fixing to kill a gift of God. I felt a sudden strong need to retch. I controlled it, but only</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="693" height="19" font="3">with an effort. Water from the sponge was dripping down the sides of John 's face.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Dean Stanton ran the strap - let out to its maximum length on this occasion - across John 's chest and</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">gave it to me. We had taken such pains to try and protect Dean on the night of our trip, because of his</text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">kids, never knowing that he had less than four months to live. After John Coffey, he requested and</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">received a transfer away from Old Sparky, over to C Block, and there a prisoner stabbed him in the throat</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">with a shank and let out his life's blood on the dirty board floor. I never knew why. I don't think anyone</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">ever knew why. Old Sparky seems such a thing of perversity when I look back on those days, such a</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">deadly bit of folly. Fragile as blown glass, we are, even under the best of conditions. To kill each other</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="551" height="19" font="3">with gas and electricity, and in cold blood? The folly. The horror.</text>
<text top="401" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">Brutal checked the strap, then stood back. I waited for him to speak, but he didn't. As he crossed his</text>
<text top="425" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">hands behind his back and stood at parade rest, I knew that he wouldn't. Perhaps couldn't. I didn't think I</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">could, either, but then I looked at John 's terrified, weeping eyes and knew I had to. Even if it damned me</text>
<text top="473" left="15" width="141" height="19" font="3">forever, I had to.</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="663" height="19" font="3">&#34;Roll on two,&#34; I said in a dusty, cracking voice I hardly recognized as my own.</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">The cap hummed. Eight large fingers and two large thumbs rose from the ends of the chair's broad oak</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="815" height="19" font="3">arms and splayed tensely in ten different directions, their tips jittering. His big knees made caged</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">pistoning motions, but the clamps on his ankles held. Overhead, three of the hanging lights blew out -</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">Pow! Pow! Pow! Marjorie Detterick screamed at the sound and fainted in her husband's arms. She died in</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="700" height="19" font="3">Memphis, eighteen years later. Harry sent me the obit. It was a trolley-car accident.</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">John surged forward against the chest-strap. For a moment his eyes met mine. They were aware; I was</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">the last thing he saw as we tilted him off the edge of the world. Then he fell against the seatback, the cap</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">coming askew on his head a little, smoke - a sort of charry mist - drifting out from beneath it. But on the</text>
<text top="758" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">whole, you know, it was quick. I doubt if it was painless, the way the chair's supporters always claim (it's</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">not an idea even the most rabid of them ever seems to want to investigate personally), but it was quick.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">The hands were limp again, the formerly bluish-white moons at the base of the fingernails now a deep</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">eggplant hue, a tendril of smoke rising off cheeks still wet with salt water from the sponge ... and his</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="45" height="19" font="3">tears.</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="200" height="19" font="3">John Coffey's last tears.</text>
<text top="932" left="15" width="26" height="19" font="2"><b>11.</b></text>
<text top="971" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">I was all right until I got home. It was dawn by then, and birds singing. I parked my flivver, I got out, I</text>
<text top="995" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">walked up the back steps, and then the second greatest grief I have ever known washed over me. It was</text>
<text top="1019" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">thinking of how he'd been afraid of the dark that did it. I remembered the first time we'd met, how he'd</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">asked if we left a light on at night, and my legs gave out on me. I sat on my steps and hung my head over</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="782" height="19" font="3">my knees and cried. It didn't feel like that weeping was just for John , either, but for all of us.</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="643" height="19" font="3">Janice came out and sat down beside me. She put an arm over my shoulders.</text>

<text top="44" left="15" width="521" height="19" font="3">&#34;You didn't hurt him any more than you could help, did you?&#34;</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="171" height="19" font="3">I shook my head no.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="197" height="19" font="3">&#34;And he wanted to go.&#34;</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="79" height="19" font="3">I nodded.</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Come in the house,&#34; she said, helping me up. It made me think of the way John had helped me up after</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="418" height="19" font="3">we'd prayed together. &#34;Come in and have coffee.&#34;</text>
<text top="263" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">I did. The first morning passed, and the first afternoon, then the first shift back at work. Time takes it all,</text>
<text top="287" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">whether you want it to or not. Time takes it all, time bears it away, and in the end there is only darkness.</text>
<text top="311" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Sometimes we find others in that darkness, and sometimes we lose them there again. That's all I know,</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="751" height="19" font="3">except that this happened in 1932, when the state penitentiary was still at Cold Mountain.</text>
<text top="374" left="15" width="275" height="19" font="3">And the electric chair, of course.</text>
<text top="413" left="15" width="26" height="19" font="2"><b>12.</b></text>
<text top="452" left="15" width="834" height="19" font="3">A round quarter past two in the afternoon, my friend Elaine Connelly came to me where I sat in the</text>
<text top="476" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">sunroom, with the last pages of my story squared up neatly in front of me. Her face was very pale, and</text>
<text top="500" left="15" width="568" height="19" font="3">there were shiny places under her eyes. I think she had been crying.</text>
<text top="539" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">Me, I'd been looking. Just that. Looking out the window and over the hills to the east, my right hand</text>
<text top="563" left="15" width="827" height="19" font="3">throbbing at the end of its wrist. But it was a peaceful throb, somehow. I felt empty, husked out. A</text>
<text top="587" left="15" width="474" height="19" font="3">feeling that was terrible and wonderful at the same time.</text>
<text top="626" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">It was hard to meet Elaine's eyes - l was afraid of the hate and contempt I might see there - but they were</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="688" height="19" font="3">all right. Sad and wondering, but all right. No hate, no contempt, and no disbelief.</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="3">&#34;Do you want the rest of the story?&#34; I asked. I tapped the little pile of script with my aching hand.</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's here, but I'll understand if you'd just as soon not - &#34;</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">&#34;It isn't a question of what I <i>want&#34;,</i> she said. &#34;I have to know how it came out, although I guess there is</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">no doubt that you executed him. The intervention of Providence-with-a-capital-P is greatly overrated in</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="654" height="19" font="3">the lives of ordinary humans, I think. But before I take those pages ... Paul ...&#34;</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">She stopped, as if unsure how to go on. I waited. Sometimes you can't help people. Sometimes it's better</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="127" height="19" font="3">not even to try.</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="851" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul, you speak in here as though you had two grown children in 1932 - not just one, but <i>two.</i> If you</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">didn't get married to your Janice when you were twelve and she was eleven, something like that - &#34;</text>
<text top="980" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">I smiled a little. &#34;We were young when we married - a lot of hill-people are, my own mother was - but</text>
<text top="1004" left="15" width="136" height="19" font="3">not <i>that</i> young.&#34;</text>
<text top="1043" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">&#34;Then how old <i>are you?</i> I've always assumed you were in your early eighties, my age, possibly even a</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="319" height="19" font="3">little younger, but according to this...&#34;</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;I was forty the year John walked the Green Mile&#34;, I said. &#34;I was born in 1892. That makes me a hundred</text>

<page number="210" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="313" height="19" font="3">and four, unless my reckoning's out.&#34;</text>
<text top="74" left="15" width="243" height="19" font="3">She stared at me, speechless.</text>
<text top="113" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">I held out the rest of the manuscript, remembering again how John had touched me, there in his cell.</text>
<text top="152" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="4"><i>You won't 'splode,</i> he'd said, smiling a bit at the very idea, and I hadn't ... but something had happened to</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="305" height="19" font="3">me, all the same. Something lasting.</text>
<text top="215" left="15" width="531" height="19" font="3">&#34;Read the rest of it&#34;, I said. &#34;What answers I have are in there.&#34;</text>
<text top="254" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right&#34;, she almost whispered. &#34;I'm a little afraid to, I can't lie about that, but ... all right. Where will</text>
<text top="278" left="15" width="74" height="19" font="3">you be?&#34;</text>
<text top="317" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I stood up, stretched, listened to my spine crackle in my back. One thing that I knew for sure was that I</text>
<text top="341" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">was sick to death of the sunroom. &#34;Out on the croquet course. There's still something I want to show you,</text>
<text top="365" left="15" width="211" height="19" font="3">and it's in that direction.&#34;</text>
<text top="404" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Is it ... scary?&#34; In her timid look I saw the little girl she had been back when men wore straw boaters in</text>
<text top="428" left="15" width="371" height="19" font="3">the summer and raccoon coats in the winter.</text>
<text top="467" left="15" width="287" height="19" font="3">&#34;No&#34;, I said, smiling. &#34;Not scary.&#34;</text>
<text top="506" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right.&#34; She took the pages. &#34;I'm going to take these down to my room. I'll see you out on the croquet</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="679" height="19" font="3">course around...&#34; She riffled the manuscript, estimating. &#34;Four? Is that all right?&#34;</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="708" height="19" font="3">&#34;Perfect,&#34; I said, thinking of the too-curious Brad Dolan. He would be gone by then.</text>
<text top="608" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">She reached out, gave my arm a little squeeze, and left the room. I stood where I was for a moment,</text>
<text top="632" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">looking down at the table, taking in the fact that it was bare again except for the breakfast tray Elaine had</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">brought me that morning, my scattered papers at last gone. I somehow couldn't believe I was done ... and</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">as you can see, since all this was written after I recorded John Coffey's execution and gave the last batch</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="566" height="19" font="3">of pages to Elaine, I was not. And even then, part of me knew why.</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="81" height="19" font="3">Alabama.</text>
<text top="782" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">I filched the last piece of cold toast off the tray, went downstairs, and out onto the croquet course. There I</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">sat in the sun, watching half a dozen pairs and one slow but cheerful foursome pass by waving their</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="726" height="19" font="3">mallets, thinking my old man's thoughts and letting the sun warm my old man's bones.</text>
<text top="869" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">Around two-forty-five, the three-to-eleven shift started to trickle in from the parking lot, and at three, the</text>
<text top="893" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">day-shift folks left. Most were in groups, but Brad Dolan, I saw, was walking alone. That was sort of a</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">happy sight; maybe the world hasn't gone entirely to hell, after all. One of his joke-books was sticking</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">out of his back pocket. The path to the parking lot goes by the croquet course, so he saw me there, but he</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">didn't give me either a wave or a scowl. That was fine by me. He got into his old Chevrolet with the</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="809" height="19" font="3">bumper sticker reading I HAVE SEEN GOD AND HIS NAME IS NEWT. Then he was gone to</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="708" height="19" font="3">wherever he goes when he isn't here, laying a thin trail of discount motor oil behind.</text>
<text top="1052" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Around four o'clock, Elaine joined me, just as she had promised. From the look of her eyes, she'd done a</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">little more crying. She put her arms around me and hugged me tight. &#34;Poor John Coffey&#34;, she said. &#34;And</text>
<text top="1100" left="15" width="237" height="19" font="3">poor Paul Edgecombe, too.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="211" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="38" left="15" width="369" height="19" font="3">Poor Paul, I heard Jan saying. Poor old guy.</text>
<text top="77" left="15" width="830" height="19" font="3">Elaine began to cry again. I held her, there on the croquet course in the late sunshine. Our shadows</text>
<text top="101" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">looked as if they were dancing. Perhaps in the Make Believe Ballroom we used to listen to on the radio</text>
<text top="125" left="15" width="160" height="19" font="3">back in those days.</text>
<text top="164" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">At last she got herself under control and drew back from me. She found a Kleenex in her blouse pocket</text>
<text top="188" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">and wiped her streaming eyes with it. &#34;What happened to the Warden's wife, Paul? What happened with</text>
<text top="212" left="15" width="68" height="19" font="3">Melly?&#34;</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="857" height="19" font="3">&#34;She was considered the marvel of the age, at least by the doctors at Indianola Hospital,&#34; I said. I took</text>
<text top="275" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">her arm and we began to walk toward the path which led away from the employees, parking lot and into</text>
<text top="299" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">the woods. Toward the shed down by the wall between Georgia Pines and the world of younger people.</text>
<text top="323" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;She died - of a heart attack, not a brain tumor - ten or eleven years later. In forty-three, I think. Hal died</text>
<text top="347" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">of a stroke right around Pearl Harbor Day-could have been on Pearl Harbor Day, for all I remember - so</text>
<text top="371" left="15" width="389" height="19" font="3">she outlived him by two years. Sort of ironic.&#34;</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="120" height="19" font="3">&#34;And Janice?&#34;</text>
<text top="449" left="15" width="612" height="19" font="3">&#34;I'm not quite prepared for that today&#34;, I said. &#34;I'll tell you another time.&#34;</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="95" height="19" font="3">&#34;Promise?&#34;</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">&#34;Promise.&#34; But that was one I never kept. Three months after the day we walked down into the woods</text>
<text top="551" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">together (I would have held her hand, if I hadn't been afraid of hurting her bunched and swollen fingers),</text>
<text top="575" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">Elaine Connelly died quietly in her bed. As with Melinda Moores, death came as the result of a heart</text>
<text top="599" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">attack. The orderly who found her said she looked peaceful, as if it had come suddenly and without much</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">pain. I hope he was right about that. I loved Elaine. And I miss her. Her and Janice and Brutal and just all</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="70" height="19" font="3">of them.</text>
<text top="686" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">We reached the second shed on the path, the one down by the wall. It stood back in a bower of scrub</text>
<text top="710" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">pines, its sagging roof and boarded-over windows laced and dappled with shadows. I started toward it.</text>
<text top="734" left="15" width="376" height="19" font="3">Elaine hung back a moment, looking fearful.</text>
<text top="773" left="15" width="344" height="19" font="3">&#34;It's all right,&#34; I said. &#34;Really. Come on.&#34;</text>
<text top="812" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">There was no latch on the door - there had been once, but it had been torn away - and so I used a</text>
<text top="836" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">folded-over square of cardboard to wedge it shut. I pulled it free now, and stepped into the shed. I left the</text>
<text top="860" left="15" width="512" height="19" font="3">door as wide open as it would go, because it was dark inside.</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="576" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul, what? ... Oh. Oh!&#34; That second &#34;oh&#34; was just shy of a scream.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">There was a table pushed off to one side. On it was a flashlight and a brown paper bag. On the dirty floor</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">was a Hav-A-Tampa cigar box I'd gotten from the concession man who refills the home's soft-drink and</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">candy machines. I'd asked him for it special, and since his company also sells tobacco products, it was</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">easy for him to get. I offered to pay him for it - they were valuable commodities when I worked at Cold</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="526" height="19" font="3">Mountain, as I may have told you - but he just laughed me off.</text>
<text top="1073" left="15" width="553" height="19" font="3">Peering over the edge of it were a pair of bright little oilspot eyes.</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">&#34;Mr. Jingles,&#34; I said in a low voice. &#34;Come over here. Come on over here, old boy, and see this lady.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="212" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">I squatted down - it hurt, but I managed - and held out my hand. At first I didn't think he was going to be</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">able to get over the side of the box this time, but he made it with one final lunge. He landed on his side,</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="838" height="19" font="3">then regained his feet, and came over to me. He ran with a hitching limp in one of his back legs; the</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">injury that Percy had inflicted had come back in Mr. Jingles's old age. His old, old age. Except for the top</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="534" height="19" font="3">of his head and the tip of his tail, his fur had gone entirely gray.</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">He hopped onto the palm of my hand. I raised him up and he stretched his neck out, sniffing at my breath</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">with his ears laid back and his tiny dark eyes avid. I held my hand out toward Elaine, who looked at the</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="394" height="19" font="3">mouse with wide-eyed wonder, her lips parted.</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="680" height="19" font="3">&#34;It <i>can't</i> be&#34;, she said, and raised her eyes to me. &#34;Oh Paul, it isn't . .. it <i>can't</i> be!&#34;</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">&#34;Watch,&#34; I said, &#34;and then tell me that.&#34;</text>
<text top="335" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">From the bag on the table I took a spool which I had colored myself - not with Crayolas but with Magic</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Markers, an invention undreamed of in 1932. It came to the same, though. It was as bright as Del's had</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">been, maybe brighter. <i>Messieurs et mesdames, I</i> thought. <i>Bienvenue au cirque du mousie!</i></text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">I squatted again, and Mr. Jingles ran off my palm. He was old, but as obsessed as ever. From the moment</text>
<text top="446" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">I had taken the spool out of the bag, he'd had eyes for nothing else. I rolled it across the shed's uneven,</text>
<text top="470" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">splintery floor, and he was after it at once. He didn't run with his old speed, and his limp was painful to</text>
<text top="494" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">watch, but why should he have been either fast or surefooted? As I've said, he was old, a Methuselah of a</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="226" height="19" font="3">mouse. Sixty-four, at least.</text>
<text top="557" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">He reached the spool, which struck the far wall and bounced back. He went around it, then lay down on</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">his side. Elaine started forward and I held her back. After a moment, Mr. Jingles found his feet again.</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">Slowly, so slowly, he nosed the spool back to me. When he'd first come - I'd found him lying on the steps</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">leading to the kitchen in just that same way, as if he'd travelled a long distance and was exhausted - he</text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">had still been able to guide the spool with his paws, as he had done all those years ago on the Green Mile.</text>
<text top="677" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">That was beyond him, now; his hindquarters would no longer support him. Yet his nose was as educated</text>
<text top="701" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">as ever. He just had to go from one end of the spool to the other to keep it on course. When he reached</text>
<text top="725" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">me, I picked him up in one hand - no more than a feather, he weighed - and the spool in the other. His</text>
<text top="749" left="15" width="243" height="19" font="3">bright dark eyes never left it.</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="699" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't do it again, Paul,&#34; Elaine said in a broken voice. &#34;I can't bear to watch him.&#34;</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">I understood how she felt, but thought she was wrong to ask it. He loved chasing and fetching the spool;</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="785" height="19" font="3">after all the years, he still loved it just as much. We should all be so fortunate in our passions.</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;There are peppermint candies in the bag, too,&#34; I said. &#34;Canada Mints. I think he still likes them - he</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">won't stop sniffing, if I hold one out to him - but his digestion has gotten too bad to eat them. I bring him</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="123" height="19" font="3">toast, instead.&#34;</text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">I squatted again, broke a small fragment off the piece I'd brought with me from the sunroom, and put it</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">on the floor. Mr. Jingles sniffed at it, then picked it up in his paws and began to eat. His tail was coiled</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="503" height="19" font="3">neatly around him. He finished, then looked expectantly up.</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">&#34;Sometimes us old fellas can surprise you with our appetites&#34;, I said to Elaine, and handed her the toast.</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="87" height="19" font="3">&#34;You try.&#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="213" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">She broke off another fragment and dropped it on the floor. Mr. Jingles approached it, sniffed, looked at</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="368" height="19" font="3">Elaine ... then picked it up and began to eat.</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="418" height="19" font="3">&#34;You see?&#34; I said. &#34;He knows you're not a floater.</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="284" height="19" font="3">&#34;Where did he come from, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="176" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">&#34;Haven't a clue. One day when I went out for my early-morning walk, he was just here, lying on the</text>
<text top="200" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">kitchen steps. I knew who he was right away, but I got a spool out of the laundry room occasional basket</text>
<text top="224" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">just to be sure. And I got him a cigar box. Lined it with the softest stuff I could find. He's like us, Ellie, I</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">think-most days just one big sore place. Still, he hasn't lost all his zest for living. He still likes his spool,</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">and he still likes a visit from his old blockmate. Sixty years I held the story of John Coffey inside me,</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">sixty and more, and now I've told it. I kind of had the idea that's why he came back. To let me know I</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="753" height="19" font="3">should hurry up and do it while there was still time. Because I'm like him - getting there.&#34;</text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="146" height="19" font="3">&#34;Getting where?&#34;</text>
<text top="398" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">&#34;Oh, you know&#34;, I said, and we watched Mr. Jingles for awhile in silence. Then, for no reason I could tell</text>
<text top="422" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">you, I tossed the spool again, even though Elaine had asked me not to. Maybe only because, in a way,</text>
<text top="461" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">him chasing a spool was like old people having their slow and careful version of sex - you might not</text>
<text top="485" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">want to watch it, you who are young and convinced that, when it comes to old age, an exception will be</text>
<text top="509" left="15" width="383" height="19" font="3">made in your case, but <i>they </i>still want to do it.</text>
<text top="548" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">Mr. Jingles set off after the rolling spool again, clearly with pain, and just as clearly (to me, at least) with</text>
<text top="572" left="15" width="273" height="19" font="3">all his old, obsessive enjoyment.</text>
<text top="611" left="15" width="462" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ivy-glass windows,&#34; she whispered, watching him go.</text>
<text top="650" left="15" width="333" height="19" font="3">&#34;Ivy-glass windows,&#34; I agreed, smiling.</text>
<text top="689" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">&#34;John Coffey touched the mouse the way he touched you. He didn't just make you better of what was</text>
<text top="713" left="15" width="458" height="19" font="3">wrong with you then, he made you ... what, resistant?&#34;</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="330" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's as good a word as any, I think.&#34;</text>
<text top="791" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">&#34;Resistant to the things that eventually bring the rest of us down like trees with termites in them. You ...</text>
<text top="815" left="15" width="544" height="19" font="3">and him. Mr. Jingles. When he cupped Mr. Jingles in his hands.&#34;</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;That's right. Whatever power worked through John did that - that's what I think, anyway - and now it's</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">finally wearing off. The termites have chewed their way through our bark. It took a little longer than it</text>
<text top="902" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">does ordinarily, but they got there. I may have a few more years, men still live longer than mice, I guess,</text>
<text top="926" left="15" width="328" height="19" font="3">but Mr. Jingles's time is just about up.&#34;</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="807" height="19" font="3">He reached the spool, limped around it, fell over on his side, breathing rapidly (we could see his</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">respiration moving through his gray fur like ripples), then got up and began to push it gamely back with</text>
<text top="1013" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">his nose. His fur was gray, his gait was unsteady, but the oilspots that were his eyes gleamed as brightly</text>
<text top="1037" left="15" width="64" height="19" font="3">as ever.</text>
<text top="1076" left="15" width="736" height="19" font="3">&#34;You think he wanted you to write what you have written,'., she said. &#34;Is that so, Paul?&#34;</text>
<text top="1115" left="15" width="468" height="19" font="3">&#34;Not Mr. Jingles,&#34; I said. &#34;Not him but the force that - &#34;</text>
</page>
<page number="214" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">&#34;Why, Paulie! And Elaine Connelly, too!&#34; a voice cried from the open door. It was loaded with a kind of</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="742" height="19" font="3">satiric horror. &#34;As I live and breathe! What in the goodness can you two be doing here?&#34;</text>
<text top="98" left="15" width="881" height="19" font="3">I turned, not at all surprised to see Brad Dolan there in the doorway. He was grinning as a man only does</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">when he feels he's fooled you right good and proper. How far down the road had he driven after his shift</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">was over? Maybe only as far as The Wrangler for a beer or two and maybe a lap-dance before coming</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="45" height="19" font="3">back.</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="417" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get out,&#34; Elaine said coldly. &#34;Get out right now.'</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't you tell me to get <i>out,</i> you wrinkledy old bitch,&#34; he said, still smiling. &#34;Maybe you can tell me that</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">up the hill, but you ain't tip the hill now. This ain't where you're supposed to be. This is off-limits. Little</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">love-nest, Paulie? Is that what you got here? Kind of a Playboy pad for the geriatric...&#34; His eyes widened</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="433" height="19" font="3">as he at last saw the shed's tenant. &#34;What the <i>fuck?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="359" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">I didn't turn to look. I knew what was there, for one thing; for another, the past had suddenly doubled</text>
<text top="383" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">over the present, making one terrible image, three-dimensional in its reality. It wasn't Brad Dolan</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">standing there in the doorway but Percy Wetmore. In another moment he would rush into the shed and</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">crush Mr. Jingles (who no longer had a hope of outrunning him) under his shoe, and this time there was</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">no John Coffey to bring him back from the edge of death. Any more than there had been a John Coffey</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="415" height="19" font="3">when I needed him on that rainy day in Alabama.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">I got to my feet, not feeling any ache in my joints or muscles this time, and rushed toward Dolan. &#34;Leave</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="557" height="19" font="3">him alone!&#34; I yelled. &#34;You leave him alone, Percy, or by God I'll &#34;</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Who you callin Percy?&#34; he asked, and pushed me back so hard I almost fell over. Elaine grabbed me,</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="888" height="19" font="3">although it must have hurt her to do so, and steadied me. &#34;Ain't the first time you done it, either. And stop</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="691" height="19" font="3">peein in your pants. I ain't gonna touch im. Don't need to. That's one dead rodent.&#34;</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">I turned, thinking that Mr. Jingles was only lying on his side to catch his breath, the way he sometimes</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">did. He was on his side, all right, but that rippling motion through his fur had stopped. I tried to convince</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">myself that I could still see it, and then Elaine burst into loud sobs. She bent painfully, and picked up the</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">mouse I had first seen on the Green Mile, coming up to the duty desk as fearlessly as a man approaching</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="792" height="19" font="3">his peers .. . or his friends. He lay limp on her hand. His eyes were dull and still. He was dead.</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Dolan grinned unpleasantly, revealing teeth which had had very little acquaintance with a dentist. &#34;Aw,</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="820" height="19" font="4"><i>sakes,</i> now!&#34; he said. &#34;Did we just lose the family pet? Should we have a little funeral, with paper</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="125" height="19" font="3">flowers and - &#34;</text>
<text top="890" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">&#34;<i>SHUT</i> up!&#34; Elaine screamed at him, so-loudly and so powerfully that he backed away a step, the smile</text>
<text top="914" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">slipping off his face. <i>&#34;GETOUT OF HERE! GET OUT OR YOU'LL NEVER WORK ANOTHER DAY</i></text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="401" height="19" font="4"><i>HERE! NOT ANOTHER HOUR! I SWEAR IT!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="977" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;You won't be able to get so much as a slice of bread on a breadline,&#34; I said, but so low neither of them</text>
<text top="1001" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">heard me. I couldn't take my eyes off Mr. Jingles, lying on Elaine's palm like the world's smallest</text>
<text top="1025" left="15" width="110" height="19" font="3">bearskin rug.</text>
<text top="1064" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">Brad thought about coming back at her, calling her bluff he was right, the shed wasn't exactly approved</text>
<text top="1088" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">territory for the Georgia Pines inmates, even I knew that much - and then didn't. He was, at heart, a</text>
<text top="1112" left="15" width="832" height="19" font="3">coward, just like Percy. And he might have checked on her claim that her grandson was Somebody</text>

<page number="215" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="35" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">Important and had discovered it was a true claim. Most of all, perhaps, his curiosity had been satisfied,</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">his thirst to know slaked. And after all his wondering, the mystery had turned out not to be such of a</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">much. An old man's pet mouse had apparently been living in the shed. Now it had croaked, had a heart</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="428" height="19" font="3">attack or something while pushing a colored spool.</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="804" height="19" font="3">&#34;Don't know why you're getting so het up,&#34; he said. &#34;Either of you. You act like it was a dog, or</text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="101" height="19" font="3">something.&#34;</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">&#34;Get out,&#34; she spat. &#34;Get out, you ignorant man. What little mind you have is ugly and misdirected.&#34;</text>
<text top="248" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">He flushed dully, the spots where his high school pimples had been filling in a darker red. There had</text>
<text top="272" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">been a lot of them, by the look. &#34;I'll go,&#34; he said, &#34;but when you come down here tomorrow... <i>Paulie</i> ...</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">you're going to find a new lock on this door. This place is off-limits to the residents, no matter what</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="844" height="19" font="3">bad-tempered things old Mrs. My Shit Don't Stink has to say about me. Look at the floor! Boards all</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="817" height="19" font="3">warped and rotted! If you was to go through, your scrawny old leg'd be apt to snap like a piece of</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">kindling. So just take that dead mouse, if you want it, and get gone. The Love Shack is hereby closed.&#34;</text>
<text top="407" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">He turned and strode away, looking like a man who believes he's earned at least a draw. I waited until he</text>
<text top="431" left="15" width="800" height="19" font="3">was gone, and then gently took Mr. Jingles from Elaine. My eyes happened on the bag with the</text>
<text top="455" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">peppermint candies in it, and that did it - the tears began to come. I don't know, I just cry easier somehow</text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="92" height="19" font="3">these days.</text>
<text top="518" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">&#34;Would you help me to bury an old friend?&#34; I asked Elaine when Brad Dolan's heavy footsteps had faded</text>
<text top="542" left="15" width="50" height="19" font="3">away.</text>
<text top="581" left="15" width="866" height="19" font="3">&#34;Yes, Paul.&#34; She put her arm around my waist and laid her head against my shoulder. With one old and</text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="720" height="19" font="3">twisted finger, she stroked Mr. Jingles's moveless side. &#34;I would be happy to do that.&#34;</text>
<text top="644" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">And so we borrowed a trowel from the gardening shed and we buried Del's pet mouse as the afternoon</text>
<text top="668" left="15" width="826" height="19" font="3">shadows drew long through the trees, and then we walked back to get our supper and take up what</text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">remained of our lives. And it was Del I found myself thinking of, Del kneeling on the green carpet of my</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">office with his hands folded and his bald pate gleaming in the lamplight, Del who had asked us to take</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">care of Mr. Jingles, to make sure the bad 'un wouldn't hurt him anymore. Except the bad 'un hurts us all</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="186" height="19" font="3">in the end, doesn't he?</text>
<text top="803" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">&#34;Paul?&#34; Elaine asked. Her voice was both kind and exhausted. Even digging a grave with a trowel and</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="849" height="19" font="3">laying a mouse to rest in it is a lot of excitement for old sweeties like us, I guess. &#34;Are you all right?&#34;</text>
<text top="866" left="15" width="521" height="19" font="3">My arm was around her waist. I squeezed it. &#34;I'm fine,&#34; I said.</text>
<text top="905" left="15" width="715" height="19" font="3">&#34;Look,&#34; she said. &#34;It's going to be a beautiful sunset. Shall we stay out and watch it?&#34;</text>
<text top="944" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">&#34;All right,&#34; I said, and we stayed there on the lawn is for quite awhile, arms around each other's waists,</text>
<text top="968" left="15" width="783" height="19" font="3">first watching the bright colors come up in the sky, then watching them fade to ashes of gray.</text>

<text top="113" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">Our third grandchild, a beautiful girl named Tessa, was graduating from the University of Florida. We</text>
<text top="137" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">went down on a Greyhound. Sixty-four, I was then, a mere stripling. Jan was fifty-nine, and as beautiful</text>
<text top="161" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">as ever. To me, at least. We were sitting in the seat all the way at the back, and she was fussing at me for</text>
<text top="185" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">not buying her a new camera to record the blessed event. I opened my mouth to tell her we had a day to</text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">shop in after we got down there, and she could have a new camera if she wanted one, it would fit the</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">budget all right, and furthermore I thought she was just fussing because she was bored with the ride and</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">didn't like the book she'd brought. A Perry Mason, it was. That's when everything in my memory goes</text>
<text top="281" left="15" width="452" height="19" font="3">white for a bit, like film that's been left out in the sun.</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">Do you remember that accident? I suppose a few folks reading this might, but mostly not. Yet it made</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">front-page headlines from coast to coast when it happened. We were outside Birmingham in a driving</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">rain, Janice complaining about her old camera, and a tire blew. The bus waltzed sideways on the wet</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="854" height="19" font="3">pavement and was hit broadside by a truck hauling fertilizer. The truck slammed the bus into a bridge</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">abutment at better than sixty miles an hour, crushed it against the concrete, and broke it in half. Two</text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">shiny, rain-streaked pieces spun in two opposite directions, the one with the diesel tank in it exploding</text>
<text top="464" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">and sending a red-black fireball up into the rainygray sky. At one moment Janice was complaining about</text>
<text top="488" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">her old Kodak, and at the very next I found myself lying on the far side of the underpass in the rain and</text>
<text top="512" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">staring at a pair of blue nylon panties that had spilled out of someone's suitcase. WEDNESDAY was</text>
<text top="536" left="15" width="875" height="19" font="3">stitched on them in black thread. There were burst-open suitcases everywhere. And bodies. And parts of</text>
<text top="560" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">bodies. There were seventy-three people on that bus, and only four survived the crash. I was one of them,</text>
<text top="584" left="15" width="261" height="19" font="3">the only one not seriously hurt.</text>
<text top="623" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">I got up and staggered among the burst-open suitcases and shattered people, crying out my wife's name. I</text>
<text top="647" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">kicked aside an alarm clock, I remember that, and I remember seeing a dead boy of about thirteen lying</text>
<text top="671" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">in a strew of glass with P.F. Flyers on his feet and half his face gone. I felt the rain beating on my own</text>
<text top="695" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">face, then I went through the underpass and it was gone for awhile. When I came out on the other side it</text>
<text top="719" left="15" width="829" height="19" font="3">was there again, hammering my cheeks and forehead. Lying by the shattered cab of the overturned</text>
<text top="743" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">fertilizer truck, I saw Jan. I recognized her by her red dress - it was her second-best. The best she had</text>
<text top="767" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">been saving for the actual graduation, of course.</text>
<text top="806" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">She wasn't quite dead. I have often thought it would have been better - for me, if not for her - if she had</text>
<text top="830" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">been killed instantly. It might have made it possible for me to let her go a little sooner, a little more</text>
<text top="854" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">naturally. Or perhaps I'm only kidding myself about that. All I know for sure is that I have <i>never</i> let her</text>
<text top="878" left="15" width="117" height="19" font="3">go, not really.</text>
<text top="917" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">She was trembling all over. One of her shoes had come off and I could see her foot jittering. Her eyes</text>
<text top="941" left="15" width="754" height="19" font="3">were open but blank, the left one full of blood, and as I fell on my knees next to her in the</text>
<text top="965" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">smoky-smelling rain, all I could think of was that jitter meant she was being electrocuted; she was being</text>
<text top="989" left="15" width="502" height="19" font="3">electrocuted and I had to hold the roll before it was too late.</text>
<text top="1028" left="15" width="456" height="19" font="3">&#34;Help me!&#34; I screamed. &#34;Help me, someone help me!&#34;</text>
<text top="1067" left="15" width="793" height="19" font="3">No one helped, no one even came. The rain pounded down - a hard, soaking rain that flattened</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">My still-black hair against my skull - and I held her in my arms and no one came. Her blank eyes looked</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">up at me with a kind of dazed intensity, and blood poured from the back of her crushed head in a freshet.</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">Beside one trembling, mindlessly spasming hand was a piece of chromed steel with the letters GREY on</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">it. Next to that was roughly one quarter of what had once been a businessman in a brown Wool suit.</text>
<text top="122" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;Help me!&#34; I</i> screamed again, and turned toward the underpass, and there I saw John Coffey standing in</text>
<text top="146" left="15" width="837" height="19" font="3">the shadows, only a shadow himself, a big man with long, dangling arms and a bald head. <i>&#34;John!&#34; I</i></text>
<text top="170" left="15" width="496" height="19" font="3">screamed. <i>&#34;Oh John , please help me! Please help Janice!&#34;</i></text>
<text top="209" left="15" width="855" height="19" font="3">Rain ran into my eyes. I blinked it away, and he was gone. I could see the shadows I had mistaken for</text>
<text top="233" left="15" width="887" height="19" font="3">John ... but it hadn't been <i>only</i> shadows. I'm sure of that. He was there. Maybe only as a ghost, but he was</text>
<text top="257" left="15" width="564" height="19" font="3">there, the rain on his face mixing with the endless flow of his tears.</text>
<text top="296" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">She died in my arms, there in the rain beside that fertilizer truck with the smell of burning diesel fuel in</text>
<text top="320" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">my nose. There was no moment of awareness - the eyes clearing, the lips moving in some whispered</text>
<text top="344" left="15" width="877" height="19" font="3">final declaration of love. There was a kind of shivery clench in the flesh beneath my hands, and then she</text>
<text top="368" left="15" width="846" height="19" font="3">was gone. I thought of Melinda Moores for the first time in years, then, Melinda sitting up in the bed</text>
<text top="392" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">where all the doctors at Indianola General Hospital had believed she would die; Melinda Moores looking</text>
<text top="416" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">fresh and rested and peering at John Coffey with bright, wondering eyes. Melinda saying I <i>dreamed you</i></text>
<text top="440" left="15" width="538" height="19" font="4"><i>were wandering in the dark, and so was I. We found each other.</i></text>
<text top="479" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">I put my wife's poor, mangled head down on the wet pavement of the interstate highway, got to my feet</text>
<text top="503" left="15" width="861" height="19" font="3">(it was easy; I had a little cut on the side of my left hand, but that was all), and screamed his name into</text>
<text top="527" left="15" width="251" height="19" font="3">the shadows of the underpass.</text>
<text top="566" left="15" width="484" height="19" font="4"><i>&#34;John! JOHN COFFEY! WHERE ARE YOU, BIG BOY?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="605" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">I walked toward those shadows, kicking aside a teddy-bear with blood on its fur, a pair of steel rimmed</text>
<text top="629" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">eyeglasses with one shattered lens, a severed hand with a garnet ring on the pinky finger. &#34;You <i>saved</i></text>
<text top="653" left="15" width="611" height="19" font="4"><i>Hal's wife, why not my wife? Why not Janice? WHY NOT MY JANICE?&#34;</i></text>
<text top="692" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">No answer; only the smell of burning diesel and burning bodies, only the rain falling ceaselessly out of</text>
<text top="716" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">the gray sky and drumming on the cement while my wife lay dead on the road behind me. No answer</text>
<text top="740" left="15" width="865" height="19" font="3">then and no answer now. But of course it wasn't only Melly Moores that John Coffey saved in 1932, or</text>
<text top="764" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Del's mouse, the one that could do that cute trick with the spool and seemed to be looking for Del long</text>
<text top="788" left="15" width="575" height="19" font="3">before Del showed up ... long before John Coffey showed up, either.</text>
<text top="827" left="15" width="850" height="19" font="3">John saved me, too, and years later, standing in the pouring Alabama rain and looking for a man who</text>
<text top="851" left="15" width="848" height="19" font="3">wasn't there in the shadows of an underpass, standing amid the spilled luggage and the ruined dead, I</text>
<text top="875" left="15" width="805" height="19" font="3">learned a terrible thing: sometimes there is absolutely no difference at all between salvation and</text>
<text top="899" left="15" width="94" height="19" font="3">damnation.</text>
<text top="938" left="15" width="843" height="19" font="3">I felt one or the other pouring through me as we sat together on his bunk - November the eighteenth,</text>
<text top="962" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">nineteen and thirty-two. Pouring out of him and into me, whatever strange force he had in him coming</text>
<text top="986" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">through our joined hands in a way our love and hope and good intentions somehow never can, a feeling</text>
<text top="1010" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">that began as a tingle and then turned into something tidal and enormous, a force beyond anything I had</text>
<text top="1034" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">ever experienced before or have ever experienced since. Since that day I have never had pneumonia, or</text>
<text top="1058" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">the flu, or even a strep throat. I have never had another urinary infection, or so much as an infected cut. I</text>
<text top="1082" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">have had colds, but they have been infrequent - six or seven years apart, and although people who don't</text>
<text top="1106" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">have colds often are supposed to suffer more serious ones, that has never been the case with me. Once,</text>

<text top="35" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">earlier on in that awful year of 1956, I passed a gallstone. And although I suppose it will sound strange to</text>
<text top="59" left="15" width="856" height="19" font="3">some reading this in spite of all I have said, part of me relished the pain that came when that gallstone</text>
<text top="83" left="15" width="841" height="19" font="3">went. It was the only serious pain I'd had since that problem with my waterworks, twenty-four years</text>
<text top="107" left="15" width="869" height="19" font="3">before. The ills that have taken my friends and same-generation loved ones until there are none of them</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">left - the strokes, the cancers, the heart attacks, the liver diseases, the blood diseases - have all left me</text>

<text top="179" left="15" width="872" height="19" font="3">in the road. The one serious accident I was in left me untouched save for a scratch on the hand. In 1932,</text>
<text top="203" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">John Coffey inoculated me with life. <i>Electrocuted</i> me with life, you might say. I will pass on eventually -</text>
<text top="227" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">of course I will, any illusions of immortality I might have had died with Mr. Jingles - but I will have</text>
<text top="251" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">wished for death long before death finds me. Truth to tell, I wish for it already and have ever since Elaine</text>

<text top="314" left="15" width="852" height="19" font="3">I look back over these pages, leafing through them with my trembling, spotted hands, and I wonder if</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">there is some meaning here, as in those books which are supposed to be uplifting and ennobling. I think</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="858" height="19" font="3">back to the sermons of my childhood, booming affirmations in the church of Praise Jesus, The Lord Is</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="845" height="19" font="3">Mighty, and I recall how the preachers used to say that God's eye is on the sparrow, that He sees and</text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="879" height="19" font="3">marks even the least of His creations. When I think of Mr. Jingles, and the tiny scraps of wood we found</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">in that hole in the beam, I think that is so. Yet this same God sacrificed John Coffey, who tried only to do</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="882" height="19" font="3">good in his blind way, as savagely as any Old Testament prophet ever sacrificed a defenseless Iamb ... as</text>
<text top="482" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">Abraham would have sacrificed his own son if actually called upon to do so. I think of John saying that</text>
<text top="506" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">Wharton killed the Detterick twins with their love for each other, and that it happens every day, all over</text>
<text top="530" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">the world. If it happens, God <i>lets</i> it happen, and when we say &#34;I don't understand,&#34; God replies, &#34;I don't</text>
<text top="554" left="15" width="49" height="19" font="3">care.&#34;</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="831" height="19" font="3">I think of Mr. Jingles dying while my back was turned and my attention usurped by an unkind man</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="871" height="19" font="3">whose finest emotion seemed to be a species of vindictive curiosity. I think of Janice, jittering away her</text>
<text top="641" left="15" width="433" height="19" font="3">last mindless seconds as I knelt with her in the rain.</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="4"><i>Stop it, I</i> tried to tell John that day in his cell. <i>Let go of my hands, I'm going to drown if you don't. Drown</i></text>

<text top="743" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="3">&#34;You won't 'splode,&#34; he answered, hearing my thought and smiling at the idea. And the horrible thing is</text>

<text top="806" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">I have at least one old man's ill: I suffer from insomnia. Late at night I lie in my bed, listening to the dank</text>

<text top="854" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">hear a call-bell, or the squeak of a shoe in the corridor, or Mrs. Javits's little TV tuned to the late news. I</text>

<text top="107" left="15" width="842" height="19" font="3">looking like a success, at least in terms of sales. For that, Constant Reader, I want to thank you. And</text>
<text top="131" left="15" width="868" height="19" font="3">something a bit different wakes us all up a little, maybe - lets us see the old business of storytelling in a</text>
<text top="155" left="15" width="404" height="19" font="3">new way. That's how it worked for me, anyway.</text>
<text top="194" left="15" width="876" height="19" font="3">I wrote in a hurry because the format demanded that I write in a hurry. That was part of the exhilaration,</text>
<text top="218" left="15" width="885" height="19" font="3">but it also may have produced a number of anachronisms. The guards and prisoners listen to <i>Allen's Alley</i></text>
<text top="242" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">on their E Block radio, and I doubt if Fred Allen was actually broadcasting in 1932. The same may hold</text>
<text top="266" left="15" width="816" height="19" font="3">true for Kay Kyser and his <i>Kollege of Musical Knowledge. </i>This isn't to let me off the hook, but it</text>
<text top="290" left="15" width="874" height="19" font="3">sometimes seems to me that history which has recently fallen over the horizon is harder to research than</text>
<text top="314" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">the Middle Ages or the time of the Crusades. I was able to determine that Brutal might indeed have</text>
<text top="338" left="15" width="853" height="19" font="3">called the mouse on the Mile Steamboat Willy - the Disney cartoon had been in existence almost four</text>
<text top="362" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">years by then - but I have a sneaking suspicion that the little pornographic comic book featuring Popeye</text>
<text top="386" left="15" width="886" height="19" font="3">and Olive Oyl is an artifact out of time. I might clean up some of this stuff when and if I decide to do <i>The</i></text>
<text top="410" left="15" width="870" height="19" font="4"><i>Green Mile</i> as a single volume ... but maybe I'll leave the goofs. After all, doesn't the great Shakespeare</text>
<text top="434" left="15" width="880" height="19" font="3">himself include in Julius <i>Caesar</i> the anachronism of a striking clock long before mechanical clocks were</text>
<text top="458" left="15" width="82" height="19" font="3">invented?</text>
<text top="497" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">Doing <i>The Green Mile</i> as a single volume would present its own unique challenges, I have come to</text>
<text top="521" left="15" width="873" height="19" font="3">realize, partly because the book couldn't be published as it was issued in its installments. Because I took</text>
<text top="545" left="15" width="799" height="19" font="3">Charles Dickens as my model, I asked several people how Dickens had handled the problem of</text>
<text top="569" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">refreshing his readers, recollections at the beginning of each new episode. I had expected something like</text>
<text top="593" left="15" width="811" height="19" font="3">the synopses which preceded each installment of my beloved <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> serials, and</text>
<text top="617" left="15" width="750" height="19" font="3">discovered that Dickens had not been so crude; he built the synopsis into the actual story.</text>
<text top="656" left="15" width="836" height="19" font="3">While I was trying to decide how to do this, my Wife began telling me (she doesn't exactly nag, but</text>
<text top="680" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">sometimes she <i>advocates</i> rather ruthlessly) that I had never really finished the story of Mr. Jingles, the</text>
<text top="704" left="15" width="833" height="19" font="3">circus mouse. I thought she was right, and began to see that, by making Mr. Jingles a secret of Paul</text>
<text top="728" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">Edgecombe's in his old age, I could create a fairly interesting &#34;front story.&#34;(The result is a little bit like</text>
<text top="752" left="15" width="860" height="19" font="3">the form taken by the film version of <i>Fried Green Tomatoes.)</i> In fact, everything in Paul's front story -</text>
<text top="776" left="15" width="847" height="19" font="3">the story of his life at the Georgia Pines old folks, home - turned out to my satisfaction. I particularly</text>
<text top="800" left="15" width="883" height="19" font="3">liked the way that Dolan, the orderly, and Percy Wetmore became entwined in Paul's mind. And that was</text>
<text top="824" left="15" width="878" height="19" font="3">not something I planned or did on purpose; like the happiest of fictions, it just ambled along and stepped</text>
<text top="848" left="15" width="113" height="19" font="3">into its place.</text>
<text top="887" left="15" width="859" height="19" font="3">I want to thank Ralph Vicinanza for bringing me the - serial thriller - idea in the first place, and all my</text>
<text top="911" left="15" width="867" height="19" font="3">friends at Viking Penguin and Signet for getting behind it, even though they were scared to death at the</text>
<text top="935" left="15" width="862" height="19" font="3">beginning (all writers are crazy, and of course they knew that). I also want to thank Marsha DeFilippo,</text>
<text top="959" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">who transcribed a whole stenographer's notebook full of my cramped handwriting and never complained.</text>
<text top="983" left="15" width="227" height="19" font="3">Well ... <i>rarely</i> complained.</text>
<text top="1022" left="15" width="864" height="19" font="3">Most of all, though, I want to thank my wife, Tabitha, who read this story and said she liked it. Writers</text>
<text top="1046" left="15" width="863" height="19" font="3">almost always write with some ideal reader in mind, I think, and my wife is mine. We don't always see</text>
<text top="1070" left="15" width="839" height="19" font="3">eye to eye when it comes to what we each write (hell, we rarely see eye to eye when we're shopping</text>
<text top="1094" left="15" width="884" height="19" font="3">together in the supermarket), but when she says it's good, it usually is. Because she's tough, and if I try to</text>
