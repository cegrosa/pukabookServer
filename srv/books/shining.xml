<text top="211" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  Ullman had asked a question he hadn't caught. That was bad; Ullman was the </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  No returning smile from Ullman. He slipped Jack's application back into the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">file. The file went into a drawer. The desk top was now completely bare except </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">for a blotter, a telephone, a Tensor lamp, and an in/out basket. Both sides of </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="207" height="17" font="0">the in/out were empty, too. </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="442" height="17" font="0">desk, if you will, Mr. Torrance. We'll look at the floor plans.&#34; </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">  He brought back five large sheets and set them down on the glossy walnut plain </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">of the desk. Jack stood by his shoulder, very much aware of the scent of </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">Ullman's cologne. All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">came into his mind for no reason at all, and he had to clamp his tongue between </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">his teeth to keep in a bray of laughter. Beyond the wall, faintly, came the </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="480" height="17" font="0">sounds of the Overlook Hotel's kitchen, gearing down from lunch. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Top floor,&#34; Ullman said briskly. &#34;The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don't want up </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don't believe </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">it, not for a moment, but there mustn't even be that one-in-a-hundred chance </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="331" height="17" font="0">that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.&#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  Jack, who suspected that every hotel in the world had a rat or two, held his </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="57" height="17" font="0">tongue. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="483" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Of course you wouldn't allow your son up in the attic under any </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="115" height="17" font="0">circumstances.&#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No,&#34; Jack said, and flashed the big PR smile again. Humiliating situation. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">Did this officious little prick actually think he would allow his son to goof </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">around in a rattrap attic full of junk furniture and God knew what else? </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  Ullman whisked away the attic floor plan and put it on the bottom of the pile. </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Forty rooms,&#34; Ullman said, &#34;thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="516" height="17" font="0">  Jack shook his head. Ullman whisked the second and first floors away. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now. Lobby level: Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are </text>

<text top="311" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge. </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Only about the basement,&#34; Jack said. &#34;For the winter caretaker, that's the </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="443" height="17" font="0">most important level of all. Where the action is, so to speak.&#34; </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Watson will show you all that. The basement floor plan is on the boiler room </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">concern himself with such mundane aspects of the Overlook's operation as the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">boiler and the plumbing. &#34;Might not be a bad idea to put some traps down there </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="150" height="17" font="0">too. Just a minute...&#34; </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  He scrawled a note on a pad he took from his inner coat pocket (each sheet </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">bore the legend From the Desk of Stuart Ullman in bold black script), tore it </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">off, and dropped it into the out basket. It sat there looking lonesome. The pad </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">disappeared back into Ullman's jacket pocket like the conclusion of a magician's </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">trick. Now you see it, Jacky-boy, now you don't. This guy is a real heavyweight. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  They had resumed their original positions, Ullman behind the desk and Jack in </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">front of it, interviewer and interviewee, supplicant and reluctant patron. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">Ullman folded his neat little hands on the desk blotter and looked directly at </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">Jack, a small, balding man in a banker's suit and a quiet gray tie. The flower </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">in his lapel was balanced off by a small lapel pin on the other side. It read </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="257" height="17" font="0">simply STAFF in small gold letters. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Torrance. Albert Shockley is a powerful </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">man with a large interest in the Overlook, which showed a profit this season for </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">the first time in its history. Mr. Shockley also sits on the Board of Directors, </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">but he is not a hotel man and he would be the first to admit this. But he has </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">previous history into the conversation. During the winter of 1970-71, after we </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">had refurbished the Overlook but before our first season, I hired this... this </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">unfortunate named Delbert Grady. He moved into the quarters you and your wife </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">and son will be sharing. He had a wife and two daughters. I had reservations, </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">the main ones being the harshness of the winter season and the fact that the </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">Gradys would be cut off from the outside world for five to six months.&#34; </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But that's not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">citizen's band radio as well. And the Rocky Mountain National Park is within </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">helicopter range and surely a piece of ground that big must have a chopper or </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I wouldn't know about that,&#34; Ullman said. &#34;The hotel does have a two-way </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">  Mr. Ullman looked pained. &#34;Suppose your son or your wife tripped on the stairs </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">and fractured his or her skull, Mr. Torrance. Would you think the place was cut </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">terrifying thing about DIVORCE was that he had sensed the word-or concept, or </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="620" height="17" font="0">They came to him only as colors and moods. Mommy's DIVORCE thoughts centered </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  His father had said: &#34;He's having a Ha Loo Sin Nation. He seems okay, but I </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">Because when he bad concentrated his mind, it had flown out to his daddy, and </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">for just a moment, before Tony had appeared (far away, as be always did, calling </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  It had happened twice since they moved to Boulder, and he remembered how </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">surprised and pleased he had been to find Tony had followed him all the way from </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">  Three or four days later his daddy had been stomping around, telling Mommy </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">furiously that he had been all over the goddam basement and the trunk wasn't </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">there and he was going to sue the goddam movers who had left it somewhere </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">between Vermont and Colorado. How was he supposed to be able to finish &#34;THE </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="315" height="17" font="0">PLAY&#34; if things like this kept cropping up? </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  Danny said, &#34;No, Daddy. It's under the stairs. The movers put it right under </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="78" height="17" font="0">the stairs.&#34; </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  Daddy had given him a strange look and had gone down to see. The trunk had </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">been there, just where Tony had shown him. Daddy had taken him aside, had sat </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">him on his lap, and had asked Danny who let him down cellar. Had it been Tom </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">from upstairs? The cellar was dangerous, Daddy said. That was why the landlord </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="605" height="17" font="0">kept it locked. If someone was leaving it unlocked, Daddy wanted to know. He was </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">glad to have his papers and his &#34;PLAY&#34; but it wouldn't be worth it to him, he </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">said, if Danny fell down the stairs and broke his ... his leg. Danny told his </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">father earnestly that he hadn't been down in the cellar. That door was always </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">locked. And Mommy agreed. Danny never went down in the back hall, she said, </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="473" height="17" font="0">because it was damp and dark and spidery. And he didn't tell lies. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="347" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Then how did you know, doc?&#34; Daddy asked. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="155" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Tony showed me.&#34; </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  His mother and father had exchanged a look over his head. This had happened </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">before, from time to time. Because it was frightening, they swept it quickly </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="613" height="17" font="0">from their minds. But he knew they worried about Tony, Mommy especially, and he </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">was careful about thinking the way that could make Tony come where she might </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">see. But now he thought she was lying down, not moving about in the kitchen yet, </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">and so he concentrated hard to see if he could understand what Daddy was </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="113" height="17" font="0">thinking about. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  His brow furrowed and his slightly grimy hands clenched into tight fists on </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">his jeans. He did not close his eyes-that wasn't necessary-but he squinched them </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">down to slits and imagined Daddy's voice, Jack's voice, John Daniel Torrance's </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">voice, deep and steady, sometimes quirking up with amusement or deepening even </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">more with anger or just staying steady because he was thinking. Thinking of. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="200" height="17" font="0">Thinking about. Thinking .. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="86" height="17" font="0">  (thinking) </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  Danny sighed quietly and his body slumped on the curb as if all the muscles </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">had gone out of it. He was fully conscious; he saw the street and the girl and </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">leaves blowing along the gutter, yellow cartwheels of irregular shape. He saw </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">the house they were passing and noticed how the roof was covered with </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">there was a dim, painless tug as part of him got up and ran after Tony into </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Too deep,&#34; Tony said from the darkness, and there was a sadness in his voice </text>

<text top="311" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">suffered from fainting spells — they couldn't afford not to have one. So Jack had </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">security deposit, which really hurt. And so far the phone had been mute except </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">change in quarters. With the silver in his hand he walked over to the telephone </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">booth by the keymaking machine and slipped inside. From here he could see Danny </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">in the bug through three sets of glass. The boy's head was bent studiously over </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">his maps. Jack felt a wave of nearly desperate love for the boy. The emotion </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">  He supposed he could have made his obligatory thank-you call to Al from home; </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">ago he had been teaching English in one of the finest prep schools in New </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">England. There had been friends — although not exactly the same ones he'd had </text>

<text top="874" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">deft touch in the classroom and his private dedication to writing. Things had </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">been very good six months ago. All at once there was enough money left over at </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">the end of each two-week pay period to start a little savings account. In his </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">had stood a great many of the rounds. He and Wendy had begun to talk cautiously </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">about finding a house and making a down payment in a year or so. A farmhouse in </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">outside a bar, and the only thing that had kept him from going in was the </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">waters of oblivion, he had gone to Al Shockley's house. The Board's vote had </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">and the baby asleep on the couch, Danny always on the inside, a tiny fist curled </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">under the shelf of Wendy's jaw. He would look at them and the self-loathing </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">tense and never happy, but a reconciliation all the same. When she took Danny to </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">the house, she went without Jack. And she didn't tell Jack that her mother </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">mother would think if she saw the bruise before she thought of anything else —  </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">God help her, God help them both — and then picked Danny up, sat in the rocking </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">chair with him, soothed him. She had been thinking of her mother for most of the </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">five hours Jack had been gone, her mother's prophecy that Jack would never come </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">to anything. Big ideas, her mother had said. Sure. The welfare lines are full of </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">educated fools with big ideas. Did the Esquire story make her mother wrong or </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">right? Winnifred, you're not holding that baby right. Give him to me. And was </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">she not holding her husband right? Why else would he take his joy out of the </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">house? A helpless kind of terror had risen up in her and it never occurred to </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="498" height="17" font="0">her that he had gone out for reasons that had nothing to do with her. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Congratulations,&#34; she said, rocking Danny — he was almost asleep again. &#34;Maybe </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="205" height="17" font="0">you gave him a concussion.&#34; </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's just a bruise.&#34; He sounded sulky, wanting to be repentant: a little boy. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="212" height="17" font="0">For an instant she hated him. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Maybe,&#34; she said tightly. &#34;Maybe not.&#34; She heard so much of her mother </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">talking to her departed father in her own voice that she was sickened and </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="48" height="17" font="0">afraid. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="328" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Like mother like daughter,&#34; Jack muttered. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Go to bed!&#34; she cried, her fear coming out sounding like anger. &#34;Go to bed, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="108" height="17" font="0">you're drunk!&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="209" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't tell me what to do.&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="429" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Jack ... please, we shouldn't ... it ...&#34; There were no words. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't tell me what to do,&#34; he repeated sullenly, and then went into the </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">bedroom. She was left alone in the rocking chair with Danny, who was sleeping </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">again. Five minutes later Jack's snores came floating out to the living room. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="410" height="17" font="0">That had been the first night she had slept on the couch. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Now she turned restlessly on the bed, already dozing. Her mind, freed of any </text>

<text top="994" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">past the steadily worsening times that had reached low ebb when her husband had </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="431" height="17" font="0">broken Danny's arm, to that morning in the breakfast nook. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  Danny outside playing trucks in the sandpile, his arm still in the cast. Jack </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">months before the broken arm. She told herself she would have made the decision </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">long ago if it hadn't been for Danny, but not even that was necessarily true. </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">She dreamed on the long nights when Jack was out, and her dreams were always of </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="312" height="17" font="0">her mother's face and of her own wedding. </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  (Who giveth this woman? Her father standing in his best suit which was none </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">too good — he was a traveling salesman for a line of canned goods that even then </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">was going broke — and his tired face, how old he looked, how pale: I do.) </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  Even after the accident — if you could call it an accident — she had not been </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">able to bring it all the way out, to admit that her marriage was a lopsided </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">defeat. She had waited, dumbly hoping that a miracle would occur and Jack would </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">see what was happening, not only to him but to her. But there had been no </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">at the Stovington House. Three or four martinis before dinner. Five or six more </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">while grading papers. The weekends were worse. The nights out with Al Shockley </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">were worse still. She had never dreamed there could be so much pain in a life </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">when there was nothing physically wrong. She hurt all the time. How much of it </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">was her fault? That question haunted her. She felt like her mother. Like her </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">father. Sometimes, when she felt like herself she wondered what it would be like </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="610" height="17" font="0">for Danny, and she dreaded the day when he grew old enough to lay blame. And she </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="621" height="17" font="0">wondered where they would go. She had no doubt her mother would take her in, and </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">no doubt that after a year of watching her diapers remade, Danny's meals </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">recooked and/or redistributed, of coming home to find his clothes changed or his </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">hair cut or the books her mother found unsuitable spirited away to some limbo in </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="512" height="17" font="0">the attic ... after half a year of that, she would have a complete nervous </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="612" height="17" font="0">breakdown. And her mother would pat her hand and say comfortingly, Although it's </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">not your fault, it's all your own fault. You were never ready. You showed your </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">  The night before that morning she had lain awake almost until he came in, </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="239" height="17" font="0">thinking, coming to her decision. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  The divorce was necessary, she told herself. Her mother and father didn't </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">belong in the decision. Neither did her feelings of guilt over their marriage </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">nor her feelings of inadequacy over her own. It was necessary for her son's </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="511" height="17" font="0">sake, and for herself, if she was to salvage anything at all from her early </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">adulthood. The handwriting on the wall was brutal but clear. Her husband was a </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">lush. He had a bad temper, one he could no longer keep wholly under control now </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">that he was drinking so heavily and his writing was going so badly. Accidentally </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">or not accidentally, he had broken Danny's arm. He was going to lose his job, if </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">not this year then the year after. Already she had noticed the sympathetic looks </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">from the other faculty wives. She told herself that she had stuck with the messy </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">job of her marriage for as long as she could. Now she would have to leave it. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">Jack could have full visitation rights, and she would want support from him only </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">until she could find something and get on her feet — and that would have to be </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">fairly rapidly because she didn't know how long Jack would be able to pay </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">support money. She would do it with as little bitterness as possible. But it had </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  So thinking, she had fallen off into her own thin and unrestful sleep, haunted </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">by the faces of her own mother and father. You're nothing but a home-wrecker, </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">her mother said. Who giveth this, woman? the minister said. I do, her father </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">said. But in the bright and sunny morning she felt the same. Her back to him, </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="614" height="17" font="0">her hands plunged in warm dishwater up to the wrists, she had commenced with the </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="114" height="17" font="0">unpleasantness. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I want to talk to you about something that might be best for Danny and I. For </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="467" height="17" font="0">you too, maybe. We should have talked about it before, I guess.&#34; </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  And then he had said an odd thing. She had expected to discover his anger, to </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">provoke the bitterness, the recriminations. She had expected a mad dash for the </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">liquor cabinet. But not this soft, almost toneless reply that was so unlike him. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">It was almost as though the Jack she had lived with for six years had never come </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">back last night — as if he had been replaced by some unearthly doppelganger that </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="309" height="17" font="0">she would never know or be quite sure of. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="335" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Would you do something for me? A favor?&#34; </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What?&#34; She had to discipline her voice strictly to keep it from trembling. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="368" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Let's talk about it in a week. If you still want to&#34; </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="617" height="17" font="0">  And she had agreed. It remained unspoken between them. During that week he had </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">seen Al Shockley more than ever, but he came home early and there was no liquor </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">on his breath. She imagined she smelled it, but knew it wasn't so. Another week. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="99" height="17" font="0">And another. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="347" height="17" font="0">  Divorce went back to committee, unvoted on. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  What had happened? She still wondered and still had not the slightest idea. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">The subject was taboo between them. He was like a man who had leaned around a </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">corner and had seen an unexpected monster lying in wait, crouching among the </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">dried bones of its old kills. The liquor remained in the cabinet, but he didn't </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">touch it. She had considered throwing them out a dozen times but in the end </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">always backed away from the idea, as if some unknown charm would be broken by </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="57" height="17" font="0">the act. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="335" height="17" font="0">  And there was Danny's part in it to consider. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  If she felt she didn't know her husband, then she was in awe of her child — awe </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">in the strict meaning of that word: a kind of undefined superstitious dread. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  Dozing lightly, the image of the instant of his birth was presented to her. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">She was again lying on the delivery table, bathed in sweat, her hair in strings, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="252" height="17" font="0">her feet splayed out in the stirrups </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="484" height="17" font="0">intervals, and several times she had screamed in spite of her shame. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  Then the doctor told her quite sternly that she must PUSH, and she did, and </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">then she felt something being taken from her. It was a clear and distinct </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">feeling, one she would never forget-the thing taken. Then the doctor held her </text>

<text top="1055" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">and as the doctor groped for the airmask, she had seen something else, something </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  Something had changed him. She didn't believe it was just her getting ready to </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  The road wound up and up in a series of slow S curves, and Jack dropped the </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">and protested, and Wendy's eye fixed on the speedometer needle, which sank from </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="395" height="17" font="0">forty to thirty to twenty, where it hovered reluctantly. </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  For Wendy, it was discovering truth in a cliché: her breath was taken away. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">For a moment she was unable to breathe at all; the view had knocked the wind </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">knew how far? — an even taller mountain reared into the sky, its jagged tip only </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">a silhouette that was now nimbused by the sun, which was beginning its decline. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">The whole valley floor was spread out below them, the slopes that they had </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">climbed in the laboring bug falling away with such dizzying suddenness that she </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">knew to look down there for too long would bring on nausea and eventual </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">vomiting. The imagination seemed to spring to full life in the clear air, beyond </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">the rein of reason, and to look was to helplessly see one's self plunging down </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">saw the grimly clinging pines give way to a wide square of green lawn and </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="444" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What was it, Danny?&#34; she asked. &#34;Were you dizzy, honey?&#34; </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="501" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, I was just ... thinking. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.&#34; He </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">looked at his parents, kneeling in front of him, and offered them a small </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="455" height="17" font="0">puzzled smile. &#34;Maybe it was the sun. The sun got in my eyes.&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;We'll get you up to the hotel and give you a drink of water,&#34; Daddy said. </text>

<text top="533" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">  Ullman seemed truly warm toward Danny only, but Wendy had experienced that </text>
<text top="553" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">before. Danny seemed to be a child for people who ordinarily held W. C. Fields' </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">sentiments about children. He bent a little from the waist and offered Danny his </text>
<text top="594" left="99" width="346" height="17" font="0">hand. Danny shook it formally, without a smile. </text>
<text top="614" left="99" width="401" height="17" font="0">  &#34;My son Danny,&#34; Jack said. &#34;And my wife Winnifred.&#34; </text>
<text top="634" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'm happy to meet you both,&#34; Ullman said. &#34;How old are you, Danny?&#34; </text>

<text top="674" left="99" width="498" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sir, yet.&#34; Ullman smiled and glanced at Jack. &#34;He's well mannered.&#34; </text>

<text top="714" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And Mrs. Torrance.&#34; He offered the same little bow, and for a bemused instant </text>

<text top="915" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">birch logs. Three nuns sat on a sofa that was drawn up almost to the hearth </text>

<text top="995" left="99" width="310" height="17" font="0">lips; not one of them could be under sixty. </text>
<text top="1015" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">  In the background was the constant hum of conversation, the muted ding! of the </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Do you like the animals?&#34; Wendy asked. &#34;That's called a topiary.&#34; Beyond the </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  The playground was beyond the topiary. Two slides, a big swing set with half a </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">rings, a sandbox, and a playhouse that was an exact replica of the Overlook </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I sure do,&#34; he said, hoping he sounded more enthused than he felt. &#34;It's </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">that had decided to snooze for a while, was the road that led back through </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">as best they could as she strode triumphantly out the door. Danny watched </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">through the window as a man in a gray uniform and a hat like a captain in the </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">Army brought her long silver car around to the door and got out. He tipped his </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="326" height="17" font="0">cap to her and ran around to open the trunk. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  And in one of those flashes that sometimes came, he got a complete thought </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">from her, one that floated above the confused, low-pitched babble of emotions </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="352" height="17" font="0">and colors that he usually got in crowded places. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="226" height="17" font="0">  (i' d like to get into his pants) </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">cold, even with that long fur coat on? And if she was that cold, why hadn't she </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">just put on some pants of her own? His mommy wore pants just about all winter. </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">  The man in the gray uniform closed the trunk and walked back to help her into </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">but she only smiled and gave him a dollar bill — a tip. A moment later she was </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="326" height="17" font="0">guiding the big silver car down the driveway. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  He thought about asking his mother why Mrs. Brant might want the car-man's </text>

<text top="654" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">personage at all. To begin with, such a personage was called a chef, nothing so </text>
<text top="674" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">mundane as a cook — cooking was what she did in her apartment kitchen when she </text>
<text top="694" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">threw all the leftovers into a greased Pyrex casserole dish and added noodles. </text>
<text top="714" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">Further, the culinary wizard of such a place as the Overlook, which advertised </text>

<text top="754" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">pasty-faced (rather like the Pillsbury Dough-Boy); he should have a thin pencil- </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann had the dark eyes and that was all. He was a tall black man with a </text>
<text top="835" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">modest afro that was beginning to powder white. He had a soft southern accent </text>
<text top="855" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">and he laughed a lot, disclosing teeth too white and too even to be anything but </text>
<text top="875" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">1950-vintage Sears and Roebuck dentures. Her own father had had a pair, which he </text>

<text top="955" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  Danny had stared up at this black giant in blue serge, and then had smiled </text>
<text top="975" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">when Hallorann picked him up easily, set him in the crook of his elbow, and </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="615" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann commenced to tour them around the most immense kitchen Wendy had </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">ever seen in her life. It was sparkling clean. Every surface was coaxed to a </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">high gloss. It was more than just big; it was intimidating. She walked at </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">Hallorann's side while Jack, wholly out of his element, hung back a little with </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">Danny. A long wallboard hung with cutting instruments which went all the way </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">from paring knives to twohanded cleavers hung beside a four-basin sink. There </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">was a breadboard as big as their Boulder apartment's kitchen table. An amazing </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">array of stainless-steel pots and pans hung from floor to ceiling, covering one </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't let it get you down,&#34; Hallorann said. &#34;It's big, but it's still only a </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">that's all I ask. Here's the stove I'd be using, if I was you. There are three </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  Smallest, she thought dismally, looking at it There were twelve burners, two </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">regular ovens and a Dutch oven, a heated well on top in which you could simmer </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">sauces or bake beans, a broiler, and a warmer — plus a million dials and </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="148" height="17" font="0">temperature gauges. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="497" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All gas,&#34; Hallorann said. &#34;You've cooked with gas before, Wendy?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="65" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes.. &#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I love gas,&#34; he said, and turned on one of the burners. Blue flame popped </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">into life and he adjusted it down to a faint glow with a delicate touch. &#34;I like </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">to be able to see the flame you're cookin with. You see where all the surface </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="158" height="17" font="0">burner switches are?&#34; </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="57" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes.&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And the oven dials are all marked. Myself, I favor the middle one because it </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">seems to heat the most even, but you use whichever one you like — or all three, </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="121" height="17" font="0">for that matter.&#34; </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="454" height="17" font="0">  &#34;A TV dinner in each one,&#34; Wendy said, and laughed weakly. </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  For the next ten minutes Hallorann opened bins and doors, disclosing food in </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">such amounts as Wendy had never seen before. The food supplies amazed her but </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">did not reassure her as much as she might have thought: the Donner Party kept </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">other), but with the reinforced idea that this was indeed a serious business: </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">when snow fell, getting out of here would not be a matter of an hour's drive to </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">and listening to the bitter wind around their snowbound eaves. In Vermont, when </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="195" height="17" font="0">Danny had broken his arm </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">There were other numbers written on that little card. You could have a police </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">car in five minutes and a fire truck in even less time than that, because the </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">fire station was only three blocks away and one block over. There was a man to </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="201" height="17" font="0">  (oh God what a thought!) </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">  What if the place caught on fire? If Jack fell down the elevator shaft and </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="408" height="17" font="0">roasts of beef, ten roasts of pork, and a huge leg of lamb. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="360" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You like lamb, doc?&#34; Hallorann asked, grinning. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="418" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I love it,&#34; Danny said immediately. He had never had it. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I knew you did. There's nothin like two good slices of lamb on a cold night, </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">with some mint jelly on the side. You got the mint jelly here, too. Lamb eases </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="326" height="17" font="0">the belly. It's a noncontentious sort of meat.&#34; </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  From behind them Jack said curiously: &#34;How did you know we called him doc?&#34; </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Looks sort of like a doc, doesn't be?&#34; He wrinkled his nose at Danny, smacked </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="308" height="17" font="0">his lips, and said, &#34;Ehhhh, what's up, doc?&#34; </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="369" height="17" font="0">  Danny giggled and then Hallorann said something </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="328" height="17" font="0">  (Sure you don't want to go to Florida, doc?) </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  to him, very clearly. He heard every word. He looked at Hallorann, startled </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">and a little scared. Hallorann winked solemnly and turned back to the food. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  Wendy looked from the cook's broad, serge-clad back to her son. She had the </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You got twelve packages of sausage, twelve packages of bacon,&#34; Hallorann </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="492" height="17" font="0">said. &#34;So much for the pig. In this drawer, twenty pounds of butter.&#34; </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="197" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Real butter?&#34; Jack asked. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="171" height="17" font="0">  &#34;The A-number-one.&#34; </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't think I've had real butter since I was a kid back in Berlin, New </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, you'll eat it up here until oleo seems a treat,&#34; Hallorann said, and </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">laughed. &#34;Over in this bin you got your bread — thirty loaves of white, twenty of </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">dark. We try to keep racial balance at the Overlook, don't you know. Now I know </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">fifty loaves won't take you through, but there's plenty of makings and fresh is </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="287" height="17" font="0">better than frozen any day of the week. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="400" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Down here you got your fish. Brain food, right, doc?&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="108" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Is it, Mom?&#34; </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="337" height="17" font="0">  &#34;If Mr. Hallorann says so, honey.&#34; She smiled. </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  &#34;and five pounds of the sweetest-tasting sole that ever swam in the sea. My </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">were empty. The nuns who had been sitting by the fire were gone, and the fire </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">itself was down to a bed of comfortably glowing coals. Wendy glanced out into </text>

<text top="493" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">giant, battered old suitcases covered with black imitation alligator hide. The </text>
<text top="513" left="99" width="411" height="17" font="0">last was an oversized zipper bag with a faded tartan skin. </text>
<text top="533" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Guess you can handle that one, can't you?&#34; Hallorann asked him. He picked up </text>
<text top="553" left="99" width="500" height="17" font="0">two of the big cases in one hand and hoisted the other under his arm. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sure,&#34; Danny said. He got a grip on it with both hands and followed the cook </text>

<text top="935" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">&#34;You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I'm sixty </text>

<text top="995" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You got a knack,&#34; Hallorann said, turning to him. &#34;Me, I've always called it </text>
<text top="1015" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">shining. That's what my grandmother called it, too. She had it. We used to sit </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann smiled at Danny's openmouthed, almost hungry expression and said, </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">&#34;Come on up and sit in the car with me for a few minutes. Want to talk to you.&#34; </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">  In the lobby of the Overlook, Wendy Torrance saw her son get into the </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">wheel. A sharp pang of fear struck her and she opened her mouth to tell Jack </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">that Hallorann had not been lying about taking their son to Florida — there was a </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">kidnaping afoot. But they were only sitting there. She could barely see the </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">small silhouette of her son's head, turned attentively toward Hallorann's big </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">one. Even at this distance that small head had a set to it that she recognized — </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">it was the way her son looked when there was something on the TV that </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">particularly fascinated him, or when he and his father were playing old maid or </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">idiot cribbage. Jack, who was still looking around for Ullman, hadn't noticed. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">Wendy kept silent, watching Hallorann's car nervously, wondering what they could </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">possibly be talking about that would make Danny cock his head that way. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  In the car Hallorann was saying: &#34;Get you kinda lonely, thinkin you were the </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">  Danny, who had been frightened as well as lonely sometimes, nodded. &#34;Am I the </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="249" height="17" font="0">only one you ever met?&#34; he asked. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann laughed and shook his head. &#34;No, child, no. But you shine the </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="173" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Are there lots, then?&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No,&#34; Hallorann said, &#34;but you do run across them. A lot of folks, they got a </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">little bit of shine to them. They don't even know it. But they always seem to </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">show up with flowers when their wives are feelin blue with the monthlies, they </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">do good on school tests they don't even study for, they got a good idea how </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">people are feelin as soon as they walk into a room. I come across fifty or sixty </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">like that. But maybe only a dozen, countin my gram, that knew they was shinin.&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Wow,&#34; Danny said, and thought about it. Then: &#34;Do you know Mrs. Brant?&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Her?&#34; Hallorann asked scornfully. &#34;She don't shine. Just sends her supper </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I know she doesn't,&#34; Danny said earnestly. &#34;But do you know the man in the </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="344" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mike? Sure, I know Mike. What about him?&#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="361" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mr. Hallorann, why would she want his pants?&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="266" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What are you talking about, boy?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, when she was watching him, she was thinking she would sure like to get </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="318" height="17" font="0">into his pants and I just wondered why — &#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  But he got no further. Hallorann had thrown his head back, and rich, dark </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">laughter issued from his chest, rolling around in the car like cannonfire. The </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">seat shook with the force of it. Danny smiled, puzzled, and at last the storm </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">subsided by fits and starts. Hallorann produced a large silk handkerchief from </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">his breast pocket like a white flag of surrender and wiped his streaming eyes. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Boy,&#34; he said, still snorting a little, &#34;you are gonna know everything there </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="66" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Huh?&#34; </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Give me a blast. Think at me. I want to know if you got as much as I think </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="514" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Okay,&#34; Danny said. He considered it for a moment, then gathered his </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">concentration and flung it out at Hallorann. He had never done anything </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">precisely like this before, and at the last instant some instinctive part of him </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">rose up and blunted some of the thought's raw force-he didn't want to hurt Mr. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">Hallorann. Still the thought arrowed out of him with a force he never would have </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="484" height="17" font="0">believed. It went like a Nolan Ryan fastball with a little extra on it. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="227" height="17" font="0">  (Gee I hope I don't hurt him) </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="170" height="17" font="0">  And the thought was: </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="268" height="17" font="0">                               (!!! HI, DICK!!!) </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann winced and jerked backward on the seat. His teeth came together </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">with a hard click, drawing blood from his lower lip in a thin trickle. His hands </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">flew up involuntarily from his lap to the level of his chest and then settled </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">back again. For a moment his eyelids fluttered limply, with no conscious </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="255" height="17" font="0">control, and Danny was frightened. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="289" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mr. Hallorann? Dick? Are you okay?&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't know,&#34; Hallorann said, and laughed weakly. &#34;I honest to God don't. My </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'm sorry,&#34; Danny said, more alarmed. &#34;Should I get my daddy? I'll run and </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="69" height="17" font="0">get him.&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, here I come. I'm okay, Danny. You just sit right there. I feel a little </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="155" height="17" font="0">scrambled, that's all.&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I didn't go as hard as I could,&#34; Danny confessed. &#34;I was scared to, at the </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="95" height="17" font="0">last minute.&#34; </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Probably my good luck you did ... my brains would be leakin out my ears.&#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">He saw the alarm on Danny's face and smiled. &#34;No harm done. What did it feel </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="95" height="17" font="0">like to you?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="483" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Like I was Nolan Ryan throwing a fastball,&#34; he replied promptly. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You like baseball, do you?&#34; Hallorann was rubbing his temples gingerly. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Daddy and me like the Angels,&#34; Danny said. &#34;The Red Sox in the American </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">League East and the Angels in the West. We saw the Red Sox against Cincinnati in </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">the World Series. I was a lot littler then. And Daddy was ...&#34; Danny's face </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="178" height="17" font="0">went dark and troubled. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="144" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Was what, Dan?&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I forget,&#34; Danny said. He started to put his thumb in his mouth to suck it, </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="419" height="17" font="0">but that was a baby trick. He put his hand back in his lap. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Can you tell what your mom and dad are thinking, Danny?&#34; Hallorann was </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="98" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Why not?&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well ...&#34; he paused a moment, troubled. &#34;It would be like peeking into the </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">bedroom and watching while they're doing the thing that makes babies. Do you </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="133" height="17" font="0">know that thing?&#34; </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="421" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I have had acquaintance with it,&#34; Hallorann said gravely. </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  &#34;They wouldn't like that. And they wouldn't like me peeking at their thinks. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="137" height="17" font="0">It would be dirty.&#34; </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But I know how they're feeling,&#34; Danny said. &#34;I can't help that. I know how </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="295" height="17" font="0">you're feeling, too. I hurt you. I'm sorry.&#34; </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's just a headache. I've had hangovers that were worse. Can you read other </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="122" height="17" font="0">people, Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I can't read yet at all,&#34; Danny said, &#34;except a few words. But Daddy's going </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">to teach me this winter. My daddy used to teach reading and writing in a big </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="370" height="17" font="0">school. Mostly writing, but he knows reading, too.&#34; </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="360" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I mean, can you tell what anybody is thinking?&#34; </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="187" height="17" font="0">  Danny thought about it. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I can if it's loud,&#34; he said finally. &#34;Like Mrs. Brant and the pants. Or like </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">once, when me and Mommy were in this big store to get me some shoes, there was </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">this big kid looking at radios, and he was thinking about taking one without </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">buying it. Then he'd think, what if I get caught? Then he'd think, I really want </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">it. Then he'd think about getting caught again. He was making himself sick about </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">it, and he was making me sick. Mommy was talking to the man who sells the shoes </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">so I went over and said, `Kid, don't take that radio. Go away.' And he got </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="244" height="17" font="0">really scared. He went away fast.&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann was grinning broadly. &#34;I bet he did. Can you do anything else, </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="418" height="17" font="0">Danny? Is it only thoughts and feelings, or is there more?&#34; </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="271" height="17" font="0">  Cautiously: &#34;Is there more for you?&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sometimes,&#34; Hallorann said. &#34;Not often. Sometimes ... sometimes there are </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="236" height="17" font="0">dreams. Do you dream, Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="618" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sometimes,&#34; Danny said, &#34;I dream when I'm awake. After Tony comes.&#34; His thumb </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="623" height="17" font="0">wanted to go into his mouth again. He had never told anyone but Mommy and Daddy </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="487" height="17" font="0">about Tony. He made his thumb-sucking hand go back into his lap. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="122" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Who's Tony?&#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  And suddenly Danny had one of those flashes of understanding that frightened </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">him most of all; it was like a sudden glimpse of some incomprehensible machine </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="606" height="17" font="0">that might be safe or might be deadly dangerous. He was too young to know which. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="242" height="17" font="0">He was too young to understand. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What's wrong?&#34; he cried. &#34;You're asking me all this because you're worried, </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">aren't you? Why are you worried about me? Why are you worried about us?&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann put his large dark hands on the small boy's shoulders. &#34;Stop,&#34; he </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">said. &#34;It's probably nothin. But if it is somethin ... well, you've got a large </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="714" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But I don't understand things!&#34; Danny burst out. &#34;I do but I don't! People ... they feel things and I </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mommy and Daddy call him my `invisible playmate, '&#34; Danny said, reciting the </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">words carefully. &#34;But he's really real. At least, I think he is. Sometimes, when </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">I try real hard to understand things, he comes. He says, 'Danny, I want to show </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">you something.' And it's like I pass out. Only ... there are dreams, like you </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="707" height="17" font="0">said.&#34; He looked at Hallorann and swallowed. &#34;They used to be nice. But now ...  I can't remember </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="399" height="17" font="0">the word for dreams that scare you and make you cry.&#34; </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="240" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nightmares?&#34; Hallorann asked. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="238" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes. That's right. Nightmares.&#34; </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="312" height="17" font="0">  &#34;About this place? About the Overlook?&#34; </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">  Danny looked down at his thumb-sucking hand again. &#34;Yes,&#34; he whispered. Then </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">he spoke shrilly, looking up into Hallorann's face: &#34;But I can't tell my daddy, </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">and you can't, either! He has to have this job because it's the only one Uncle </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">it's when he used to always be drunk and that was a Bad Thing to do!&#34; He </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="220" height="17" font="0">stopped, on the verge of tears. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Shh,&#34; Hallorann said, and pulled Danny's face against the rough serge of his </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="509" height="17" font="0">jacket. It smelled faintly of mothballs. &#34;That's all right, son. And if that </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">thumb likes your mouth, let it go where it wants.&#34; But his face was troubled. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  He said: &#34;What you got, son, I call it shinin on, the Bible calls it having </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="514" height="17" font="0">visions, and there's scientists that call it precognition. I've read up on it, </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">son. I've studied on it. They all mean seeing the future. Do you understand </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="46" height="17" font="0">that?&#34; </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="296" height="17" font="0">  Danny nodded against Hallorann's coat. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I remember the strongest shine I ever had that way ... I'm not liable to </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">forget. It was 1955. I was still in the Army then, stationed overseas in West </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">Germany. It was an hour before supper, and I was standin by the sink, givin one </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">of the KPs hell for takin too much of the potato along with the peel. I says, </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">'Here, lemme show you how that's done.' He held out the potato and the peeler </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">and then the whole kitchen was gone. Bang, just like that. You say you see this </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="327" height="17" font="0">guy Tony before ... before you have dreams?&#34; </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="123" height="17" font="0">  Danny nodded. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann put an arm around him. &#34;With me it's smellin oranges. All that </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">afternoon I'd been smellin them and thinkin nothin of it, because they were on </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">the menu for that night—we had thirty crates of Valencias. Everybody in the damn </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="282" height="17" font="0">kitchen was smellin oranges that night. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  &#34;For a minute it was like I had just passed out. And then I heard an explosion </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">and saw flames. There were people screaming. Sirens. And I heard this hissin </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">noise that could only be steam. Then it seemed like I got a little closer to </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">whatever it was and I saw a railroad car off the tracks and laying on its side </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">with Georgia aced South Carolina Railroad written on it, and I knew like a flash </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">that my brother Carl was on that train and it jumped the tracks and Carl was </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">dead. Just like that. Then it was gone and here's this scared, stupid little KP </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">in front of me, still holdin out that potato and the peeler. He says, 'Are you </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">okay, Sarge?' And I says, `No. My brother's just been killed down in Georgia' </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="35" height="17" font="0">was. </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="314" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But see, boy, I already knew how it was.&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  He shook his head slowly, as if dismissing the memory, and looked down at the </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="114" height="17" font="0">wide-eyed boy. </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But the thing you got to remember, my boy, is this: Those things don't always </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">come true. I remember just four years ago I had a job cookin at a boys' camp up </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">in Maine on Long Lake. So I am sittin by the boarding gate at Logan Airport in </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">Boston, just waiting to get on my flight, and I start to smell oranges. For the </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">first time in maybe five years. So I say to myself, 'My God, what's comin on </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">this crazy late show now?' and I got down to the bathroom and sat on one of the </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">toilets to be private. I never did black out, but I started to get this feelin, </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">stronger and stronger, that my plane was gonna crash. Then the feeling went </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">away, and the smell of oranges, and I knew it was over. I went back to the Delta </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">Airlines desk and changed my flight to one three hours later. And do you know </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="129" height="17" font="0">what happened?&#34; </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="209" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What?&#34; Danny whispered. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nothin!&#34; Hallorann said, and laughed. He was relieved to see the boy smile a </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">little, too. &#34;Not one single thing! That old plane landed right on time and </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">without a single bump or bruise. So you see ... sometimes those feelins don't </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="139" height="17" font="0">come to anything.&#34; </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="141" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Oh,&#34; Danny said. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Or you take the race track. I go a lot, and I usually do pretty well. I stand </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">by the rail when they go by the starting gate, and sometimes I get a little </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">shine about this horse or that one. Usually those feelins help me get real well. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">I always tell myself that someday I'm gonna get three at once on three long </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">shots and make enough on the trifecta to retire early. It ain't happened yet. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">But there's plenty of times I've come home from the track on shank's mare </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">instead of in a taxicab with my wallet swollen up. Nobody shines on all the </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="316" height="17" font="0">time, except maybe for God up in heaven.&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Danny said, thinking of the time almost a year ago when Tony had </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">showed him a new baby lying in a crib at their house in Stovington. He had been </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">very excited about that, and had waited, knowing that it took time, but there </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="170" height="17" font="0">had been no new baby. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now you listen,&#34; Hallorann said, and took both of Danny's hands in his own. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">&#34;I've had some bad dreams here, and I've had some bad feelins. I've worked here </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">two seasons now and maybe a dozen times I've had ... well, nightmares. And </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">maybe half a dozen times I've thought I've seen things. No, I won't say what. It </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">ain't for a little boy like you. Just nasty things. Once it had something to do </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">with those damn hedges clipped to look like animals. Another time there was a </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">maid, Delores Vickery her name was, and she had a little shine to her, but I </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">don't think she knew it. Mr. Ullman fired her ... do you know what that is, </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="44" height="17" font="0">doc?&#34; </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Danny said candidly, &#34;my daddy got fired from his teaching job and </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="277" height="17" font="0">that's why we're in Colorado, I guess.&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, Ullman fired her on account of her saying she'd seen something in one </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">of the rooms where ... well, where a bad thing happened. That was in Room 217, </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">and I want you to promise me you won't go in there, Danny. Not all winter. Steer </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All right,&#34; Danny said. &#34;Did the lady — the maiden — did she ask you to go </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="49" height="17" font="0">look?&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, she did. And there was a bad thing there. But ... I don't think it was </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">a bad thing that could hurt anyone, Danny, that's what I'm tryin to say. People </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">who shine can sometimes see things that are gonna happen, and I think sometimes </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">they can see things that did happen. But they're just like pictures in a book. </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="447" height="17" font="0">Did you ever see a picture in a book that scared you, Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; he said, thinking of the story of Bluebeard and the picture where </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="430" height="17" font="0">Bluebeard's new wife opens the door and sees all the heads. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="361" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But you knew it couldn't hurt you, didn't you?&#34; </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="308" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Ye — ess...&#34; Danny said, a little dubious. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, that's how it is in this hotel. I don't know why, but it seems that all </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">the bad things that ever happened here, there's little pieces of those things </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">still layin around like fingernail clippins or the boogers that somebody nasty </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">just wiped under a chair. I don't know why it should just be here, there's bad </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">goings-on in just about every hotel in the world, I guess, and I've worked in a </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">lot of them and had no trouble. Only here. But Danny, I don't think those things </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">can hurt anybody.&#34; He emphasized each word in the sentence with a mild shake of </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">the boy's shoulders. &#34;So if you should see something, in a hallway or a room or </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">outside by those hedges ... just look the other way and when you look back, </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="242" height="17" font="0">it'll be gone. Are you diggin me?&#34; </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; Danny said. He felt much better, soothed. He got up on his knees, </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">kissed Hallorann's cheek, and gave him a big hard hug. Hallorann hugged him </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="42" height="17" font="0">back. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  When he released the boy he asked: &#34;Your folks, they don't shine, do they?&#34; </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="171" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, I don't think so.&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I tried them like I did you,&#34; Hallorann said. &#34;Your momma jumped the tiniest </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="507" height="17" font="0">bit. I think all mothers shine a little, you know, at least until their kids </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="425" height="17" font="0">grow up enough to watch out for themselves. Your dad ...&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann paused momentarily. He had probed at the boy's father and he just </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">didn't know. It wasn't like meeting someone who had the shine, or someone who </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">definitely did not. Poking at Danny's father had been ... strange, as if Jack </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="717" height="17" font="0">Torrance had something – something that he was hiding. Or something he was holding in so deeply </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="388" height="17" font="0">submerged in himself that it was impossible to get to. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't think he shines at all,&#34; Hallorann finished. &#34;So you don't worry </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">about them. You just take care of you. I don't think there's anything here that </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="264" height="17" font="0">can hurt you. So just be cool, okay?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="69" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Okay.&#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="153" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny! Hey, doc!&#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="482" height="17" font="0">  Danny looked around. &#34;That's Mom. She wants me. I have to go.&#34; </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I know you do,&#34; Hallorann said. &#34;You have a good time here, Danny. Best you </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="101" height="17" font="0">can, anyway.&#34; </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="367" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I will. Thanks, Mr. Hallorann. I feel a lot better.&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="291" height="17" font="0">  The smiling thought came in his mind: </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="295" height="17" font="0">  (Dick, to my friends) (Yes, Dick, okay) </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="333" height="17" font="0">  Their eyes met, and Dick Hallorann winked. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  Danny scrambled across the seat of the car and opened the passenger side door. </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">hurriedly. Jack was over by the window just outside the restaurant, studying the </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  The cash register apparently checked out, because now Ullman ran it shut with </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">petty tyrant when he was backstage with the help. But now school was out and the </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">head clerk's pleasure was written large on his face. It was out for everyone but </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mr. Torrance,&#34; Ullman called peremptorily. &#34;Would you come over here, please?&#34; </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  Jack walked over, nodding to Wendy and Danny that they were to come too. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">  The clerk, who had gone into the back, now came out again wearing an overcoat. </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="513" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I doubt it,&#34; Ullman said distantly. &#34;May twelfth, Braddock. Not a day </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="82" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  Braddock walked around the desk, his face sober and dignified, as befitted his </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">position, but when his back was entirely to Ullman, he grinned like a schoolboy. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">He spoke briefly to the two girls still waiting by the door for their ride, and </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="399" height="17" font="0">he was followed out by a brief burst of stifled laughter. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  Now Wendy began to notice the silence of the place. It had fallen over the </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="509" height="17" font="0">hotel like a heavy blanket muting everything but the faint pulse of the </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">afternoon wind outside. From where she stood she could look through the inner </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">office, now neat to the point of sterility with its two bare desks and two sets </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">of gray filing cabinets. Beyond that she could see Hallorann's spotless kitchen, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="470" height="17" font="0">the big portholed double doors propped open by rubber wedges. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I thought I would take a few extra minutes and show you through the Hotel,&#34; </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">Ullman said, and Wendy reflected that you could always hear that capital H in </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">Ullman's voice. You were supposed to hear it. &#34;I'm sure your husband will get to </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">know the ins and outs of the Overlook quite well, Mrs. Torrance, but you and </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">your son will doubtless keep more to the lobby level and the first floor, where </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="136" height="17" font="0">your quarters are.&#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Doubtless,&#34; Wendy murmured demurely, and Jack shot her a private glance. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's a beautiful place,&#34; Ullman said expansively. &#34;I rather enjoy showing it </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="240" height="17" font="0">  I'll bet you do, Wendy thought. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Let's go up to third and work our way down,&#34; Ullman said. He sounded </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="147" height="17" font="0">positively enthused. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="285" height="17" font="0">  &#34;If we're keeping you — &#34; Jack began. </text>
<text top="1016" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Not at all,&#34; Ullman said: &#34;The shop is shut. <i>Tout fins</i>, for this season, at </text>
<text top="1036" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">least. And I plan to overnight in Boulder — at the Boulderado, of course. Only </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">  They stepped into the elevator together. It was ornately scrolled in copper </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">and brass, but it settled appreciably before Ullman pulled the gate across. </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">Danny stirred a little uneasily, and Ullman smiled down at him. Danny tried to </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="260" height="17" font="0">smile back without notable success. </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="442" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't you worry, little man,&#34; Ullman said. &#34;Safe as houses.&#34; </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="516" height="17" font="0">  &#34;So was the Titanic,&#34; Jack said, looking up at the cut-glass globe in the </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">center of the elevator ceiling. Wendy bit the inside of her cheek to keep the </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  Ullman was not amused. He slid the inner gate across with a rattle and a bang. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">&#34;The Titanic made only one voyage, Mr. Torrance. This elevator has made </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="354" height="17" font="0">thousands of them since it was installed in 1926.&#34; </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;That's reassuring,&#34; Jack said. He ruffed Danny's hair. &#34;The plane ain't gonna </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="85" height="17" font="0">crash, doc.&#34; </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">  Ullman threw the lever over, and for a moment there was nothing but a </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">shuddering beneath their feet and the tortured whine of the motor below them. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">Wendy had a vision of the four of them being trapped between floors like flies </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="503" height="17" font="0">in a bottle and found in the spring ... with little bits and pieces gone ... </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="175" height="17" font="0">like the Donner Party ... </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="80" height="17" font="0">  (Stop it!) </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  The elevator began to rise, with some vibration and clashing and banging from </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">below at first. Then the ride smoothed out. At the third floor Ullman brought </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">them to a bumpy stop, retracted the gate, and opened the door. The elevator car </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">was still six inches below floor level. Danny gazed at the difference in height </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">between the third-floor hall and the elevator floor as if he had just sensed the </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">universe was not as sane as he had been told. Ullman cleared his throat and </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="499" height="17" font="0">raised the car a little, brought it to a stop with a jerk (still two inches </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">low), and they all climbed out. With their weight gone the car rebounded almost </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">to floor level, something Wendy did not find reassuring at all. Safe as houses </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">or not, she resolved to take the stairs when she had to go up or down in this </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">place. And under no conditions would she allow the three of them to get into the </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="163" height="17" font="0">rickety thing together. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What are you looking at, doc?&#34; Jack inquired humorously. &#34;See any spots </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="55" height="17" font="0">there?&#34; </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Of course not,&#34; Ullman said, nettled. &#34;All the rugs were shampooed just two </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="74" height="17" font="0">days ago.&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  Wendy glanced down at the hall runner herself. Pretty, but definitely not </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">anything she would choose for her own home, if the day ever came when she had </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">one. Deep blue pile, it was entwined with what seemed to be a surrealistic </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">jungle scene full of ropes and vines and trees filled with exotic birds. It was </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">hard to tell just what sort of birds, because all the interweaving was done in </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="286" height="17" font="0">unshaded black, giving only silhouettes. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="331" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Do you like the rug?&#34; Wendy asked Danny. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="240" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, Mom,&#34; he said colorlessly. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="605" height="17" font="0">  They walked down the hall, which was comfortably wide. The wallpaper was silk, </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="516" height="17" font="0">a lighter blue to go against the rug. Electric flambeaux stood at ten-foot </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">intervals at a height of about seven feet. Fashioned to look like London gas </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="162" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It sure is,&#34; Jack said. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  The window ran nearly the length of the sitting room, and beyond it the sun </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">was poised directly between two sawtoothed peaks, casting golden light across </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  Jack and Wendy were so absorbed in the view that they didn't look down at </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">Danny, who was staring not out the window but at the red-and-white-striped silk </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">wallpaper to the left, where a door opened into an interior bedroom. And his </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">gasp, which had been mingled with theirs, had nothing to do with beauty. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  Great splashes of dried blood, flecked with tiny bits of grayish-white tissue, </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">clotted the wallpaper. It made Danny feel sick. It was like a crazy picture </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">drawn in blood, a surrealistic etching of a man's face drawn back in terror and </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="421" height="17" font="0">pain, the mouth yawning and half the head pulverized —  </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  (So if you should see something ... just look the other way and when you </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="320" height="17" font="0">look back, it'll be gone. Are you diggin me?) </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  He deliberately looked out the window, being careful to show no expression on </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">his face, and when his mommy's hand closed over his own he took it, being </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="404" height="17" font="0">careful not to squeeze it or give her a signal of any kind. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  The manager was saying something to his daddy about making sure to shutter </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">that big window so a strong wind wouldn't blow it in. Jack was nodding. Danny </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">looked cautiously back at the wall. The big dried bloodstain was gone. Those </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">little gray-white flecks that had been scattered all through it, they were gone, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="32" height="17" font="0">too. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="622" height="17" font="0">  Then Ullman was leading them out. Mommy asked him if he thought the mountains </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="495" height="17" font="0">were pretty. Danny said he did, although he didn't really care for the </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">mountains, one way or the other. As Ullman was closing the door behind them, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">Danny looked back over his shoulder. The bloodstain had returned, only now it </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">was fresh. It was running. Ullman, looking directly at it, went on with his </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="611" height="17" font="0">running commentary about the famous men who had stayed here. Danny discovered </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">that he had bitten his lip hard enough to make it bleed, and he had never even </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">felt it. As they walked on down the corridor, he fell a little bit behind the </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">others and wiped the blood away with the back of his hand and thought about </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="68" height="17" font="0">  (blood) </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="432" height="17" font="0">  (Did Mr. Hallorann see blood or was it something worse?) </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="306" height="17" font="0">  (I don't think those things can hurt you.) </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  There was an iron scream behind his lips, but he would not let it out. His </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">mommy and daddy could not see such things; they never had. He would keep quiet. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">His mommy and daddy were loving each other, and that was a real thing. The other </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">things were just like pictures in a book. Some pictures were scary, but they </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  Mr. Ullman showed them some other rooms on the third floor, leading them </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="620" height="17" font="0">man named Arthur Miller (Danny got a vague understanding that Marilyn and Arthur </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  &#34;If they were married, why did they have different names? You and Daddy have </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, but we're not famous, Danny,&#34; Jack said. &#34;Famous women keep their same </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">names even after they get married because their names are their bread and </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="398" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Bread and butter,&#34; Danny said, completely mystified. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What Daddy means is that people used to like to go to the movies and see </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">Marilyn Monroe,&#34; Wendy said, &#34;but they might not like to go to see Marilyn </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Why not? She'd still be the same lady. Wouldn't everyone know that?&#34; </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="328" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, but — &#34; She looked at Jack helplessly. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Truman Capote once stayed in this room,&#34; Ullman interrupted impatiently. He </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">opened the door. &#34;That was in my time. An awfully nice man. Continental </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="75" height="17" font="0">manners.&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  There was nothing remarkable in any of these rooms (except for the absence of </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">sweets, which Mr. Ullman kept calling them), nothing that Danny was afraid of. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">In fact, there was only one other thing on the third floor that bothered Danny, </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">and he could not have said why. It was the fire extinguisher on the wall just </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">before they turned the corner and went back to the elevator, which stood open </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="303" height="17" font="0">and waiting like a mouthful of gold teeth. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">  It was an old-fashioned extinguisher, a flat hose folded back a dozen times </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">upon itself, one end attached to a large red valve, the other ending in a brass </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">nozzle. The folds of the hose were secured with a red steel slat on a hinge. In </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">case of a fire you could knock the steel slat up and out of the way with one </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">hard push and the hose was yours. Danny could see that much; he was good at </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">seeing how things worked. By the time he was two and a half he had been </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">unlocking the protective gate his father had installed at the top of the stairs </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">in the Stovington house. He had seen how the lock worked. His daddy said it was </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="460" height="17" font="0">a NACK. Some people had the NACK and some people didn't. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  This fire extinguisher was a little older than others he had seen — the one in </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">the nursery school, for instance — but that was not so unusual. Nonetheless it </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">filled him with faint unease, curled up there against the light blue wallpaper </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">like a sleeping snake. And he was glad when it was out of sight around the </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="54" height="17" font="0">corner. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Of course all the windows have to be shuttered,&#34; Mr. Ullman said as they </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">stepped back into the elevator. Once again the car sank queasily beneath their </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">feet. &#34;But I'm particularly concerned about the one in the Presidential Suite. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">The original bill on that window was four hundred and twenty dollars, and that </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">was over thirty years ago. It would cost eight times that to replace today.&#34; </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="612" height="17" font="0">  They went down to the second floor where there were more rooms and even more </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">twists and turns in the corridor. The light from the windows had begun to fade </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="627" height="17" font="0">appreciably now as the sun went behind the mountains. Mr. Ullman showed them one </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">or two rooms and that was all. He walked past 217, the one Dick Hallorann had </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="615" height="17" font="0">warned him about, without slowing. Danny looked at the bland number-plate on the </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">  Then down to the first floor. Mr. Ullman didn't show them into any rooms here </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">until they had almost reached the thickly carpeted staircase that led down into </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">the lobby again. &#34;Here are your quarters,&#34; he said. &#34;I think you'll find them </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">  They went in. Danny was braced for whatever might be there. There was nothing. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  Wendy Torrance felt a strong surge of relief. The Presidential Suite, with its </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">cold elegance, had made her feel awkward and clumsy — it was all very well to </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">visit some restored historical building with a bedroom plaque that announced </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">Abraham Lincoln or Franklin D. Roosevelt had slept there, but another thing </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">entirely to imagine you and your husband lying beneath acreages of linen and </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">inviting. She thought she could abide this place for a season with no great </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="74" height="17" font="0">difficulty. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="509" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's very pleasant,&#34; she said to Ullman, and heard the gratitude in her </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="46" height="17" font="0">voice. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  Ullman nodded. &#34;Simple but adequate. During the season, this suite quarters </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="395" height="17" font="0">the cook and his wife, or the cook and his apprentice.&#34; </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="330" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mr. Hallorann lived here?&#34; Danny broke in. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  Mr. Ullman inclined his head to Danny condescendingly. &#34;Quite so. He and Mr. </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  There were several chairs that looked comfortable but not expensive, a coffee </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">table that had once been expensive but now had a long chip gone from the side, </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">two bookcases (stuffed full of Reader's Digest Condensed Books and Detective </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">Book Club trilogies from the forties, Wendy saw with some amusement), and an </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">anonymous hotel TV that looked much less elegant than the buffed wood consoles </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="99" height="17" font="0">in the rooms. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No kitchen, of course,&#34; Ullman said, &#34;but there is a dumb-waiter. This </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">apartment is directly over the kitchen.&#34; He slid aside a square of paneling and </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">disclosed a wide, squarer tray. He gave it a push and it disappeared, trailing </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="110" height="17" font="0">rope behind it. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's a secret passage!&#34; Danny said excitedly to his mother, momentarily </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">forgetting all fears in favor of that intoxicating shaft behind the wall. &#34;Just </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="354" height="17" font="0">like in Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters!&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">  Mr. Ullman frowned but Wendy smiled indulgently. Danny ran over to the dumb- </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="254" height="17" font="0">waiter and peered down the shaft., </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="148" height="17" font="0">  &#34;This way, please.&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  He opened the door on the far side of the living room. It gave on the bedroom, </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">which was spacious and airy. There were twin beds. Wendy looked at her husband, </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="127" height="17" font="0">smiled, shrugged. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="396" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No problem,&#34; Jack said. &#34;We'll push them together.&#34; </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="465" height="17" font="0">  &#34;The beds,&#34; Jack said pleasantly. &#34;We can push them together.&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Oh, quite,&#34; Ullman said, momentarily confused. Then his face cleared and a </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">red flush began to creep up from the collar of his shirt. &#34;Whatever you like.&#34; </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">  He led them back into the sitting room, where a second door opened on a second </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">bedroom, this one equipped with bunk beds. A radiator clanked in one corner, and </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="606" height="17" font="0">the rug on the floor was a hideous embroidery of western sage and cactus — Danny </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">bad already fallen in love with it, Wendy saw. The walls of this smaller room </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="189" height="17" font="0">were paneled in real pine. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="367" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Think you can stand it in here, doc?&#34; Jack asked. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="403" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sure I can. I'm going to sleep in the top bunk. Okay?&#34; </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="197" height="17" font="0">  &#34;If that's what you want.&#34; </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I like the rug, too. Mr. Ullman, why don't you have all the rugs like that?&#34; </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  Mr. Ullman looked for a moment as if he had sunk his teeth into a lemon. Then </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">he smiled and patted Danny's head. &#34;Those are your quarters,&#34; he said, &#34;except </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">for the bath, which opens off the main bedroom. It's not a huge apartment, but </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="499" height="17" font="0">of course you'll have the rest of the hotel to spread out in. The lobby </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">fireplace is in good working order, or so Watson tells me, and you must feel </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">free to eat in the dining room if the spirit moves you to do so.&#34; He spoke in </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="306" height="17" font="0">the tone of a man conferring a great favor. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="161" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All right,&#34; Jack said. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="297" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Shall we go down?&#34; Mr. Ullman asked. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="154" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Fine,&#34; Wendy said. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">  They went downstairs in the elevator, and now the lobby was wholly deserted </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'm pleased,&#34; Wendy said, and thought it would sound absurd. It didn't. She </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">had come out here from New England, where she had spent her life, and it seemed </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">to her that in a few short sentences this man Watson, with his fluffy fringe of </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">hair, had epitomized what the West was supposed to be all about. And never mind </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Young master Torrance,&#34; Watson said gravely, and put out his hand. Danny, who </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">had known all about handshaking for almost a year now, put his own hand out </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="487" height="17" font="0">gingerly and felt it swallowed up. &#34;You take good care of em, Dan.&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="82" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  Watson let go of Danny's hand and straightened up fully. He looked at Ullman. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="407" height="17" font="0">&#34;Until next year, I guess,&#34; he said, and held his hand out. </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="135" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Good-by, then.&#34; </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  He walked quickly and prissily across to his car—a ridiculously big one for </text>

<text top="412" left="236" width="431" height="17" font="0">and tucked himself into it. The Lincoln's motor purred into </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">life and the taillights flashed as he pulled out of his parking stall. As the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">car moved away, Jack could read the small sign at the head of the stall: </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="302" height="17" font="0">RESERVED FOR MR. ULLMAN, MGR. </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="184" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Right,&#34; Jack said softly. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  They watched until the car was out of sight, headed down the eastern slope. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">When it was gone, the three of them looked at each other for a silent, almost </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">frightened moment. They were alone. Aspen leaves whirled and skittered in </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">aimless packs across the lawn that was now neatly mowed and tended for no </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">guest's eyes. There was no one to see the autumn leaves steal across the grass </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">but the three of them. It gave Jack a curious shrinking feeling, as if his life </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">force had dwindled to a mere spark while the hotel and the grounds had suddenly </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">doubled in size and become sinister, dwarfing them with sullen, inanimate power. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  Then Wendy said: &#34;Look at you, doc. Your nose is running like a fire hose. </text>

<text top="453" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">be bad; the nest was between him and his ladder, and the trapdoor leading down </text>
<text top="473" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">into the attic was locked from the inside. The drop was seventy feet from the </text>
<text top="493" left="99" width="418" height="17" font="0">roof to the cement patio between the hotel and the lawn. </text>
<text top="513" left="99" width="400" height="17" font="0">  The clear air above the nest was still and undisturbed. </text>
<text top="533" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  Jack whistled disgustedly between his teeth, sat straddling the peak of the </text>
<text top="553" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">roof, and examined his right index finger. It was swelling already, and he </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">supposed he would have to try and creep past that nest to his ladder so he could </text>

<text top="614" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">  It was October 20. Wendy and Danny had gone down to Sidewinder in the hotel </text>
<text top="634" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">truck (an elderly, rattling Dodge that was still more trustworthy than the VW, </text>
<text top="654" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">which was now wheezing gravely and seemed terminal) to get three gallons of milk </text>
<text top="674" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">and do some Christmas shopping. It was early to shop, but there was no telling </text>
<text top="694" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">when the snow would come to stay. There had already been flurries, and in some </text>
<text top="714" left="99" width="478" height="17" font="0">places the road down from the Overlook was slick with patch ice. </text>
<text top="734" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  So far the fall had been almost preternaturally beautiful. In the three weeks </text>
<text top="754" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">they had been here, golden day had followed golden day. Crisp, thirty-degree </text>
<text top="774" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">mornings gave way to afternoon temperatures in the low sixties, the perfect </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">and doing the shingling. Jack had admitted freely to Wendy that he could have </text>
<text top="835" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">finished the job four days ago, but he felt no real urge to hurry. The view from </text>

<text top="875" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">the shade. More important, the work itself was soothing. On the roof he felt </text>
<text top="895" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">himself healing from the troubled wounds of the last three years. On the roof he </text>
<text top="915" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">felt at peace. Those three years began to seem like a turbulent nightmare. </text>
<text top="935" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  The shingles had been badly rotted, some of them blown entirely away by last </text>
<text top="955" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">winter's storms. He had ripped them all up, yelling &#34;Bombs away!&#34; as he dropped </text>
<text top="975" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">them over the side, not wanting Danny to get hit in case he had wandered over. </text>
<text top="995" left="99" width="500" height="17" font="0">He had been pulling out bad flashing when the wasp had gotten him. </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  Tall and shaggily blond, George had been an almost insolently beautiful boy. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">In his tight faded jeans and Stovington sweatshirt with the sleeves carelessly </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">pushed up to the elbows to disclose his tanned forearms, he had reminded Jack of </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="623" height="17" font="0">a young Robert Redford, and he doubted that George had much trouble scoring — no </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">more than that young footballplaying devil Jack Torrance had ten years earlier. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">He could say that he honestly didn't feel jealous of George, or envy him his </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">good looks; in fact, he had almost unconsciously begun to visualize George as </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">the physical incarnation of his play hero, Gary Benson — the perfect foil for the </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">dark, slumped, and aging Denker, who grew to hate Gary so much. But he, Jack </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">Torrance, had never felt that way about George. If he had, he would have known </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="209" height="17" font="0">it. He was quite sure of that. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  George had floated through his classes at Stovington. A soccer and baseball </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">star, his academic program had been fairly undemanding and he had been content </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">with C's and an occasional B in history or botany. He was a fierce field </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">contender but a lackadaisical, amused sort of student in the classrooms. Jack was </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">familiar with the type, more from his own days as a high school and college </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">student than from his teaching experience, which was at second hand. George </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">Hatfield was a jock. He could be a calm, undemanding figure in the classroom, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">but when the right set of competitive stimuli was applied (like electrodes to </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">the temples of Frankenstein's monster, Jack thought wryly), he could become a </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="83" height="17" font="0">juggernaut. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  In January, George had tried out with two dozen others for the debate team. He </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">had been quite frank with Jack. His father was a corporation lawyer, and he </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. George, who felt no burning call to </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">do anything else, was willing. His grades were not top end, but this was, after </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">all, only prep school and it was still early times. If should be came to must </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">be, his father could pull some strings. George's own athletic ability would open </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">still other doors. But Brian Hatfield thought his son should get on the debate </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">team. It was good practice, and it was something that law-school admissions </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">boards always looked for. So George went out for debate, and in late March Jack </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="173" height="17" font="0">cut him from the team. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  The late winter inter-squad debates had fired George Hatfield's competitive </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">soul. He became a grimly determined debater, prepping his pro or con position </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="489" height="17" font="0">fiercely. It didn't matter if the subject was legalization of marijuana, </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">certainly not on the Stovington playing fields, where talk was not a virtue and </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">they sometimes even threw you out of the game for too much discussion. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">  When George got tightly wound up in a debate, the stutter would come out. The </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="421" height="17" font="0">others had filed out, and then had confronted Jack angrily. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="215" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You s-set the timer ahead.&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">  Jack looked up from the papers he was putting back into his briefcase. </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">stood there, feeling, rather than hearing, the echo of George's Adidas in the </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">empty hall. Still in the grip of his temper and his shame at mocking George's </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="511" height="17" font="0">stutter, his first thought had been a sick sort of exultation: For the first </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">time in his life George Hatfield had wanted something he could not have. For the </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">first time there was something wrong that all of Daddy's money could not fix. </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">needle in a defective groove. Then the exultation was simply buried in shame, </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="439" height="17" font="0">and he felt the way he had after he had broken Danny's arm. </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  Ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. He envied George Hatfield nothing. If the truth </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="427" height="17" font="0">  But he hadn't set the timer ahead. He was quite sure of it. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">  A week later he had cut him, and that time he had kept his temper. The shouts </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">and the threats had all been on George's side. A week after that he had gone out </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  And the next thing was Miss Strong, the French teacher, holding Jack's arms, </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">together by the door, staring at George. There was blood on his face from a </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">cabinet above the washbasin. The expression on his face was one of drugged </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">horror, and her first thought was that he was having some sort of epileptic </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="361" height="17" font="0">seizure, that he might have swallowed his tongue. </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Jack shook him again, and Danny's eyes suddenly cleared. His toothbrush fell </text>

<text top="311" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What?&#34; he asked, looking around. He saw his father kneeling before him, Wendy </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't stutter!&#34; Jack suddenly screamed into his face. Danny cried out in </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">collapsed into tears. Stricken, Jack pulled him close. &#34;Oh, honey, I'm sorry. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="444" height="17" font="0">I'm sorry, doc. Please. Don't cry. I'm sorry. Everything's okay.&#34; </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  The water ran ceaselessly in the basin, and Wendy felt that she had suddenly </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">stepped into some grinding nightmare where time ran backward, backward to the </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="622" height="17" font="0">time when her drunken husband had broken her son's arm and had then mewled over </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="267" height="17" font="0">him in almost the exact same words. </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">  She ran to them both, pried Danny out of Jack's arms somehow (she saw the look </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">of angry reproach on his face but filed it away for later consideration), and </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">lifted him up. She walked him back into the small bedroom, Danny's arms clasped </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">  She sat down on Danny's bed and rocked him back and forth, soothing him with </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">only worry in his eyes now. He raised questioning eyebrows at her. She shook her </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="92" height="17" font="0">head faintly. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="465" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny,&#34; she said. &#34;Danny, Danny, Danny. 'S okay, doc. 'S fine.&#34; </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="131" height="17" font="0">the old faint pang </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  of jealousy. Jack had shouted at him, she had comforted him, yet it was to his </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="181" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'm sorry if I was bad.&#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nothing to be sorry for, doc.&#34; Jack ruffled his hair. &#34;What the hell happened </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  Danny shook his head slowly, dazedly. &#34;I ... I don't know. Why did you tell </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Of course not,&#34; Jack said heartily, but Wendy felt a cold finger touch her </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="358" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Something about the timer...&#34; Danny muttered. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="495" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What?&#34; Jack was leaning forward, and Danny flinched in her arms. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Jack, you're scaring him!&#34; she said, and her voice was high, accusatory. It </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't know, I don't know,&#34; Danny was saying to his father. &#34;What ... what </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nothing,&#34; Jack muttered. He took his handkerchief from his back pocket and </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">wiped his mouth with it. Wendy had a moment of that sickening time-is-running- </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">backward feeling again. It was a gesture she remembered well from his drinking </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Why did you lock the door, Danny?&#34; she asked gently. &#34;Why did you do that?&#34; </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="265" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Tony,&#34; he said. &#34;Tony told me to.&#34; </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="372" height="17" font="0">  They exchanged a glance over the top of his head. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="336" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Did Tony say why, son?&#34; Jack asked quietly. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I was brushing my teeth and I was thinking about my reading,&#34; Danny said. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">&#34;Thinking real hard. And ... and I saw Tony way down in the mirror. He said he </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="353" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You mean he was behind you?&#34; Wendy asked. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, he was in the mirror.&#34; Danny was very emphatic on this point. &#34;Way down </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">deep. And then I went through the mirror. The next thing I remember Daddy was </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="353" height="17" font="0">shaking me and I thought I was being bad again.&#34; </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="187" height="17" font="0">  Jack winced as if struck. </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="199" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, doc,&#34; he said quietly. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="489" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Tony told you to lock the door?&#34; Wendy asked, brushing his hair. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="57" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes.&#34; </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="290" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And what did he want to show you?&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  Danny tensed in her arms; it was as if the muscles in his body had turned into </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">something like piano wire. &#34;I don't remember,&#34; he said, distraught. &#34;I don't </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="432" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Do you want me to stay a little while? Read you a story?&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No. Just the night light.&#34; He looked shyly at his father. &#34;Would you stay, </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="96" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sure, doc.&#34; </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="353" height="17" font="0">  Wendy sighed. &#34;I'll be in the living room, Jack.&#34; </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  She got up and watched as Danny slid under the covers. He seemed very small. </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="289" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'm okay. Just plug in Snoopy, Mom.&#34; </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  She plugged in the night light, which showed Snoopy lying fast asleep on top </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">of his doghouse. He had never wanted a night light until they moved into the </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">Overlook, and then he had specifically requested one. She turned off the lamp </text>

<text top="974" left="99" width="355" height="17" font="0">face, and Jack's above it. She hesitated a moment </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="281" height="17" font="0">  (and then I went through the mirror) </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="205" height="17" font="0">  and then left them quietly. </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">color of table linen. Her eyes were shiny and flat; her hair hung damply against </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">her neck. &#34;I got all of them,&#34; she said dully, &#34;but one stung me. Jack, you said </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="272" height="17" font="0">they were all dead.&#34; She began to cry. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  He slipped past her without answering and carried the Pyrex bowl over to the </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">nest by Danny's bed. It was still. Nothing there. On the outside, anyway. He </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="285" height="17" font="0">slammed the bowl down over the nest. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="218" height="17" font="0">  &#34;There,&#34; he said. &#34;Come on.&#34; </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="276" height="17" font="0">  They went back into their bedroom. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="281" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Where did it get you?&#34; he asked her. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="160" height="17" font="0">  &#34;My ... on my wrist.&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="90" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Let's see.&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  She showed it to him. Just above the bracelet of lines between wrist and palm, </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="482" height="17" font="0">there was a small circular hole. The flesh around it was puffing up. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Are you allergic to stings?&#34; he asked. &#34;Think hard! If you are, Danny might </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="407" height="17" font="0">be. The fucking little bastards got him five or six times.&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="475" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No,&#34; she said, more calmly. &#34;I ... I just hate them, that's all. Hate </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="52" height="17" font="0">them.&#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  Danny was sitting on the foot of the bed, holding his left hand and looking at </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">them. His eyes, circled with the white of shock, looked at Jack reproachfully. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="471" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Daddy, you said you killed them all. My hand ... it really hurts.&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="503" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Let's see it, doc ... no, I'm not going to touch it. That would make it </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="243" height="17" font="0">hurt even more. Just hold it out.&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="472" height="17" font="0">  He did and Wendy moaned. &#34;Oh Danny ... oh, your poor hand!&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  Later the doctor would count eleven separate stings. Now all they saw was a </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">dotting of small holes, as if his palm and fingers had been sprinkled with </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">grains of red pepper. The swelling was bad. His hand had begun to look like one </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now these. Crunch them up.&#34; She held out five orangeflavored baby aspirin. </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Right,&#34; Jack said grimly. He had found the flash attachment, and he jabbed it </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">lose some of his fright and take an active interest. The hand throbbed dully, </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Not unless he's really in pain,&#34; Jack said. &#34;If a person has a strong allergy </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  He went to the dresser, got the camera and the last flashcube, and gave Danny </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="134" height="17" font="0">Maybe a hundred. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  His heart thudding slowly in his chest, he took his pictures and then set the </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sure. There was a kid in my nursery school back in Vermont — I went to nursery </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">school when I was a little kid — and he had it. He wasn't supposed to use the </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What was that, Dan?&#34; He had turned on the machine. Thin lines began to trace </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It had all these lights, all different colors. And when you turned it on, </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">some colors would flash but not all. And you had to count the colors and if you </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="513" height="17" font="0">pushed the right button, you could turn it off. Brent couldn't use that.&#34; </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="113" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Pretty good.&#34; </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Good. I looked at your EEG and it seems fine. But I'm going to send it to a </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="84" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, Sir.&#34; </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="213" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Tell me about Tony, Dan.&#34; </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  Danny shuffled his feet. &#34;He's just an invisible friend,&#34; he said. &#34;I made him </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="199" height="17" font="0">up. To keep me company.&#34; </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">  Edmonds laughed and put his hands on Danny's shoulders. &#34;Now that's what your </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  Danny thought about it. He looked at Edmonds and then, with a small effort of </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">concentration, he tried to catch Edmonds's thoughts or at least the color of his </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">mood. And suddenly he got an oddly comforting image in his head: file cabinets, </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">their doors sliding shut one after another, locking with a click. Written on the </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">small tabs in the center of each door was: A-C, SECRET; D-G, SECRET; and so on. </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="356" height="17" font="0">  Cautiously he said: &#34;I don't know who Tony is.&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="132" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Is he your age?&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No. He's at least eleven. I think he might be even older. I've never seen him </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="393" height="17" font="0">right up close. He might be old enough to drive a car.&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="284" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You just see him at a distance, huh?&#34; </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="84" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, Sir.&#34; </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="365" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And he always comes just before you pass out?&#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, I don't pass out. It's like I go with him. And he shows me things.&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="178" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What kind of things?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well ...&#34; Danny debated for a moment and then told Edmonds about Daddy's </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="514" height="17" font="0">trunk with all his writing in it, and about how the movers hadn't lost it </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="608" height="17" font="0">between Vermont and Colorado after all. It had been right under the stairs all along. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="409" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And your daddy found it where Tony said he would?&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="410" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Oh yes, sir. Only Tony didn't tell me. He showed me.&#34; </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I understand. Danny, what did Tony show you last night? When you locked </text>

<text top="994" left="99" width="301" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't remember,&#34; Danny said quickly. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="126" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Are you sure?&#34; </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="82" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir.&#34; </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="490" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, sir. Sometimes he shows me things that are going to happen.&#34; </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="77" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Really?&#34; </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="715" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sure. Like one time Tony showed me the amusements and wild animal park in Great Barrington. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">Tony said Daddy was going to take me there for my birthday. He did, too.&#34; </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="239" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What else does he show you?&#34; </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  Danny frowned. &#34;Signs. He's always showing me stupid old signs. And I can't </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="392" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Why do you suppose Tony would do that, Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't know.&#34; Danny brightened. &#34;But my daddy and mommy are teaching me to </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="234" height="17" font="0">  &#34;So you can read Tony's signs.&#34; </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="360" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, I really want to learn. But that too, yeah.&#34; </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="352" height="17" font="0">  Danny looked at the tile floor and said nothing. </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's hard to tell,&#34; Danny said. &#34;I used to. I used to hope he'd come every </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">don't think about DIVORCE anymore.&#34; Dr. Edmonds's gaze sharpened, but Danny </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">didn't notice. He was looking hard at the floor, concentrating on expressing </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">wasps stung me. Only Tony's things sting me up here.&#34; He cocked a finger gravely </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I can't remember!&#34; Danny cried out, agonized. &#34;I'd tell you if I could! It's </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I think it's best if you understand everything, Doctor,&#34; Jack said. &#34;Shortly </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">after Danny was born, I became an alcoholic. I'd had a drinking problem all the </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">worse than ever after Danny was born and the writing I consider to be my real </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">work was going badly. When Danny was three and a half, he spilled some beer on a </text>

<text top="653" left="99" width="479" height="17" font="0">and I ... well ... oh shit.&#34; His voice broke, but his eyes remained dry </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">and unflinching. &#34;It sounds so goddam beastly said out loud. I broke his arm </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">turning him around to spank him. Three months later I gave up drinking. I </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="185" height="17" font="0">haven't touched it since.&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I see,&#34; Edmonds said neutrally. &#34;I knew the arm had been broken, of course. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">It was set well.&#34; He pushed back from his desk a little and crossed his legs. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">&#34;If I may be frank, it's obvious that he's been in no way abused since then. </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="425" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Of course not,&#34; Wendy said hotly. &#34;Jack didn't mean— &#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, Wendy,&#34; Jack said. &#34;I meant to do it. I guess someplace inside I really </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="610" height="17" font="0">did mean to do that to him. Or something even worse.&#34; He looked back at Edmonds </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">again. &#34;You know something, Doctor? This is the first time the word divorce has </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">been mentioned between us. And alcoholism. And child-beating. Three firsts in </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="492" height="17" font="0">fairly confident of my diagnosis. Danny is an intelligent, imaginative, </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="625" height="17" font="0">He mentioned divorce to me, but not the broken arm. When my nurse mentioned the </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You have him, all the same,&#34; Edmonds said dryly. &#34;At any rate, he retires </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="621" height="17" font="0">rooster named Chug-Chug. Of course no one could see Chug-Chug but me. I had two </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">older brothers who often left me behind, and in such a situation Chug-Chug came </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">in mighty handy. And of course you two must understand why Danny's invisible </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="150" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; Wendy said. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="295" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Have you ever pointed it out to him?&#34; </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="224" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No,&#34; Jack said. &#34;Should we?&#34; </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Why bother? Let him realize it in his own time, by his own logic. You see, </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">Danny's fantasies were considerably deeper than those that grow around the </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">ordinary invisible friend syndrome, but he felt he needed Tony that much more. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="612" height="17" font="0">Tony would come and show him pleasant things. Sometimes amazing things. Always </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">good things. Once Tony showed him where Daddy's lost trunk was ... under the </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="636" height="17" font="0">stairs. Another time Tony showed him that Mommy and Daddy were going to take him </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="314" height="17" font="0">to an amusement park for his birthday — &#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">  &#34;At Great Barrington!&#34; Wendy cried. &#34;But how could he know those things? It's </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="355" height="17" font="0">  &#34;He was born with a caul,&#34; Wendy said weakly. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="608" height="17" font="0">  Edmonds's smile became a good, hearty laugh. Jack and Wendy exchanged a glance </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">and then also smiled, both of them amazed at how easy it was. Danny's occasional </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">&#34;lucky guesses&#34; about things was something else they had not discussed much. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Next you'll be telling me he can levitate,&#34; Edmonds said, still smiling. &#34;No, </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">no, no, I'm afraid not. It's not extrasensory but good old human perception, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">which in Danny's case is unusually keen. Mr. Torrance, he knew your trunk was </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">under the stairs because you had looked everywhere else. Process of elimination, </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">what? It's so simple Ellery Queen would laugh at it. Sooner or later you would </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="199" height="17" font="0">have thought of it yourself. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="514" height="17" font="0">  &#34;As for the amusement park at Great Barrington, whose idea was that </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="182" height="17" font="0">originally? Yours or his?&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;His, of course,&#34; Wendy said. &#34;They advertised on all the morning children's </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">programs. He was wild to go. But the thing is, Doctor, we couldn't afford to </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="261" height="17" font="0">take him. And we had told him so.&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Then a men's magazine I'd sold a story to back in 1971 sent a check for fifty </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">dollars,&#34; Jack said. &#34;They were reprinting the story in an annual, or something. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="275" height="17" font="0">So we decided to spend it on Danny.&#34; </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">Danny is doing subconsciously what these so-called mystics and mind readers do </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">quite consciously and cynically. I admire him for it. If life doesn't cause him </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">lost buttons, told her that maybe the TV Guide was under the bed, that he </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">thought he better wear his rubbers to nursery school even though the sun was out </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">... and later that day they had walked home under her umbrella through the </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">pouring rain. Edmonds couldn't know of the curious way Danny had of preguessing </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">them both. She would decide to have an unusual evening cup of tea, go out in the </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">kitchen and find her cup out with a tea bag in it. She would remember that the </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">books were due at the library and find them all neatly piled up on the hall </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">table, her library card on top. Or Jack would take it into his head to wax the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">Volkswagen and find Danny already out there, listening to tinny top-forty music </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="363" height="17" font="0">on his crystal radio as he sat on the curb to watch. </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  Aloud she said, &#34;Then why the nightmares now? Why did Tony tell him to lock </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I believe it's because Tony has outlived his usefulness,&#34; Edmonds said. &#34;He </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="644" height="17" font="0">was born — Tony, not Danny — at a time when you and your husband were straining to </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">keep your marriage together. Your husband was drinking too much. There was the </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="451" height="17" font="0">incident of the broken arm. The ominous quiet between you.&#34; </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  Ominous quiet, yes, that phrase was the real thing, anyway. The stiff, tense </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">meals where the only conversation had been please pass the butter or Danny, eat </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">the rest of your carrots or may I be excused, please. The nights when Jack was </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">gone and she had lain down, dry-eyed, on the couch while Danny watched TV. The </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">mornings when she and Jack had stalked around each other like two angry cats </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="477" height="17" font="0">with a quivering, frightened mouse between them. It all rang true; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="320" height="17" font="0">  (dear God, do old scars ever stop hurting?) </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="174" height="17" font="0">  horribly, horribly true. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  Edmonds resumed, &#34;But things have changed. You know, schizoid behavior is a </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">pretty common thing in children. It's accepted, because all we adults have this </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">unspoken agreement that children are lunatics. They have invisible friends. They </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">may go and sit in the closet when they're depressed, withdrawing from the world. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">They attach talismanic importance to a special blanket, or a teddy bear, or a </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">stuffed tiger. They suck their thumbs. When an adult sees things that aren't </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">there, we consider him ready for the rubber room. When a child says he's seen a </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">indulgently. We have a one-sentence explanation that explains the whole range of </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">was in a pretty good position to develop a full-fledged psychosis. Unhappy home </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I want to thank you,&#34; Jack told him painfully. &#34;I feel better about all this </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  Wendy looked at him, surprised. &#34;Yes, I did. She was killed outside our home </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">in Somersworth, New Hampshire, when she was six and I was ten. She chased a ball </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="353" height="17" font="0">into the street and was struck by a delivery van.&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="200" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Does Danny know that?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="240" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't know. I don't think so.&#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="441" height="17" font="0">  &#34;He says you were thinking about her in the waiting room.&#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I was,&#34; Wendy said slowly. &#34;For the first time in ... oh, I don't know how </text>

<text top="994" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, rum,&#34; Edmonds corrected. &#34;He was quite emphatic about that. Rum. As in </text>

<text top="835" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  Shining the flashlight ahead of him, he stepped past the elevator shaft (at </text>

<text top="875" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">through the small stone arch. His nose wrinkled at the smell of rotting paper. </text>

<text top="311" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">himself might really happen. It might even be right here, buried in these untidy </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">heaps of paper. It could be a work of fiction, or history, or both — a long book </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="424" height="17" font="0">exploding out of this central place in a hundred directions. </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  He stood beneath the cobwebby light, took his handkerchief from his back </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">pocket without thinking, and scrubbed at his lips with it. And that was when he </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="141" height="17" font="0">saw the scrapbook. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  A pile of five boxes stood on his left like some tottering Pisa. The one on </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">keeping its angle of repose for who knew how many years, was a thick scrapbook </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">with white leather covers, its pages bound with two hanks of gold string that </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  Curious, he went over and took it down. The top cover was thick with dust. He </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">held it on a plane at lip level, blew the dust off in a cloud, and opened it. As </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">he did so a card fluttered out and he grabbed it in mid-air before it could fall </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">put Jack in a foul temper all afternoon. The lawyer doubted if the company that </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">commiserated with Jack, but privately she had just been glad that Danny had </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">gotten off as cheaply as he had. It was best to leave lawsuits to people who </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">understood them, and that did not include the Torrances. And they had seen no </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">not finding it, a small boy padding along a dark blue carpet woven with twisting </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">black lines. He had tried a room door from time to time, but of course they were </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">all locked. The passkey was hanging down in the office, he knew where, but Daddy </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="501" height="17" font="0">had told him he shouldn't touch that. And he didn't want to. Did be? </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="163" height="17" font="0">  (Why are you here?) </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  There was nothing aimless about it after all. He had been drawn to Room 217 by </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">a morbid kind of curiosity. He remembered a story Daddy had read to him once </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">when he was drunk. That had been a long time ago, but the story was just as </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="611" height="17" font="0">vivid now as when Daddy had read it to him. Mommy had scolded Daddy and asked </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">what he was doing, reading a three-year-old baby something so horrible. The name </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">of the story was Bluebeard. That was clear in his mind too, because he had </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">thought at first Daddy was saying Bluebird, and there were no bluebirds in the </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">story, or birds of any kind for that matter. Actually the story was about </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">Bluebeard's wife, a pretty lady that had corn-colored hair like Mommy. After </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">Bluebeard married her, they lived in a big and ominous castle that was not </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">unlike the Overlook. And every day Bluebeard went off to work and every day he </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">would tell his pretty little wife not to look in a certain room, although the </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">key to that room was hanging right on a hook, just like the passkey was hanging </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">on the office wall downstairs. Bluebeard's wife had gotten more and more curious </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">about the locked room. She tried to peep through the keyhole the way Danny had </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">tried to look through Room 217's peephole with similar unsatisfying results. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">There was even a picture of her getting down on her knees and trying to look </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">under the door, but the crack wasn't wide enough. The door swung wide and ... </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  The old fairy tale book had depicted her discovery in ghastly, loving detail. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">The image was burned on Danny's mind. The severed heads of Bluebeard's seven </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">previous wives were in the room, each one on its own pedestal, the eyes turned </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">up to whites, the mouths unhinged and gaping in silent screams. They were </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">somehow balanced on necks ragged from the broadsword's decapitating swing, and </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="325" height="17" font="0">there was blood running down the pedestals. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">  Terrified, she had turned to flee from the room and the castle, only to </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">discover Bluebeard standing in the doorway, his terrible eyes blazing. &#34;I told </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">you not to enter this room,&#34; Bluebeard said, unsheathing his sword. &#34;Alas, in </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  He plunged his left hand into his pocket and it came out holding the passkey. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="269" height="17" font="0">It had been there all along, of course. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  He held it by the square metal tab on the end which had OFFICE printed on it </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">in Magic Marker. He twirled the key on its chain, watching it go around and </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">around. After several minutes of this he stopped and slipped the passkey into </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">the lock. It slid in smoothly, with no hitch, as if it had wanted to be there </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="67" height="17" font="0">all along. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="506" height="17" font="0">  (I've thought I've seen things ... nasty things ... promise me you won't </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  And a promise was, of course, very important. Still, his curiosity itched at </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">him as maddeningly as poison ivy in a place you aren't supposed to scratch. But </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">it was a dreadful kind of curiosity, the kind that makes you peek through your </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">fingers during the scariest parts of a scary movie. What was beyond that door </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="148" height="17" font="0">would be no movie. </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">stared at the door a moment longer, blue-gray eyes wide, then turned quickly and </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">walked back down the corridor toward the main hallway that ran at right angles </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="185" height="17" font="0">to the corridor he was in. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">  Something made him pause there and he wasn't sure what for a moment. Then he </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">remembered that directly around this corner, on the way back to the stairs, </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">there was one of those old-fashioned fire extinguishers curled up against the </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="277" height="17" font="0">wall. Curled there like a dozing snake. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  They weren't chemical-type extinguishers at all, Daddy said, although there </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">were several of those in the kitchen. These were the forerunner of the modern </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">sprinkler systems. The long canvas hoses hooked directly into the Overlook's </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">plumbing system, and by turning a single valve you could become a one-man fire </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">department. Daddy said that the chemical extinguishers, which sprayed foam or </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">CO, were much better. The chemicals smothered fires, took away the oxygen they </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">needed to burn, while a high-pressure spray might just spread the flames around. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">Daddy said that Mr. Ullman should replace the old-fashioned hoses right along </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">with the old-fashioned boiler, but Mr. Ullman would probably do neither because </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">he was a CHEAP PRICK. Danny knew that this was one of the worst epithets his </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  The extinguisher was there, a fiat hose folded back a dozen times on itself, </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">the red tank attached to the wall. Above it was an ax in a glass case like a </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">museum exhibit, with white words printed on a red background: IN CASE OF </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="701" height="17" font="0">EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS. Danny could read the word EMERGENCY, which was also the </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">name of one of his favorite TV shows, but was unsure of the rest. But he didn't </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="624" height="17" font="0">like the way the word was used in connection with that long fiat hose. EMERGENCY </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">was', fire, explosions, car crashes, hospitals, sometimes death. And he didn't </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">like the way that hose hung so blandly on the wall. When he was alone, he always </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">skittered past these extinguishers as fast as he could. No particular reason. It </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="267" height="17" font="0">just felt better to go fast. It felt safer. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  Now, heart thumping loudly in his chest, he came around the corner and looked </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">down the hall past the extinguisher to the stairs. Mommy was down there, </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">sleeping. And if Daddy was back from his walk, he would probably be sitting in </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">the kitchen, eating a sandwich and reading a book. He would just walk right past </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="290" height="17" font="0">that old extinguisher and go downstairs. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  He started toward it, moving closer to the far wall until his right arm was </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">brushing the expensive silk paper. Twenty steps away. Fifteen. A dozen. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">  When he was ten steps away, the brass nozzle suddenly rolled off the fat loop </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="123" height="17" font="0">it had been lying </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="91" height="17" font="0">  (sleeping?) </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">  on and fell to the hall carpet with a dull thump. It lay there, the dark bore </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">of its muzzle pointing at Danny. He stopped immediately, his shoulders twitching </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">forward with the suddenness of his scare. His blood thumped thickly in his ears </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">and temples. His mouth had gone dry and sour, his hands curled into fists. Yet </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">the nozzle of the hose only lay there, its brass casing glowing mellowly, a loop </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">of flat canvas leading back up to the red-painted frame bolted to the wall. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">  So it had fallen off, so what? It was only a fire extinguisher, nothing else. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">It was stupid to think that it looked like some poison snake from &#34;Wide World of </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">Animals&#34; that had heard him and woken up. Even if the stitched canvas did look a </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">little bit like scales. He would just step over it and go down the hall to the </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">stairs, walking a little bit fast, maybe, to make sure it didn't snap out after </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="220" height="17" font="0">him and curl around his foot... </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  He wiped his lips with his left hand, in unconscious imitation of his father, </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">and took a step forward. No movement from the hose. Another step. Nothing. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">There, see how stupid you are? You got all worked up thinking about that dumb </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">room and that dumb Bluebeard story and that hose was probably ready to fall off </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="230" height="17" font="0">for the last five years. That's all. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="443" height="17" font="0">  Danny stared at the hose on the floor and thought of wasps. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  Eight steps away, the nozzle of the hose gleamed peacefully at him from the </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">rug as if to say: Don't worry. I'm just a hose, that's all. And even if that </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">to support a full-blown deathwish. So he manufactured ways in which other people </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="628" height="17" font="0">either. The chances of Ullman knowing who the owner was were no more than two in </text>

<text top="653" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">understand. He had been having crying fits, and three nights ago he had gotten </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">crying and couldn't stop it and had broken a lot of things in the Stenger home. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="696" height="17" font="0">It wasn't LOSING YOUR MARBLES, Daddy said, it was HAVING A BREAKDOWN, and Mr. </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="716" height="17" font="0">between LOSING YOUR MARBLES and HAVING A BREAKDOWN, and whether you called it </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="620" height="17" font="0">a BUGHOUSE or a SANNYTARIUM, there were still bars on the windows and they </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="662" height="17" font="0">THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS. They came to get you in a truck with no windows, a </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  That had been over a year ago, after Daddy stopped taking the Bad Stuff but </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">before he had lost his job. Danny still thought about it often. Sometimes when </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">he fell down or bumped his head or had a bellyache, he would begin to cry and </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">the memory would flash over him, accompanied by the fear that he would not be </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">able to stop crying, that he would just go on and on, weeping and wailing, until </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">his daddy went to the phone, dialed it, and said: &#34;Hello? This is Jack Torrance </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="618" height="17" font="0">at 149 Mapleline Way. My son here can't stop crying. Please send THE MEN IN THE </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="639" height="17" font="0">MARBLES. Thank you.&#34; And the gray truck with no windows would come rolling up to </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">his door, they would load him in, still weeping hysterically, and take him away. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">When would he see his mommy and daddy again? NO ONE KNOWS. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">  It was this fear that had kept him silent. A year older, he was quite sure </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">that his daddy and mommy wouldn't let him be taken away for thinking a fire hose </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">was a snake, his rational mind was sure of that, but still, when he thought of </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">telling them, that old memory rose up like a stone filling his mouth and </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">blocking words. It wasn't like Tony; Tony had always seemed perfectly natural </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">(until the bad dreams, of course), and his parents had also seemed to accept </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">Tony as a more or less natural phenomenon. Things like Tony came from being </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">BRIGHT, which they both assumed he was (the same way they assumed they were </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">BRIGHT), but a fire hose that turned into a snake, or seeing blood and brains on </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">the wall of the Presidential Sweet when no one else could, those things would </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">not be natural. They had already taken him to see a regular doctor. Was it not </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">reasonable to assume that THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS might come next? </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  Still he might have told them except he was sure, sooner or later, that they </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">would want to take him away from the hotel. And he wanted desperately to get </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">away from the Overlook. But he also knew that this was his daddy's last chance, </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">that he was here at the Overlook to do more than take care of the place. He was </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="619" height="17" font="0">here to work on his papers. To get over losing his job. To love Mommy/Wendy. And </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">until very recently, it had seemed that all those things were happening. It was </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">only lately that Daddy had begun to have trouble. Since he found those papers. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="346" height="17" font="0">  (This inhuman place makes human monsters.) </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">  What did that mean? He had prayed to God, but God hadn't told him. And what </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">would Daddy do if he stopped working here? He had tried to find out from Daddy's </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">mind, and had become more and more convinced that Daddy didn't know. The </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">strongest proof had come earlier this evening when Uncle Al had called his daddy </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">up on the phone and said mean things and Daddy didn't dare say anything back </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">because Uncle Al could fire him from this job just the way that Mr. Crommert, </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">the Stovington headmaster, and the Board of Directors had fired him from his </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">schoolteaching job. And Daddy was scared to death of that, for him and Mommy as </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="114" height="17" font="0">well as himself. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  So he didn't dare say anything. He could only watch helplessly and hope that </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">there really weren't any Indians at all, or if there were that they would be </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">content to wait for bigger game and let their little three-wagon train pass </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="411" height="17" font="0">  But he couldn't believe it, no matter how hard he tried. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="308" height="17" font="0">  Things were worse at the Overlook now. </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Bad,&#34; Danny said, and then rhyming, singsong, frightening her: &#34;Bad. Sad. </text>

<text top="895" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">blinking into the bright air. In his left hand he was holding a battery-powered </text>
<text top="915" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">hedge-clipper. He tugged a fresh handkerchief out of his back pocket with his </text>
<text top="935" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">right hand, wiped his lips with it, and tucked it away. Snow, they had said on </text>
<text top="955" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">the radio. It was hard to believe, even though he could see the clouds building </text>

<text top="1036" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">do it. The cold nights had surely stunted their growth. The rabbit's ears looked </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  The concrete path ended as abruptly as a diving board. He stepped off it and </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">walked past the drained pool to the gravel path which wound through the hedge </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">sculptures and into the playground itself. He walked over to the rabbit and </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">pushed the button on the handle of the clippers. It hummed into quiet life. </text>

<text top="311" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">occurred to him that he didn't care much for these hedge animals. It had always </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">seemed slightly perverted to him to clip and torture a plain old hedge into </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">something that it wasn't. Along one of the highways in Vermont there had been a </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">hedge billboard on a high slope overlooking the road, advertising some kind of </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="513" height="17" font="0">ice cream. Making nature peddle ice cream, that was just wrong. It was </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="77" height="17" font="0">grotesque. </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  Ah, that was true. So true. He clipped along the rabbit's ears, brushing a </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">small litter of sticks and twigs off onto the grass. The hedge-clipper hummed in </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="506" height="17" font="0">that low and rather disgustingly metallic way that all battery-powered </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">appliances seem to have. The sun was brilliant but it held no warmth, and now it </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="349" height="17" font="0">wasn't so hard to believe that snow was coming. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  Working quickly, knowing that to stop and think when you were at this kind of </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">a task usually meant making a mistake, Jack touched up the rabbit's &#34;face&#34; (up </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">this close it didn't look like a face at all, but he knew that at a distance of </text>

<text top="653" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">  That done, he shut the clippers off, walked down toward the playground, and </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">then turned back abruptly to get it all at once, the entire rabbit. Yes, it </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="354" height="17" font="0">looked all right. Well, he would do the dog next. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But if it was my hotel,&#34; he said, &#34;I'd cut the whole damn bunch of you down.&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">He would, too. Just cut them down and resod the lawn where they'd been and put </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">in half a dozen small metal tables with gaily colored umbrellas. People could </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">have cocktails on the Overlook's lawn in the summer sun. Sloe gin fizzes and </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">margaritas and pink ladies and all those sweet tourist drinks. A rum and tonic, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">maybe. Jack took his handkerchief out of his back pocket and slowly rubbed his </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="86" height="17" font="0">lips with it. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Come on, come on,&#34; he said softly. That was nothing to be thinking about. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">  He was going to start back, and then some impulse made him change his mind and </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="610" height="17" font="0">he went down to the playground instead. It was funny how you never knew kids, he </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">thought. He and Wendy had expected Danny would love the playground; it had </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">everything a kid could want. But Jack didn't think the boy had been down half a </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">dozen times, if that. He supposed if there had been another kid to play with, it </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="197" height="17" font="0">would have been different. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">  The gate squeaked slightly as he let himself in, and then there was crushed </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">gravel crunching under his feet. He went first to the playhouse, the perfect </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">scale model of the Overlook itself. It came up to his lower thigh, just about </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">would have a hotdog lunch and buy peanuts from the man with the cart afterward. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">They would sit on a bench to eat them and dusky clouds of pigeons would flock </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">they would both end up feeding them, and giggling at the way they ran after the </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">nuts, the greedy way they ran after the nuts. Jack didn't think the old man had </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">ever taken his brothers to the park. Jack had been his favorite, and even so </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">Jack had taken his lumps when the old man was drunk, which was a lot of the </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">time. But Jack had loved him for as long as he was able, long after the rest of </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="291" height="17" font="0">the family could only hate and fear him. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">  He pushed off with his hands and went to the bottom, but the trip was </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">unsatisfying. The slide, unused, had too much friction and no really pleasant </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">speed could be built up. And his ass was just too big. His adult feet thumped </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">into the slight dip where thousands of children's feet had landed before him. He </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">stood up, brushed at the seat of his pants, and looked at the hedge-clipper. But </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="489" height="17" font="0">instead of going back to it he went to the swings, which were also a </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">disappointment. The chains had built up rust since the close of the season, and </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">they squealed like things in pain. Jack promised himself he would oil them in </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="79" height="17" font="0">the spring. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  You better stop it, he advised himself. You're not a kid anymore. You don't </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="196" height="17" font="0">need this place to prove it. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="269" height="17" font="0">  But he went on to the cement rings </text>
<text top="874" left="386" width="313" height="17" font="0"> they were too small for him and he passed </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="66" height="17" font="0">them up </text>
<text top="894" left="183" width="535" height="17" font="0"> and then to the security fence which marked the edge of the grounds. He </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">curled his fingers through the links and looked through, the sun crosshatching </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">shadow-lines on his face like a man behind bars. He recognized the similarity </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">himself and he shook the chain link, put a harried expression on his face, and </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">whispered: &#34;Lemme outta here! Lemme outta here!&#34; But for the third time, not </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="358" height="17" font="0">  That was when he heard the sound behind him. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">  He turned around quickly, frowning, embarrassed, wondering if someone had seen </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">him fooling around down here in kiddie country. His eyes ticked off the slides, </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="385" height="17" font="0">up, as if the flesh back there had suddenly tightened? </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  He squinted up at the hotel again, but that was no answer. It simply stood </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">there, its windows dark, a tiny thread of smoke curling from the chimney, coming </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="248" height="17" font="0">from the banked fire in the lobby. </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">  Sure, get going. Because the snow was coming and he had to get the damn hedges </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="483" height="17" font="0">trimmed. It was part of the agreement. Besides, they wouldn't dare </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="370" height="17" font="0">  (Who wouldn't? What wouldn't? Dare do what?) </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  He began to walk back toward the hedge-clipper at the foot of the big kids' </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="511" height="17" font="0">slide, and the sound of his feet crunching on the crushed stone seemed </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">abnormally loud. Now the flesh on his testicles had begun to creep too, and his </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="290" height="17" font="0">buttocks felt hard and heavy, like stone. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="160" height="17" font="0">  (Jesus, what is this?) </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  He stopped by the hedge-clipper, but made no move to pick it up. Yes, there </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">was something different. In the topiary. And it was so simple, so easy to see, </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">that he just wasn't picking it up. Come on, he scolded himself, you just trimmed </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="235" height="17" font="0">the fucking rabbit, so what's the </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  The rabbit was down on all fours, cropping grass. Its belly was against the </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">ground. But not ten minutes ago it had been up on its hind legs, of course it </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="356" height="17" font="0">had been, he had trimmed its ears ... and its belly. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">  His eyes darted to the dog. When he had come down the path it had been sitting </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">up, as if begging for a sweet. Now it was crouched, head tilted, the clipped </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="432" height="17" font="0">wedge of mouth seeming to snarl silently. And the lions —  </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="273" height="17" font="0">  (oh no, baby, oh no, uh-uh, no way) </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  the lions were closer to the path. The two on his right had subtly changed </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">positions, had drawn closer together. The tail of the one on the left now almost </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">jutted out over the path. When he had come past them and through the gate, that </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">lion had been on the right and he was quite sure its tail had been curled around </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="19" height="17" font="0">it. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="470" height="17" font="0">  They were no longer protecting the path; they were blocking it. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  Jack put his hand suddenly over his eyes and then took it away. The picture </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="501" height="17" font="0">didn't change. A soft sigh, too quiet to be a groan, escaped him. In his </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">drinking days he had always been afraid of something like this happening. But </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">when you were a heavy drinker you called it the DTs — good old Ray Milland in </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="404" height="17" font="0">Lost Weekend, seeing the bugs coming out of the walls. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="359" height="17" font="0">  What did you call it when you were cold sober? </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="492" height="17" font="0">  The question was meant to be rhetorical, but his mind answered it </text>

<text top="58" left="99" width="5" height="16" font="0"> </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  Staring at the hedge animals, he realized something had changed while he had </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">his hand over his eyes. The dog had moved closer. No longer crouching, it seemed </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">to be in a running posture, haunches flexed, one front leg forward, the other </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">back. The hedge mouth yawned wider, the pruned sticks looked sharp and vicious. </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">And now he fancied he could see faint eye indentations in the greenery as well. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="117" height="17" font="0">Looking at him. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  Why do they have to be trimmed? he thought hysterically. They're perfect. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  Another soft sound. He involuntarily backed up a step when he looked at the </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">lions. One of the two on the right seemed to have drawn slightly ahead of the </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">other. Its head was lowered. One paw had stolen almost all the way to the low </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="211" height="17" font="0">fence. Dear God, what next? </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  (next it leaps over and gobbles you up like something in an evil nursery </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="46" height="17" font="0">fable) </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  It was like that game they had played when they were kids, red light. One </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">person was &#34;it,&#34; and while he turned his back and counted to ten, the other </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">players crept forward. When &#34;it&#34; got to ten, he whirled around and if he caught </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">anyone moving, they were out of the game. The others remained frozen in statue </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">postures until &#34;it&#34; turned his back and counted again. They got closer and </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">closer, and at last, somewhere between five and ten, you would feel a hand on </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="86" height="17" font="0">your back... </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="205" height="17" font="0">  Gravel rattled on the path. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">  He jerked his head around to look at the dog and it was halfway down the </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">pathway, just behind the lions now, its mouth wide and yawning. Before, it had </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">only been a hedge clipped in the general shape of a dog, something that lost all </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">definition when you got up close to it. But now Jack could see that it had been </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">clipped to look like a German shepherd, and shepherds could be mean. You could </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="165" height="17" font="0">train shepherds to kill. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="168" height="17" font="0">  A low rustling sound. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  The lion on the left had advanced all the way to the fence now; its muzzle was </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">touching the boards. It seemed to be grinning at him. Jack backed up another two </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">steps. His head was thudding crazily and he could feel the dry rasp of his </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">breath in his throat. Now the buffalo had moved, circling to the right, behind </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">and around the rabbit. The head was lowered, the green hedge horns pointing at </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="491" height="17" font="0">him. The thing was, you couldn't watch all of them. Not all at once. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  He began to make a whining sound, unaware in his locked concentration that he </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">was making any sound at all. His eyes darted from one hedge creature to the </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">next, trying to see them move. The wind gusted, making a hungry rattling sound </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">in the close-matted branches. What kind of sound would there be if they got him? </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">But of course he knew. A snapping, rending, breaking sound. It would be </text>
<text top="914" left="644" width="5" height="17" font="0"> </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="471" height="17" font="0">  (no no NO NO I WILL NOT BELIEVE THIS NOT AT ALL!) </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  He clapped his hands over his eyes, clutching at his hair, his forehead, his </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">throbbing temples. And he stood like that for a long time, dread building until </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="490" height="17" font="0">he could stand it no longer and he pulled his hands away with a cry. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  By the putting green the dog was sitting up, as if begging for a scrap. The </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">buffalo was gazing with disinterest back toward the roque court, as it had been </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">when Jack had come down with the clippers. The rabbit stood on its hind legs, </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">ears up to catch the faintest sound, freshly clipped belly exposed. The lions, </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="293" height="17" font="0">rooted into place, stood beside the path. </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="505" height="17" font="0">  He stood frozen for a long time, the harsh breath in his throat finally </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">slowing. He reached for his cigarettes and shook four of them out onto the </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">gravel. He stooped down and picked them up, groped for them, never taking his </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">eyes from the topiary for fear the animals would begin to move again. He picked </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">them up, stuffed three carelessly back into the pack, and lit the fourth. After </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">two deep drags he dropped it and crushed it out. He went to the hedge-clipper </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="126" height="17" font="0">and picked it up. </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  He began to trudge back up to the hotel. Part of his mind tugged fretfully at </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">him, tried to make him detour around the hedge animals, but he went directly up </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">the gravel path, through them. A faint breeze rattled through them, that was </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">all. He had imagined the whole thing. He had had a bad scare but it was over </text>

<text top="955" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">begun to drift against the porch and the sides of the Overlook's driveway. </text>
<text top="975" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">Beyond the grounds the highway had disappeared under an even blanket of white. </text>
<text top="995" left="99" width="625" height="17" font="0">The hedge animals were also gone, but when Wendy and Danny had gotten home, she </text>

<text top="1036" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">and said no more. Now the hedges were buried under amorphous white cloaks. </text>

<text top="794" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">right and left of the path. The truly heroic drifts lay against the Overlook's </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">west side; some of them towered to a height of twenty feet, and beyond them the </text>
<text top="835" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">ground was scoured bare to the grass by the constant windflow. The first-floor </text>
<text top="855" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">windows were covered, and the view from the dining room which Jack had so </text>
<text top="875" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">admired on closing day was now no more exciting than a view of a blank movie </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">with the double track of Danny's Flexible Flyer. The permutations were nearly </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">voice of the wind, so huge and hollowly sincere, made their laughter seem tinny </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">had given Wendy a weird, unreal feeling: they were standing leg-deep in the snow </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">that covered the highway, and it came to her that between now and the spring </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">thaw, the road belonged more to the caribou than it did to them. Now the things </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">that men had made up here were neutralized. The caribou understood that, she </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">believed. She had put the binoculars down and had said something about starting </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">lunch and in the kitchen she had cried a little, trying to rid herself of the </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">awful pent-up feeling that sometimes fell on her like a large, pressing hand </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">over her heart. She thought of the caribou. She thought of the wasps Jack had </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">put out on the service entrance platform, under the Pyrex bowl, to freeze. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">  There were plenty of snowshoes hung from nails in the equipment shed, and Jack </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="505" height="17" font="0">found a pair to fit each of them, although Danny's pair was quite a bit </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">outsized. Jack did well with them. Although he had not snowshoed since his </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">boyhood in Berlin, New Hampshire, he retaught himself quickly. Wendy didn't care </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">much for it — even fifteen minutes of tramping around on the outsized laced </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="373" height="17" font="0">paddles made her legs and ankles ache outrageously </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">working hard to pick up the knack. He still fell often, but Jack was pleased </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">with his progress. He said that by February Danny would be skipping circles </text>

<text top="829" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">His breath blew into her face and there was no smell of liquor on it. Of course </text>
<text top="849" left="99" width="240" height="17" font="0">not; there was no liquor up here. </text>
<text top="870" left="99" width="491" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What's wrong?&#34; She held him as best she could. &#34;Jack, what is it?&#34; </text>
<text top="890" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  But he could do nothing at first but sob, clinging to her, almost crushing the </text>

<text top="930" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">warding-off gesture. His sobs were heavy and fierce. He was shuddering all over, </text>

<text top="1010" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">incoherent at first, but coming clearer as his tears began to spend themselves. </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="175" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny!&#34; she shrieked. </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  He had denied doing it. He had been horrified at the bruises, at Danny's soft </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">had been responsible. The fact that he had done it when he was asleep was </text>
<text top="492" left="659" width="35" height="17" font="0"> in a </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="153" height="17" font="0">terrible, twisted way </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  Actually it was not much of a decision. There was nothing she could do alone, </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">not even carry Danny down to the office and call for help on the CB radio. He </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">had suffered a great shock. He ought to be taken out quickly before any </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">permanent damage could be done. She refused to let herself believe that </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  And still she agonized over it, looking for another alternative. She did not </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">when she had shelved the idea of divorce. Now she was nearly paralyzed by the </text>

<text top="974" left="99" width="248" height="17" font="0">of every day of the rest of her life. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  There was not a gun in the place. There were knives hanging from the </text>

<text top="1035" left="99" width="502" height="17" font="0">  In her striving to make the right decision, to find the alternative, the </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  Well, sooner or later she'd have to come out, unless she planned a radical </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">sort of diet for the two of them. A rather ugly grin touched his lips at the </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  He went downstairs to the ground floor, stood aimlessly by the lobby desk for </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">beneath their clear plastic covers, glimmered up at him. All was deserted now </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">hung the whole length of the circular drive, the golden-yellow light spilling </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">from these high windows that were now drifted over with snow. Men </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="505" height="17" font="0">and women in costume, here a glittering princess, there a high-booted </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="340" height="17" font="0">cavalier, flashing jewelry and flashing wit every </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  He found himself standing on the other side of the dining room, just outside </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">the stylized batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge where, on that night in 1945, </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="260" height="17" font="0">all the booze would have been free. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="423" height="17" font="0">  (Belly up to the bar, pardner, the drinks're on the house.) </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">  He stepped through the batwings and into the deep, folded shadows of the bar. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">And a strange thing occurred. He had been in here before, once to check the </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">inventory sheet Ullman had left, and he knew the place had been stripped clean. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">The shelves were totally bare. But now, lit only murkily by the light which </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">filtered through from the dining room (which was itself only dimly lit because </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">of the snow blocking the windows), he thought he saw ranks and ranks of bottles </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">twinkling mutedly behind the bar, and syphons, and even beer dripping from the </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">spigots of all three highly polished taps. Yes, he could even smell beer, that </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">damp and fermented and yeasty odor, no different from the smell that had hung </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">finely misted around his father's face every night when he came home from work. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  Eyes widening, he fumbled for the wall switch, and the low, intimate bar- </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">lighting came on, circles of twenty-watt bulbs emplanted on the tops of the </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">left and right, the velvet-upholstered booths stood like men with high backs, </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">each one designed to give a maximum of privacy to the couple inside. Straight </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="498" height="17" font="0">ahead, across the red-carpeted floor, forty barstools stood around the </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  He approached it, giving his head a little shake of bewilderment as he did so. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">It was like that day on the playground when ... but there was no sense in </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">thinking about that. Still he could have sworn he had seen those bottles, </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">vaguely, it was true, the way you see the darkened shapes of furniture in a room </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">where the curtains have been drawn. Mild glints on glass. The only thing that </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">remained was that smell of beer, and Jack knew that was a smell that faded into </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">the woodwork of every bar in the world after a certain period of time, not to be </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">eradicated by any cleaner invented. Yet the smell here seemed sharp ... almost </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="43" height="17" font="0">fresh. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  He sat down on one of the stools and propped his elbows on the bar's leather- </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="405" height="17" font="0">cushioned edge. At his left hand was a bowl for peanuts </text>
<text top="452" left="522" width="170" height="17" font="0"> now empty, of course. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">The first bar he'd been in for nineteen months and the damned thing was dry </text>
<text top="472" left="675" width="35" height="17" font="0"> just </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">his luck. All the same, a bitterly powerful wave of nostalgia swept over him, </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">and the physical craving for a drink seemed to work itself up from his belly to </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">his throat to his mouth and nose, shriveling and wrinkling the tissues as it </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="471" height="17" font="0">went, making them cry out for something wet and long and cold. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  He glanced at the shelves again in wild, irrational hope but the shelves were </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="490" height="17" font="0">just as empty as before. He grinned in pain and frustration. His fists, </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">clenching slowly, made minute scratchings on the bar's leather-padded edge. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="377" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Hi, Lloyd,&#34; he said. &#34;A little slow tonight, isn't it?&#34; </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="392" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd said it was. Lloyd asked him what it would be. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now I'm really glad you asked me that,&#34; Jack said, &#34;really glad. Because I </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">happen to have two twenties and two tens in my wallet and I was afraid they'd be </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">sitting there until sometime next April. There isn't a Seven-Eleven around here, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="605" height="17" font="0">would you believe it? And I thought they had Seven-Elevens on the fucking moon.&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="154" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd sympathized. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  &#34;So here's what,&#34; Jack said. &#34;You set me up an even twenty martinis. An even </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">twenty, just like that, kazang. One for every month I've been on the wagon and </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="478" height="17" font="0">one to grow on. You can do that, can't you? You aren't too busy?&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="239" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd said he wasn't busy at all. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Good man. You line those martians up right along the bar and I'm going to </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="488" height="17" font="0">take them down, one by one. White man's burden, Lloyd my man.&#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd turned to do the job. Jack reached into his pocket for his money clip </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">and came out with an Excedrin bottle instead. His money clip was on the bedroom </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">bureau, and of course his skinny-shanks wife had locked him out of the bedroom. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="292" height="17" font="0">Nice going, Wendy. You bleeding bitch. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I seem to be momentarily light,&#34; Jack said. &#34;How's my credit in this joint, </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="74" height="17" font="0">anyhow?&#34; </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="224" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd said his credit was fine. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  &#34;That's super. I like you, Lloyd. You were always the best of them. Best </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  The booths were all empty, stretching away from the lounge door to the left </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">and right, the line on his left cornering to flank the bar's horseshoe curve </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">down the short length of the room. Padded leather seats and backs. Gleaming dark </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  He turned back, swallowing the rest of the dissolving Excedrin with a grimace. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="507" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Lloyd, you're a wonder,&#34; he said. &#34;Set up already. Your speed is only </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  Jack contemplated the twenty imaginary drinks, the martini glasses blushing </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">droplets of condensation, each with a swizzle poked through a plump green olive. </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="268" height="17" font="0">He could almost smell gin on the air. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">  &#34;The wagon,&#34; he said. &#34;Have you ever been acquainted with a gentleman who has </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="468" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd allowed as how he had met such men from time to time. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="618" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Have you ever renewed acquaintances with such a man after he hopped back off?&#34;  </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="282" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd could not, in all honesty, recall. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You never did, then,&#34; Jack said. He curled his hand around the first drink, </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">carried his fist to his mouth, which was open, and turned his fist up. He </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">swallowed and then tossed the imaginary glass over his shoulder. The people were </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">back again, fresh from their costume ball, studying him, laughing behind their </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">hands. He could feel them. If the backbar had featured a mirror instead of those </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">damn stupid empty shelves, he could have seen them. Let them stare. Fuck them. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="287" height="17" font="0">Let anybody stare who wanted to stare. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No, you never did,&#34; he told Lloyd. &#34;Few men ever return from the fabled </text>

<text top="1035" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">shoulder. He could almost hear them smashing on the floor. And goddam if he </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  He stopped. Lloyd was gone. Worse still, he had never been there. The drinks </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">had never been there. Only the people in the booths, the people from the costume </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">party, and he could almost hear their muffled laughter as they held their hands </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">to their mouths and pointed, their eyes sparkling with cruel pinpoints of light. </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">autumn leaves. Jack stared at the empty lounge for a tick of time, his eyes wide </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">and dark. A pulse beat noticeably in the center of his forehead. In the very </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">center of him a cold certainty was forming and the certainty was that he was </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">losing his mind. He felt an urge to pick up the bar stool next to him, reverse </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">it, and go through the place like an avenging whirlwind. Instead he whirled back </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="283" height="17" font="0">around to the bar and began to bellow: </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  He was so startled he almost fell off the stool whirling it around. Wendy was </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">strongly; it was just before the curtain of Act II in some oldtime temperance </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">play, one so poorly mounted that the prop man had forgotten to stock the shelves </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  &#34;This matters!&#34; he shouted. He brought one fist crashing down on the bar, hard </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  Danny began to stir in her arms. The slack, empty expression on his face had </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">begun to break up like a thick matte of ice over some buried surface. His lips </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">twisted, as if at some weird taste. His eyes widened. His hands came up as if to </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="261" height="17" font="0">cover them and then dropped back. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  Abruptly he stiffened in her arms. His back arched into a bow, making Wendy </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">stagger. And he suddenly began to shriek, mad sounds that escaped his straining </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">throat in bolt after crazy, echoing bolt. The sound seemed to fill the empty </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="606" height="17" font="0">downstairs and come back at them like banshees. There might have been a hundred </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="219" height="17" font="0">Dannys, all screaming at once. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="488" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Jack!&#34; she cried in terror. &#34;Oh God Jack what's wrong with him?&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  He came off the stool, numb from the waist down, more frightened than he had </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">ever been in his life. What hole had his son poked through and into? What dark </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="345" height="17" font="0">nest? And what had been in there to sting him? </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="224" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny!&#34; he roared. &#34;Danny!&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  Danny saw him. He broke his mother's grip with a sudden, fierce strength that </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">gave her no chance to hold him. She stumbled back against one of the booths and </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="127" height="17" font="0">nearly fell into it. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Daddy!&#34; he screamed, running to Jack, his eyes huge and affrighted. &#34;Oh Daddy </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="369" height="17" font="0">Daddy, it was her! Her! Her! Oh Daaaaahdeee — &#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  He slammed into Jack's arms like a blunt arrow, making Jack rock on his feet. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">Danny clutched at him furiously, at first seeming to pummel him like a fighter, </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">then clutching his belt and sobbing against his shirt. Jack could feel his son's </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="284" height="17" font="0">face, hot and working, against his belly. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="143" height="17" font="0">  Daddy, it was her. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">  Jack looked slowly up into Wendy's face. His eyes were like small silver </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Wendy?&#34; Voice soft, nearly purring. &#34;Wendy, what did you do to him?&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  Wendy stared back at him in stunned disbelief, her face pallid. She shook her </text>

<text top="373" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Jack, I don't know what he's talking about. Please, you must believe that.&#34; </text>
<text top="393" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I do believe it,&#34; he said, although he had to admit to himself that it gave </text>
<text top="413" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">him a certain amount of pleasure to see the shoe switched to the other foot with </text>
<text top="433" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">such dazzling, unexpected speed. But his anger at Wendy had been only a passing </text>
<text top="453" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">gut twitch. In his heart he knew Wendy would pour a can of gasoline over herself </text>
<text top="473" left="99" width="306" height="17" font="0">and strike a match before harming Danny. </text>
<text top="493" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  The large tea kettle was on the back burner, poking along on low heat. Jack </text>
<text top="513" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">dropped a teabag into his own large ceramic cup and poured hot water halfway. </text>
<text top="533" left="99" width="375" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Got cooking sherry, don't you?&#34; he asked Wendy. </text>
<text top="553" left="99" width="346" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What? ... oh, sure. Two or three bottles of it.&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="155" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Which cupboard?&#34; </text>
<text top="594" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  She pointed, and Jack took one of the bottles down. He poured a hefty dollop </text>
<text top="614" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">into the teacup, put the sherry back, and filled the last quarter of the cup </text>
<text top="634" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">with milk. Then he added three tablespoons of sugar and stirred. He brought it </text>
<text top="654" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">to Danny, whose sobs had tapered off to snifflings and hitchings. But he was </text>
<text top="674" left="99" width="386" height="17" font="0">trembling all over, and his eyes were wide and starey. </text>
<text top="694" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Want you to drink this, doc,&#34; Jack said. &#34;It's going to taste frigging awful, </text>
<text top="714" left="99" width="461" height="17" font="0">but it'll make you feel better. Can you drink it for your daddy?&#34; </text>
<text top="734" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  Danny nodded that he could and took the cup. He drank a little, grimaced, and </text>
<text top="754" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">looked questioningly at Jack. Jack nodded and Danny drank again. Wendy felt the </text>
<text top="774" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">familiar twist of jealousy somewhere in her middle, knowing the boy would not </text>
<text top="794" left="99" width="158" height="17" font="0">have drunk it for her. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  On the heels of that came an uncomfortable, even startling thought: Had she </text>
<text top="835" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">wanted to think Jack was to blame? Was she that jealous? It was the way her </text>
<text top="855" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">mother would have thought, that was the really horrible thing. She could </text>
<text top="875" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">remember a Sunday when her Dad had taken her to the park and she had toppled </text>
<text top="895" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">from the second tier of the jungle gym, cutting both knees. When her father </text>
<text top="915" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">brought her home, her mother had shrieked at him: What did you do? Why weren't </text>
<text top="935" left="99" width="361" height="17" font="0">you watching her? What kind of a father are you? </text>
<text top="955" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  (She had hounded him to his grave; by the time he divorced her it was too </text>
<text top="975" left="99" width="40" height="17" font="0">late.) </text>
<text top="995" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  She had never even given Jack the benefit of the doubt. Not the smallest. </text>
<text top="1015" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">Wendy felt her face burn yet knew with a kind of helpless finality that if the </text>
<text top="1036" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">whole thing were to be played over again, she would do and think the same way. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="463" height="17" font="0">She carried part of her mother with her always, for good or bad. </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  It took Danny fifteen minutes to drink half of the big cup's contents, and by </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="452" height="17" font="0">that time he had calmed visibly. The shakes were almost gone. </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  Jack put his hands solemnly on his son's shoulders. &#34;Danny, do you think you </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">driving fresh snow down from the northwest; the creaking and groaning of the old </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">Wendy with unexpected force as it sometimes did, like a blow under the heart. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I want ... to tell you everything,&#34; Danny said. &#34;I wish I had before.&#34; He </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="449" height="17" font="0">picked up the cup and held it, as if comforted by the warmth. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Why didn't you, son?&#34; Jack brushed Danny's sweaty, tumbled hair back gently </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="111" height="17" font="0">from his brow. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Because Uncle Al got you the job. And I couldn't figure out how it was good </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">for you here and bad for you here at the same time. It was ...&#34; He looked at </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="373" height="17" font="0">them for help. He did not have the necessary word. </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  &#34;A dilemma?&#34; Wendy asked gently. &#34;When neither choice seems any good?&#34; </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="247" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, that.&#34; He nodded, relieved. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  Wendy said: &#34;The day that you trimmed the hedges, Danny and I had a talk in </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="415" height="17" font="0">the truck. The day the first real snow came. Remember?&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Jack nodded. The day he had trimmed the hedges was very clear in his mind. </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">vibratoriously up the shaft, the brass grate rattling madly. Wendy had a true </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">claustrophobe's horror of the elevator, he knew. She envisioned the three of </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">could see them growing thinner and weaker, starving to death. Or perhaps dining </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">on each other, the way those Rugby players had. He remembered a bumper sticker </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="654" height="17" font="0">he had seen in Boulder, RUGBY PLAYERS EAT THEIR OWN DEAD. He could think of </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="650" height="17" font="0">others. YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT. Or menu items. Welcome to the Overlook Dining </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">flicked over his features again. As the number 2 rose on the shaft wall, he </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">threw the brass handle back to the home position and the elevator car creaked to </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">a stop. He took his Excedrin from his pocket, shook three of them into his hand, </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">and opened the elevator door. Nothing in the Overlook frightened him. He felt </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="218" height="17" font="0">that he and it were simpatico. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">  He walked up the hall flipping his Excedrin into his mouth and chewing them </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">one by one. He rounded the corner into the short corridor off the main hall. The </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">door to Room 217 was ajar, and the passkey hung from the lock on its white </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="56" height="17" font="0">paddle. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  He frowned, feeling a wave of irritation and even real anger. Whatever had </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">come of it, the boy had been trespassing. He had been told, and told bluntly, </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">that certain areas of the hotel were off limits: the equipment shed, the </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">basement, and all of the guest rooms. He would talk to Danny about that just as </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">soon as the boy was over his fright. He would talk to him reasonably but </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">sternly. There were plenty of fathers who would have done more than just talk. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">They would have administered a good shaking, and perhaps that was what Danny </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">needed. If the boy had gotten a scare, wasn't that at least his just deserts? </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  He walked down to the door, removed the passkey, dropped it into his pocket, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">and stepped inside. The overhead light was on. He glanced at the bed, saw it was </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">not rumpled, and then walked directly across to the bathroom door. A curious </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">certainty had grown in him. Although Watson had mentioned no names or room </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">numbers, Jack felt sure that this was the room the lawyer's wife and her stud </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">had shared, that this was the bathroom where she had been found dead, full of </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="301" height="17" font="0">barbiturates and Colorado Lounge booze. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="608" height="17" font="0">  He pushed the mirror-backed bathroom door open and stepped through. The light </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">in here was off. He turned it on and observed the long, Pullman-car room, </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">furnished in the distinctive early nineteen-hundreds-remodeled-in-the-twenties </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">style that seemed common to all Overlook bathrooms, except for the ones on the </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">third floor — those were properly Byzantine, as befitted the royalty, politicians, </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="431" height="17" font="0">movie stars, and capos who had stayed there over the years. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  The shower curtain, a pallid pastel pink, was drawn protectively around the </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="158" height="17" font="0">long claw-footed tub. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="223" height="17" font="0">  (nevertheless they did move) </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  And for the first time he felt his new sense of sureness (almost cockiness) </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">that had come over him when Danny ran to him shouting It was her! It was her! </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">deserting him. A chilled finger pressed gently against the base of his spine, </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">cooling him off ten degrees. It was joined by others and they suddenly rippled </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">all the way up his back to his medulla oblongata, playing his spine like a </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">  His anger at Danny evaporated, and as he stepped forward and pushed the shower </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">  Relief and irritation vented in a sudden &#34;Pah!&#34; sound that escaped his </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">compressed lips like a very small explosive. The tub had been scrubbed clean at </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">the end of the season; except for the rust stain under the twin faucets, it </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">sparkled. There was a faint but definable smell of cleanser, the kind that can </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">irritate your nose with the smell of its own righteousness for weeks, even </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="223" height="17" font="0">months, after it has been used. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  He bent down and ran his fingertips along the bottom of the tub. Dry as a </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">bone. Not even a hint of moisture. The boy had been either hallucinating or </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">outright lying. He felt angry again. That was when the bathmat on the floor </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">caught his attention. He frowned down at it. What was a bathmat doing in here? </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">It should be down in the linen cupboard at the end of the wing with the rest of </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">the sheets and towels and pillow slips. All the linen was supposed to be there. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">Not even the beds were really made up in these guest rooms; the mattresses had </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">been zipped into clear plastic and then covered with bedspreads. He supposed </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">Danny might have gone down and gotten it — the passkey would open the linen </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">cupboard — but why? He brushed the tips of his fingers back and forth across it. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="202" height="17" font="0">The bathmat was bone dry. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  He went back to the bathroom door and stood in it. Everything was all right. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">The boy had been dreaming. There was not a thing out of place. It was a little </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">puzzling about the bathmat, granted, but the logical explanation was that some </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">chambermaid, hurrying like mad on the last day of the season, had just forgotten </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="358" height="17" font="0">to pick it up. Other than that, everything was —  </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="470" height="17" font="0">  His nostrils flared a little. Disinfectant, that self-righteous smell, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="200" height="17" font="0">cleaner-than-thou. And —  </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="55" height="17" font="0">  Soap? </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">  Surely not. But once the smell had been identified, it was too clear to </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">dismiss. Soap. And not one of those postcard-size bars of Ivory they provide you </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">with in hotels and motels, either. This scent was light and perfumed, a lady's </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">soap. It had a pink sort of smell. Camay or Lowila, the brand that Wendy had </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="193" height="17" font="0">always used in Stovington. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="265" height="17" font="0">  (It's nothing. It's your imagination.) </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">  He crossed jerkily to the door which gave on the hall, feeling the irregular </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">thump of a headache beginning at his temples. Too much had happened today, too </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">much by far. He wouldn't spank the boy or shake him, just talk to him, but by </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">God, he wasn't going to add Room 217 to his problems. Not on the basis of a dry </text>

<text top="1035" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">  There was a sudden rattling, metallic sound behind him. It came just as his </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="501" height="17" font="0">  Then he had control of himself, a little, anyway, and he let go of the </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">doorknob and turned carefully around. His joints creaked. He began to walk back </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="310" height="17" font="0">to the bathroom door, step by leaden step. </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  The shower curtain, which he had pushed back to look into the tub, was now </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">crypt, had been the curtain rings on the overhead bar. Jack stared at the </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">curtain. His face felt as if it had been heavily waxed, all dead skin on the </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">outside, live, hot rivulets of fear on the inside. The way he had felt on the </text>

<text top="332" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">  There was something behind the pink plastic shower curtain. There was </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="497" height="17" font="0">  He could see it, ill defined and obscure through the plastic, a nearly </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">of the shower attachment. A woman long dead and reclining in her bath, a bar of </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">Lowila in one stiffening hand as she waited patiently for whatever lover might </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  Jack told himself to step forward boldly and rake the shower curtain back. To </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">expose whatever might be there. Instead he turned with jerky, marionette </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">strides, his heart whamming frightfully in his chest, and went back into the </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="131" height="17" font="0">bed/sitting room. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="230" height="17" font="0">  The door to the hall was shut. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  He stared at it for a long, immobile second. He could taste his terror now. It </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  He walked to the door with that same jerky stride and forced his fingers to </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">odd wet thumping sound, far off, dim, as if something had just scrambled </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="497" height="17" font="0">belatedly out of the tub, as if to greet a caller, as if it had realized the </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="263" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You say that as if it were so easy.&#34; </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But he did,&#34; Jack said, a trifle shortly. He had been frightened at Danny's </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">blank-eyed, slack-faced state too, of course he had. At first. But the more he </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">thought about it, the more he wondered if it hadn't been a piece of play-acting </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="489" height="17" font="0">put on to escape his punishment. He had, after all, been trespassing. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All the same,&#34; she said. She came to him and sat on the end of the bed by his </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">desk. Her face was both surprised and worried. &#34;Jack, the bruises on his neck! </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="392" height="17" font="0">Something got at him! And I want him away from it!&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't shout,&#34; he said. &#34;My head aches, Wendy. I'm as worried about this as </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="255" height="17" font="0">you are, so please ... don't ... shout.&#34; </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="487" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All right,&#34; she said, lowering her voice. &#34;I won't shout. But I don't </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">understand you, Jack. Someone is in here with us. And not a very nice someone, </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">either. We have to get down to Sidewinder, not just Danny but all of us. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="427" height="17" font="0">Quickly. And you ... you're sitting there reading your play!&#34; </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't,&#34; she said, and put a hand on his shoulder. He leaned his head against </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; Wendy said, and then she rushed on: &#34;But it's not just you. I worry </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">when he goes out to play. I worry about him wanting a two-wheeler next year, </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">even one with training wheels. I worry about his teeth and his eyesight and </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">about this thing, what he calls his shine. I worry. Because he's little and he </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">want him. And it will go through us to get him if it has to. That's why we must </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="476" height="17" font="0">get him out, Jack. I know that! I feel that! We must get him out!&#34; </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  Her hand had tightened painfully on his shoulder in her agitation, but he </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">didn't move away. One hand found the firm weight of her left breast and he began </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="213" height="17" font="0">to stroke it through her shirt. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Wendy,&#34; he said, and stopped. She waited for him to rearrange whatever he had </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">to say. His strong hand on her breast felt good, soothing. &#34;I could maybe </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">snowshoe him down. He could walk part of the way himself, but I would mostly </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">have to carry him. It would mean camping out one, two, maybe three nights. That </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">would mean building a travois to carry supplies and bedrolls on. We have the </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">AM/FM radio, so we could pick a day when the weather forecast called for a </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">three-day spell of good weather. But if the forecast was wrong,&#34; he finished, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="374" height="17" font="0">his voice soft and measured, &#34;I think we might die.&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  Her face had paled. It looked shiny, almost ghostly. He continued to stroke </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="461" height="17" font="0">her breast, rubbing the ball of his thumb gently over the nipple. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  She made a soft sound — from his words or in reaction to his gentle pressure on </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">her breast, he couldn't tell. He raised his hand slightly and undid the top </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">button of her shirt. Wendy shifted her legs slightly. All at once her jeans </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="432" height="17" font="0">seemed too tight, slightly irritating in a pleasant sort of way. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It would mean leaving you alone because you can't snowshoe worth beans. It </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="629" height="17" font="0">would be maybe three days of not knowing. Would you want that?&#34; His hand dropped </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">to the second button, slipped it, and the beginning of her cleavage was exposed. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No,&#34; she said in a voice that was slightly thick. She glanced over at Danny. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">He had stopped twisting and turning. His thumb had crept back into his mouth. So </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">that was all right. But Jack was leaving something out of the picture. It was </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="327" height="17" font="0">too bleak. There was something else ... what? </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">  &#34;If we stay put,&#34; Jack said, unbuttoning the third and fourth buttons with </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">that same deliberate slowness, &#34;a ranger from the park or a game warden is going </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">hard and erect. He slipped his tongue slowly back and forth across it in a way </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="460" height="17" font="0">he knew she liked. Wendy moaned a little and arched her back. </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  He raised his head slightly to answer and then settled his mouth against the </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  His mouth froze against her breast for a moment, and then he sat up. Her own </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">face was slightly flushed, her eyes overbright. Jack's on the other hand, was </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">calm, as if he had been reading a rather dull book instead of engaging in </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="166" height="17" font="0">foreplay with his wife. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  &#34;If there's a snowmobile there's no problem,&#34; she said excitedly. &#34;We can all </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="389" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Wendy, I've never driven a snowmobile in my life.&#34; </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It can't be that hard to learn. Back in Vermont you see ten-year-olds driving </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">know. And you had a motorcycle when we met.&#34; He had, a Honda 350cc. He had </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">traded it in on a Saab shortly after he and Wendy took up residence together. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="503" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I suppose I could,&#34; he said slowly. &#34;But I wonder how well it's been </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">maintained. Ullman and Watson ... they run this place from May to October. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">They have summertime minds. I know it won't have gas in it. There may not be </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  She was totally excited now, leaning over him, her breasts tumbling out of her </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="291" height="17" font="0">Maybe that would teach her to shut up. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  &#34;The gas is no problem,&#34; she said. &#34;The VW and the hotel truck are both full. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">There's gas for the emergency generator downstairs, too. And there must be a </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; he said. &#34;There is.&#34; Actually there were three of them, two five-gallons </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll bet the sparkplugs and the battery are out there too. Nobody would store </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">their snowmobile in one place and the plugs and battery someplace else, would </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">sleeping. A spill of hair had fallen across his forehead and Jack brushed it </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="221" height="17" font="0">away gently. Danny didn't stir. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And if you can get it running you'll take us out?&#34; she asked from behind him. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="341" height="17" font="0">&#34;On the first day the radio says good weather?&#34; </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">  For a moment he didn't answer. He stood looking down at his son, and his mixed </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">feelings dissolved in a wave of love. He was the way she had said, vulnerable, </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="485" height="17" font="0">pink. George's eyes were closed. His penis floated limply, like kelp. </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">himself up to a sitting position. The knife stuck straight out from his chest, </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="446" height="17" font="0">equidistantly placed between nipples. The wound was lipless. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="412" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You set the timer ahead,&#34; silver-eyed George told him. </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  George was standing now, still fixing him with that inhuman silver glare, but </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">his mouth had drawn back in a dead and grimacing smile. He threw one leg over </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">the porcelained side of the tub. One white and wrinkled foot placed itself on </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="96" height="17" font="0">the bathmat. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  &#34;First you tried to run me over on my bike and then you set the timer ahead </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It was for your own good,&#34; Jack said, backing up. &#34;I set it ahead for your </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You did! You did cheat!&#34; he screamed in fear and anger as he crossed the </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  George's hands were on his neck again. Jack's heart swelled with fear until he </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">was sure it would burst. And then, at last, his hand curled around the doorknob </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">and it turned under his hand and he yanked the door open. He plunged out, not </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">into the second-floor hallway, but into the basement room beyond the arch. The </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">cobwebby light was on. His campchair, stark and geometrical, stood beneath it. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">And all around it was a miniature mountain range of boxes and crates and banded </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">bundles of records and invoices and God knew what. Relief surged through him. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll find it!&#34; he heard himself screaming. He seized a damp and moldering </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">cardboard box; it split apart in his hands, spilling out a waterfall of yellow </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">flimsies. &#34;It's here somewhere! I will find it!&#34; He plunged his hands deep into </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">the pile of papers and came up with a dry, papery wasps' nest in one hand and a </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">electrical cord and attached to the other end of the cord was a bundle of </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="342" height="17" font="0">dynamite. &#34;Here!&#34; he screamed. &#34;Here, take it!&#34; </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  His relief became absolute triumph. He had done more than escape George; he </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">had conquered. With these talismanic objects in his hands, George would never </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="329" height="17" font="0">touch him again. George would flee in terror. </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">  He began to turn so he could confront George, and that was when George's hands </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">settled around his neck, squeezing, stopping his breath, damming up his </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="347" height="17" font="0">respiration entirely after one final dragging gasp. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="396" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't stutter,&#34; whispered George from behind him. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">  He dropped the wasps' nest and wasps boiled out of it in a furious brown and </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">yellow wave. His lungs were on fire. His wavering sight fell on the timer and </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">the sense of triumph returned, along with a cresting wave of righteous wrath. </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">Instead of connecting the timer to dynamite, the cord ran to the gold knob of a </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">stout black cane, like the one his father had carried after the accident with </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="112" height="17" font="0">the milk truck. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  He grasped it and the cord parted. The cane felt heavy and right in his hands. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">He swung it back over his shoulder. On the way up it glanced against the wire </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">from which the light bulb depended and the light began to swing back and forth, </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">making the room's hooded shadows rock monstrously against the floor and walls. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="626" height="17" font="0">On the way down the cane struck something much harder. George screamed. The grip </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="182" height="17" font="0">on Jack's throatloosened. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  He tore free of George's grip and whirled. George was on his knees, his head </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">drooping, his hands laced together on top of it. Blood welled through his </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="55" height="17" font="0">fingers. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="516" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Please,&#34; George whispered humbly. &#34;Give me a break, Mr. Torrance,&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now you'll take your medicine,&#34; Jack grunted. &#34;Now by God, won't you. Young </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">  As the light swayed above him and the shadows danced and flapped, he began to </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">swing the cane, bringing it down again and again, his arm rising and falling </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">like a machine. George's bloody protecting fingers fell away from his head and </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">Jack brought the cane down again and again, and on his neck and shoulders and </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">back and arms. Except that the cane was no longer precisely a cane; it seemed to </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">be a mallet with some kind of brightly striped handle. A mallet with a hard side </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">and soft side. The business end was clotted with blood and hair. And the flat, </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">whacking sound of the mallet against flesh had been replaced with a hollow </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">booming sound, echoing and reverberating. His own voice had taken on this same </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">of his eye, sad and. wise. He turned back, his heart in his throat. Everything </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">to the first pines about a mile distant. He flung the magneto as far out into </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">the snow as he could. It went much further than it should have. There was a </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">light puff of snow when it fell. The light breeze carried the snow granules away </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">to fresh resting places. Disperse there, I say. There's nothing to see. It's all </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">mother was still a little bit afraid, but his father's attitude was strange. It </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">probings at his father had only brought him a dim picture of something like an </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">octopus, whirling up into the hard blue sky. And on both occasions that he had </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">concentrated hard enough to get this, Daddy had suddenly been staring at him in </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">out in the sunshine, it seemed like a weight had slipped from his shoulders. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  He pulled a chair over, stood on it, and got his parka and snow pants out of </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">were in the boot box and he pulled them on, his tongue creeping out into the </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">corner of his mouth in concentration as he laced them and tied the rawhide into </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">careful granny knots. He pulled on his mittens and his ski mask and was ready. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">  He tramped out through the kitchen to the back door, then paused. He was tired </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">of playing out back, and at this time of day the hotel's shadow would be cast </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">over his play area. He didn't even like being in the Overlook's shadow. He </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">Dick Hallorann had told him to stay away from the topiary, but the thought of </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">the hedge animals did not bother him much. They were buried under snowdrifts </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">now, nothing showing but a vague hump that was the rabbit's head and the lions' </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">  Danny opened the back door and got his snowshoes from the milk platform. Five </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">minutes later he was strapping them to his feet on the front porch. His daddy </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="430" height="17" font="0">the chimneys of the play-Overlook stuck up over the snow </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  and the tops of the cement rings protruded in two places like Eskimo igloos. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">Danny tramped over there, squatted, and began to dig. Before long he had </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">uncovered the dark mouth of one of them and he slipped into the cold tunnel. In </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  The far end of the concrete ring was solidly blocked with snow. He tried </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">digging through it and was amazed (and a little uneasy) to see how solid it was, </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">almost like ice from the cold and the constant weight of more snow on top of it. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">  His make-believe game collapsed around him and he was suddenly aware that he </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">felt closed in and extremely nervous in this tight ring of cement. He could hear </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">his breathing; it sounded dank and quick and hollow. He was under the snow, and </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">hardly any light filtered down the hole he had dug to get in here. Suddenly he </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">wanted to be out in the sunlight more than anything, suddenly he remembered his </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">daddy and mommy were sleeping and didn't know there he was, that if the hole he </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="498" height="17" font="0">dug caved in he would be trapped, and the Overlook didn't like him. </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">of the concrete ring, his snowshoes clacking woodenly together behind him, his </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">palms crackling in last fall's dead aspen leaves beneath him. He had just </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">reached the end and the cold spill of light coming down from above when the snow </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">did give in, a minor fall, but enough to powder his face and clog the opening he </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  For a moment his brain froze in utter panic and he could not think. Then, as </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">had saved for just such a chance as this. Maybe a huge spider that had burrowed </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">down under the dead leaves, or a rat ... or maybe the corpse of some little </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">kid that had died here on the playground. Had that ever happened? Yes, he </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">thought maybe it had. He thought of the woman in the tub. The blood and brains </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">on the wall of the Presidential Sweet. Of some little kid, its head split open </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">from a fall from the monkey bars or a swing, crawling after him in the dark, </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">grinning, looking for one final playmate in its endless playground. Forever. In </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="261" height="17" font="0">a moment he would hear it coming. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  At the far end of the concrete ring, Danny heard the stealthy crackle of dead </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="605" height="17" font="0">leaves as something came for him on its hands and knees. At any moment he would </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="298" height="17" font="0">feel its cold hand close over his ankle —  </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  That thought broke his paralysis. He was digging at the loose fall of snow </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">that choked the end of the concrete ring, throwing it back between his legs in </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">powdery bursts like a dog digging for a bone. Blue light filtered down from </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">above and Danny thrust himself up at it like a diver coming out of deep water. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">He scraped his back on the lip of the concrete ring. One of his snowshoes </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">twisted behind the other. Snow spilled down inside his ski mask and into the </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">collar of his parka. He dug at the snow, clawed at it. It seemed to be trying to </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">hold him, to suck him back down, back into the concrete ring where that unseen, </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="388" height="17" font="0">leaf-crackling thing was, and keep him there. Forever. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  Then he was out, his face was turned up to the sun, and he was crawling </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">through the snow, crawling away from the half-buried cement ring, gasping </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">harshly, his face almost comically white with powdered snow — a living fright- </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">and get his breath. As he set them to rights and tightened the straps again, he </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">never took his eyes from the hole at the end of the concrete ring. He waited to </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">see if something would come out. Nothing did, and after three or four minutes, </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">Danny's breathing began to slow down. Whatever it was, it couldn't stand the </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">sunlight. It was cooped up down there, maybe only able to come out when it was </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">dark... or when both ends of its circular prison were plugged with snow. </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  He turned around, toward the hotel, and looked. But even before he looked </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="309" height="17" font="0">  (Can you see the Indians in this picture?) </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="605" height="17" font="0">  he knew what he would see, because he knew what that soft thumping sound had </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">been. It was the sound of a large clump of snow falling, the way it sounded when </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="384" height="17" font="0">it slid off the roof of the hotel and fell to the ground. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="148" height="17" font="0">  (Can you see — ?) </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">an incongruous splash of green in all the eye-watering whiteness. It was sitting </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="245" height="17" font="0">up, as if to beg a sweet or a scrap. </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  But this time he wouldn't go crazy, he wouldn't blow his cool. Because at </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">was just a dog. It's pretty warm out today, he thought hopefully. Maybe the sun </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">just melted enough snow off that old dog so the rest fell off in a bunch. Maybe </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="98" height="17" font="0">that's all it is. </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">  His snowshoe bindings were as tight as they were ever going to be. He stood up </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">and stared back at the concrete ring, almost completely submerged in the snow, </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">and what he saw at the end he had exited from froze his heart. There was a </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">circular patch of darkness at the end of it, a fold of shadow that marked the </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">hole he'd dug to get down inside. Now, in spite of the snow-dazzle, he thought </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="611" height="17" font="0">he could see something there. Something moving. A hand. The waving hand of some </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">desperately unhappy child, waving hand, pleading hand, drowning hand. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  (Save me O please save me If you can't save me at least come play with me... </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No,&#34; Danny whispered huskily. The word fell dry and bare from his mouth, </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">which was stripped of moisture. He could feel his mind wavering now, trying to </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">go away the way it had when the woman in the room had ... no, better not think </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="56" height="17" font="0">of that. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  He grasped at the strings of reality and held them tightly. He had to get out </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">of here. Concentrate on that. Be cool. Be like the Secret Agent Man. Would </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="219" height="17" font="0">  That calmed him somewhat. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  From behind him, that soft Hump sound of falling snow came again. He turned </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">around and the head of one of the hedge lions was sticking out of the snow now, </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">snarling at him. It was closer than it should have been, almost up to the gate </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="136" height="17" font="0">of the playground. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  Terror tried to rise up and he quelled it. He was the Secret Agent Man, and he </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="105" height="17" font="0">would escape. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  He began to walk out of the playground, taking the same roundabout course his </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">father had taken on the day that the snow flew. He concentrated on operating the </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">snowshoes. Slow, flat strides. Don't lift your foot too high or you'll lose your </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">balance. Twist your ankle and spill the snow off the crisscrossed lacings. It </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">seemed so slow. He reached the corner of the playground. The snow was drifted </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">high here and he was able to step over the fence. He got halfway over and then </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">almost fell flat when the snowshoe on his behind foot caught on one of the fence </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="503" height="17" font="0">posts. He leaned on the outside edge of gravity, pinwheeling his arms, </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="436" height="17" font="0">remembering how hard it was to get up once you fell down. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  From his right, that soft sound again, falling clumps of snow. He looked over </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">and saw the other two lions, clear of snow now down to their forepaws, side by </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">side, about sixty paces away. The green indentations that were their eyes were </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="311" height="17" font="0">fixed on him. The dog had turned its head. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="321" height="17" font="0">  (It only happens when you're not looking.) </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">uselessly. More snow got inside his hood and down his neck and into the tops of </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">his boots. He struggled out of the snow and tried to get the snowshoes under </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  and overbalanced backward. For a moment he lay there looking at the sky, </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="321" height="17" font="0">thinking it would be simpler to just give up. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  Then he thought of the thing in the concrete tunnel and knew he could not. He </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">gained his feet and stared over at the topiary. All three lions were bunched </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">together now, not forty feet away. The dog had ranged off to their left, as if </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">to block Danny's retreat. They were bare of snow except for powdery ruffs around </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="389" height="17" font="0">their necks and muzzles. They were all staring at him. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  His breath was racing now, and the panic was like a rat behind his forehead, </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">twisting and gnawing. He fought the panic and he fought the snowshoes. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  (Daddy's voice: No, don't fight them, doc. Walk on them like they were your </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="112" height="17" font="0">  (Yes, Daddy.) </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  He began to walk again, trying to regain the easy rhythm he had practiced with </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">his daddy. Little by little it began to come, but with the rhythm came an </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">awareness of just how tired he was, how much his fear had exhausted him. The </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">tendons of his thighs and calves and ankles were hot and trembly. Ahead he could </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">see the Overlook, mockingly distant, seeming to stare at him with its many </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">windows, as if this were some sort of contest in which it was mildly interested. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  Danny looked back over his shoulder and his hurried breathing caught for a </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">moment and then hurried on even faster. The nearest lion was now only twenty </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">feet behind, breasting through the snow like a dog paddling in a pond. The two </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">others were to its right and left, pacing it. They were like an army platoon on </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="503" height="17" font="0">patrol, the dog, still off to their left, the scout. The closest lion had its </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">head down. The shoulders bunched powerfully above its neck. The tail was up, as </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">if in the instant before he had turned to look it had been swishing back and </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">forth, back and forth. He thought it looked like a great big housecat that was </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="416" height="17" font="0">having a good time playing with a mouse before killing it. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="125" height="17" font="0">  ( — falling — ) </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">  No, if he fell he was dead. They would never let him get up. They would </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">pounce. He pinwheeled his arms madly and lunged ahead, his center of gravity </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">dancing just beyond his nose. He caught it and hurried on, snapping glances back </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">over his shoulder. The air whistled in and out of his dry throat like hot glass. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">  The world closed down to the dazzling snow, the green hedges, and the whispery </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">sound of his snowshoes. And something else. A soft, muffled padding sound. He </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">tried to hurry faster and couldn't. He was walking over the buried driveway now, </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">a small boy with his face almost buried in the shadow of his parka hood. The </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="217" height="17" font="0">afternoon was still and bright. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  When he looked back again, the point lion was only five feet behind. It was </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">grinning. Its mouth was open, its haunches tensed down like a clockspring. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">Behind it and the others he could see the rabbit, its head now sticking out of </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">the snow, bright green, as if it had turned its horrid blank face to watch the </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="119" height="17" font="0">end of the stalk. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  Now, on the Overlook's front lawn between the circular drive and the porch, he </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="502" height="17" font="0">like a blind man feeling for obstacles. His hood fell back, revealing his </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="406" height="17" font="0">eyes bulging with terror. The porch was very close now. </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  Behind him he heard the sudden hard crunch of snow as something leaped. </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  He fell on the porch steps, screaming without sound, and scrambled up them on </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  There was a slashing sound in the air and sudden pain in his leg. The ripping </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">sound of cloth. Something else that might have — must have — been in his mind. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="168" height="17" font="0">  Bellowing, angry roar. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="227" height="17" font="0">  Smell of blood and evergreen. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">  He fell full-length on the porch, sobbing hoarsely, the rich, metallic taste </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">of copper in his mouth. His heart was thundering in his chest. There was a small </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="278" height="17" font="0">trickle of blood coming from his nose. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">  He had no idea how long he lay there before the lobby doors flew open and Jack </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">ran out, wearing just his jeans and a pair of slippers. Wendy was behind him. </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  Daddy was helping him up. Below the knee his snowpants were ripped open. </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="617" height="17" font="0">and when would you be back? NO ONE KNOWS. His parka and snowpants and the </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  And he thought he could do that, but he couldn't stop shaking. He looked into </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">the fire and waited for Daddy to say something. High yellow flames danced on the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">dark stone hearth. A pine-knot exploded with a bang and sparks rushed up the </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="616" height="17" font="0">  Danny had known what he would see even before he got to the window. Below the </text>

<text top="653" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">exercise area, the snowfield that covered the Overlook's lawns sloped down to </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">the topiary and the playground beyond. It was marred by two sets of tracks, one </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="254" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Only my tracks, Daddy. But — &#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="257" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What about the hedges, Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  Danny's lips began to tremble. He was going to cry. What if he couldn't stop? </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="424" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All covered with snow,&#34; he whispered. &#34;But, Daddy — &#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="220" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What? I couldn't hear you!&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="506" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Jack, you're cross-examining him! Can't you see he's upset, he's — &#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="192" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Shut up! Well, Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="303" height="17" font="0">  &#34;They scratched me, Daddy. My leg — &#34; </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="410" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You must have cut your leg on the crust of the snow.&#34; </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">make him do?&#34; she asked him. &#34;Confess to murder? What's wrong with you?&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  The strangeness in his eyes seemed to break then. &#34;I'm trying to help him find </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">hallucination, that's all.&#34; He squatted by Danny so they were on an eye-to-eye </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">level, and then hugged him tight. &#34;Danny, it didn't really happen. Okay? It was </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">intently, his face strained and anxious. He had been catching the drift of her </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">thoughts, she realized. Just how much or how little of them he was getting was </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">impossible to say, but she flushed, feeling much the same as if he had caught </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">screeching sound as the elevator car came to an instant standstill. For a moment </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">the declutched motor in the basement whined even louder, and then its circuit </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">breaker cut in and the Overlook went unearthly still. The night wind outside </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">seemed very loud by comparison. Jack looked stupidly at the gray metal elevator </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">door. There were three splotches of blood below the keyhole from his lacerated </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="614" height="17" font="0">  He turned back to Wendy and Danny for a moment. She was sitting up, and Danny </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">had his arm around her. They were both staring at him carefully, as if he was a </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">stranger they had never seen before, possibly a dangerous one. He opened his </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="244" height="17" font="0">  She said clearly: &#34;Fuck your job&#34; </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">  He turned back to the elevator, worked his fingers into the crack that ran </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">down the right side of the door, and got it to open a little way. Then he was </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="432" height="17" font="0">able to get his whole weight on it and threw the door open. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  The car had stopped halfway, its floor at Jack's chest level. Warm light still </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="503" height="17" font="0">spilled out of it, contrasting with the oily darkness of the shaft below. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="320" height="17" font="0">  He looked in for what seemed a long time. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's empty,&#34; he said then. &#34;A short circuit, like I said.&#34; He hooked his </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">fingers into the slot behind the door and began to pull it closed ... then her </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="466" height="17" font="0">hand was on his shoulder, surprisingly strong, yanking him away. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Wendy!&#34; he shouted. But she had already caught the car's bottom edge and </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">pulled herself up enough so she could look in. Then, with a convulsive heave of </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">her shoulder and belly muscles, she tried to boost herself all the way up. For a </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">moment the issue was in doubt. Her feet tottered over the blackness of the shaft </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="458" height="17" font="0">and one pink slipper fell from her foot and slipped out of sight. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="221" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mommy!&#34; Danny screamed. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  Then she was up, her cheeks flushed, her forehead as pale and shining as a </text>

<text top="874" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">something and suddenly the hall was full of drifting confetti, red and white and </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="95" height="17" font="0">  &#34;And this?&#34; </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  She tossed it out and it came to rest on the blue-black jungle carpet, a black </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="398" height="17" font="0">silk cat's-eye mask, dusted with sequins at the temples. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Does that look like a short circuit to you, Jack?&#34; she screamed at him. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  Jack stepped slowly away from it, shaking his head mechanically back and </text>

<text top="674" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">axis bar with a pair of meshing cogs at either end. The hands of the clock stood </text>
<text top="694" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">at quarter past XI, and although he didn't know Roman numerals he could guess by </text>
<text top="714" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">the configuration of the hands at what time the clock had stopped. The clock </text>
<text top="734" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">stood on a velvet base. In front of it, slightly distorted by the curve of the </text>
<text top="754" left="99" width="287" height="17" font="0">dome, was a carefully carved silver key. </text>
<text top="774" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  He supposed that the clock was one of the things he wasn't supposed to touch, </text>
<text top="794" left="99" width="508" height="17" font="0">like the decorative fire-tools in their brass-bound cabinet by the lobby </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="472" height="17" font="0">fireplace or the tall china highboy at the back of the dining room. </text>
<text top="835" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  A sense of injustice and a feeling of angry rebellion suddenly rose in him and </text>

<text top="895" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">  It had. And it hadn't been particularly careful not to break him, either. </text>
<text top="915" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">  Danny put his hands out, grasped the glass dome, and lifted it aside. He let </text>
<text top="935" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">one finger play over the works for a moment, the pad of his index finger denting </text>
<text top="955" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">against the cogs, running smoothly over the wheels. He picked up the silver key. </text>
<text top="975" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">For an adult it would have been uncomfortably small, but it fitted his own </text>
<text top="995" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">fingers perfectly. He placed it in the keyhole at the center of the clockface. </text>
<text top="1015" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">It went firmly home with a tiny click, more felt than heard. It wound to the </text>
<text top="1036" left="99" width="194" height="17" font="0">right, of course; clockwise. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Danny turned the key until it would turn no more and then removed it. The </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">semicircles. The hands were moving. If you kept your head perfectly motionless </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">and your eyes wide open, you could see the minute hand inching along toward its </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="304" height="17" font="0">  (And the Red Death held sway over all.) </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">  He frowned, and then shook the thought away. It was a thought with no meaning </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  He reached his index finger out again and pushed the minute band up to the </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">hour, curious about what might happen. It obviously wasn't a cuckoo clock, but </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="294" height="17" font="0">that steel rail had to have some purpose. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  There was a small, ratcheting series of clicks, and then the clock began to </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">From behind the clockface two figures glided into view along the steel track, </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">ballet dancers, on the left a girl in a fluffy skirt and white stockings, on the </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">right a boy in a black leotard and ballet slippers. Their hands were held in </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">arches over their beads. They came together in the middle, in front of VI. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  Danny espied tiny grooves in their sides, just below their armpits. The axis </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">bar slipped into these grooves and he heard another small click. The cogs at </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">either end of the bar began to turn. &#34;The Blue Danube&#34; tinkled. The dancers' </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">arms came down around each other. The boy flipped the girl up over his head and </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">then whirled over the bar. They were now lying prone, the boy's head buried </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="488" height="17" font="0">beneath the girl's short ballet skirt, the girl's face pressed against the </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="467" height="17" font="0">center of the boy's leotard. They writhed in a mechanical frenzy. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  Danny's nose wrinkled. They were kissing peepees. That made him feel sick. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="608" height="17" font="0">  A moment later and things began to run backward. The boy whirled back over the </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">axis bar. He flipped the girl into an upright position. They seemed to nod </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">knowingly at each other as their hands arched back over their heads. They </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">retreated the way they had come, disappearing just as &#34;The Blue Danube&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="429" height="17" font="0">finished. The clock began to strike a count of silver chimes. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="243" height="17" font="0">  (Midnight! Stroke of midnight!) </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="159" height="17" font="0">  (Hooray for masks!) </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  Danny whirled on the chair, almost falling down. The ballroom was empty. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">Beyond the double cathedral window he could see fresh snow beginning to sift </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">red and gold embroidery, lay undisturbed on the floor. Spaced around it were </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">small, intimate tables for two, the spidery chairs that went with each upended </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="233" height="17" font="0">with legs pointing at the ceiling. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="220" height="17" font="0">  The whole place was empty. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  But it wasn't really empty. Because here in the Overlook things just went on </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">and on. Here in the Overlook all times were one. There was an endless night in </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">August of 1945, with laughter and drinks and a chosen shining few going up and </text>

<text top="974" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">other's faces. It was a not-yet-light morning in June some twenty years later </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">  With a trembling sigh, he looked at the clockface. Cogs turned and meshed with </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">It was Hallorann, Danny saw. Dressed in his cook's whites instead of the blue </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">up and up and up. Danny scrambled backward, screaming, and suddenly he was </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">through the wall and falling, tumbling over and over, down the hole, down the </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">birds. He articulated his own proposal that all persons of Negro blood return to </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">their native continent. He expressed his sincere belief in the position the </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">limo-driver's soul would occupy in the afterlife. He finished by saying that he </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">tooling along the soft shoulder at better than fifty miles an hour. He guided it </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">back onto the road, feeling the rear end fishtail for a moment before regaining </text>

<text top="874" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">pulled into a parking slot, took his handkerchief out of his pocket, and mopped </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">headache, as if his brain had been twisted and wrung out and hung up to dry. </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">Like the headache he'd gotten from letting that boy Danny shine at him up there </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  He looked down at his arms. Hot sunshine lay on them but they had still goose- </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="217" height="17" font="0">And now the boy was calling. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  He suddenly wondered how he could have left that boy up there at all, shining </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  He suddenly keyed the limo, put it in reverse, and pulled back onto the </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">conversing with his bookie. He wanted the four-horse at Rockaway. No, no parlay, </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">no quinella, no exacta, no goddam futura. Just the little old four, six hundred </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">playing the Bills? Didn't he know who the Jets were playing? Five hundred, </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">seven-point spread. When Queems hung up, looking put-out, Hallorann understood </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">suits with shiny seats. He regarded Hallorann with an eye that was still </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="473" height="17" font="0">bloodshot from too many glances into last night's bourbon bottle. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="143" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Problems, Dick?&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="411" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir, Mr. Queems, I guess so. I need three days off.&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  There was a package of Kents in the breast pocket of Queems's sheer yellow </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">out, and bit down morosely on the patented Micronite filter. He lit it with his </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="340" height="17" font="0">  &#34;So do I,&#34; he said. &#34;But what's on your mind?&#34; </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Shot!&#34; Queems said. He put his Kent down in an ashtray which bore the emblem </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">from his pocket and flashed it before Queems's bloodshot eyes. He put it back in </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="439" height="17" font="0">doubted if the potboy could hit the urinal on the first squirt. </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  And sometimes that light, that shine, seemed like a pretty nice thing. You </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">could pick the horses, or like the boy had said, you could tell your daddy where </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">his trunk was when it turned up missing. But that was only dressing, the sauce </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">on the salad, and down below there was as much bitter vetch in that salad as </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">there was cool cucumber. You could taste pain and death and tears. And now the </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">boy was stuck in that place, and he would go. For the boy. Because, speaking to </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">the boy, they had only been different colors when they used their mouths. So he </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">would go. He would do what he could, because if he didn't, the boy was going to </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="177" height="17" font="0">die right inside his head. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  But because he was human he could not help a bitter wish that the cup had </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann hadn't liked Delores much, but he had gone up to look that evening. </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">The maid was an olive-complected girl of twenty-three who waited tables near the </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">wearing a faded cloth coat, would come in for dinner and Delores would trade one </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="505" height="17" font="0">of her tables for theirs. The mousy little man would leave a picture of </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">Alexander Hamilton under his plate, bad enough for the girl who had made the </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">trade, but worse, Delores would crow over it. She was lazy, a goof-off in an </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">operation run by a man who allowed no goof-offs. She would sit in a linen </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">closet, reading a confession magazine and smoking, but whenever Ullman went on </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">one of his unscheduled prowls (and woe to the girl he caught resting her feet) </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">he found her working industriously, her magazine hidden under the sheets on a </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">high shelf, her ashtray tucked safely into her uniform pocket. Yeah, Hallorann </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">thought, she'd been a goof-off and a sloven and the other girls had resented </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">her, but Delores had had that little twinkle. It had always greased the skids </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">for her. But what she had seen in 217 had scared her badly enough so she was </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">more than glad to pick up the walking papers Ullman had issued her and go. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">  Why had she come to him? A shine knows a shine, Hallorann thought, grinning at </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  So he had gone up that night and had let himself into the room, which was to </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">be reoccupied the next day. He had used the office passkey to get in, and if </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="612" height="17" font="0">Ullman had caught him with that key, he would have joined Delores Vickery on the </text>

<text top="673" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">even before he did he'd had a premonition of what he was going to see. Mrs. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">Massey, swollen and purple, lay soggily in the tub, which was half-full of </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">water. He had stood looking down at her, a pulse beating thickly in his throat. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">There had been other things at the Overlook: a bad dream that recurred at </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">irregular intervals — some sort of costume party and he was catering it in the </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">Overlook's ballroom and at the shout to unmask, everybody exposed faces that </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">were those of rotting insects — and there had been the hedge animals. Twice, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">maybe three times, he had (or thought he had) seen them move, ever so slightly. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">That dog would seem to change from his sitting-up posture to a slightly crouched </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">one, and the lions seemed to move forward, as if menacing the little tykes on </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">the ornate set of firetools that now stood beside the lobby fireplace. While he </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">had been up there the three lightbulbs strung overhead had gone out and he had </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">lost his way back to the trapdoor. He had stumbled around for an unknown length </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">of time, closer and closer to panic, barking his shins on boxes and bumping into </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">things, with a stronger and stronger feeling that something was stalking him in </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">the dark. Some great and frightening creature that had just oozed out of the </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">woodwork when the lights went out. And when he had literally stumbled over the </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">trapdoor's ringbolt he had hurried down as fast as he could, leaving the trap </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">open, sooty and disheveled, with a feeling of disaster barely averted. Later </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">didn't know if that could be attributed to the Overlook's deadly siren song or </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">not — word had gone around among the help that the child, the only daughter of a </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">would have to be watched more closely than ever. It might have been seriously </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">weakened. He wouldn't trust it at more than one hundred psi for the rest of the </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">winter. And if they were a little chilly, they would just have to grin and bear </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">just it, by God. An anesthetic. He had done his duty and now he could use a </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="369" height="17" font="0">  He remembered bottles glittering in the shadows. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  He had saved the hotel. The hotel would want to reward him. He felt sure of </text>

<text top="393" left="99" width="395" height="17" font="0">  Mommy had said: &#34;Look, Danny, look at the hedges.&#34; </text>

<text top="453" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">dismembered corpses. And then his daddy had burst out of the Overlook's big </text>
<text top="473" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">double doors, and he was burning like a torch. His clothes were in flames, his </text>

<text top="533" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  That was when he woke up, his throat tight with fear, his hands clutching at </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">sort of silvery, spangled costume. A dog costume, Danny realized. Protruding </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">from the rump of this strange creation was a long and floppy tail with a puff on </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">the end. A zipper ran up the back of the costume to the neck. To the left of him </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">was a dog's or wolf's head, blank eyesockets above the muzzle, the mouth open in </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="251" height="17" font="0">that appeared to be papier-mache. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="482" height="17" font="0">  The man's mouth and chin and cheeks were smeared with blood. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  He began to growl at Danny. He was grinning, but the growl was real. It was </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">deep in his throat, a chilling primitive sound. Then he began to bark. His teeth </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">were also stained red. He began to crawl toward Danny, dragging his boneless </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">tail behind him. The costume dog's head lay unheeded on the carpet, glaring </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="231" height="17" font="0">vacantly over Danny's shoulder. </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="191" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Let me by,&#34; Danny said. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'm going to eat you, little boy,&#34; the dogman answered, and suddenly a </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">fusillade of barks came from his grinning mouth. They were human imitations, but </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">the savagery in them was real. The man's hair was dark, greased with sweat from </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">his confining costume. There was a mixture of scotch and champagne on his </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="364" height="17" font="0">  Danny flinched back but didn't run. &#34;Let me by.&#34; </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin,&#34; the dogman replied. His small red </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">eyes were fixed attentively on Danny's face. He continued to grin. &#34;I'm going to </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">eat you up, little boy. And I think I'll start with your plump little cock.&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  He began to prance skittishly forward, making little leaps and snarling. </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="293" height="17" font="0">  Danny stood in the hallway, trembling. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Get it up!&#34; the drunken dogman cried out from around the corner. His voice </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">was both violent and despairing. &#34;Get it up, Harry you bitch-bastard! I don't </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">His mommy was sleeping in exactly the same position. No one was hearing this but </text>

<text top="994" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">on the walls of the Presidential Suite had been gone. He peeked around the </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">controlling those things and they could hurt. The Overlook hadn't wanted him to </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">go to his father. That might spoil all the fun. So it had put the dogman in his </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  Jack stood in the dining room just outside the batwing doors leading into the </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="490" height="17" font="0">Colorado Lounge, his head cocked, listening. He was smiling faintly. </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="463" height="17" font="0">  Around him, he could hear the Overlook Hotel coming to life. </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="505" height="17" font="0">  It was hard to say just how he knew, but he guessed it wasn't greatly </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">different from the perceptions Danny had from time to time ... like father, </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="390" height="17" font="0">like son. Wasn't that how it was popularly expressed? </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  It wasn't a perception of sight or sound, although it was very near to those </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">things, separated from those senses by the filmiest of perceptual curtains. It </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">was as if another Overlook now lay scant inches beyond this one, separated from </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">the real world (if there is such a thing as a &#34;real world,&#34; Jack thought) but </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">gradually coming into balance with it. He was reminded of the 3-D movies he'd </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">seen as a kid. If you looked at the screen without the special glasses, you saw </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">a double image — the sort of thing he was feeling now. But when you put the </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="181" height="17" font="0">glasses on, it made sense. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  All the hotel's eras were together now, all but this current one, the Torrance </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">Era. And this would be together with the rest very soon now. That was good. That </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  He could almost hear the self-important ding!ding! of the silver-plated bell </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">on the registration desk, summoning bellboys to the front as men in the </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">fashionable flannels of the 1920s checked in and men in fashionable 1940s </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">double-breasted pinstripes checked out. There would be three nuns sitting in </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">front of the fireplace as they waited for the check-out line to thin, and </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">standing behind them, nattily dressed with diamond stickpins holding their blue- </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">and-white-figured ties, Charles Grondin and Vito Gienelli discussed profit and </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">loss, life and death. There were a dozen trucks in the loading bays out back, </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">some laid one over the other like bad time exposures. In the east-wing ballroom, </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">a dozen different business conventions were going on at the same time within </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">temporal centimeters of each other. There was a costume ball going on. There </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">were soirees, wedding receptions, birthday and anniversary parties. Men talking </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">about Neville Chamberlain and the Archduke of Austria. Music. Laughter. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">Drunkenness. Hysteria. Little love, not here, but a steady undercurrent of </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">sensuousness. And he could almost hear all of them together, drifting through </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">the hotel and making a graceful cacophony. In the dining room where he stood, </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="483" height="17" font="0">breakfast, lunch, and dinner for seventy years were all being served </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">simultaneously just behind him. He could almost ... no, strike the almost. He </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">could hear them, faintly as yet, but clearly — the way one can hear thunder miles </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">off on a hot summer's day. He could hear all of them, the beautiful strangers. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="616" height="17" font="0">He was becoming aware of them as they must have been aware of him from the very </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="442" height="17" font="0">  All the rooms of the Overlook were occupied this morning. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="106" height="17" font="0">  A full house. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">  And beyond the batwings, a low murmur of conversation drifted and swirled like </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">lazy cigarette smoke. More sophisticated, more private. Low, throaty female </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">laughter, the kind that seems to vibrate in a fairy ring around the viscera and </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="527" height="17" font="0">the genitals. The sound of a cash register, its window softly lighted in the </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">warm halfdark, ringing up the price of a gin rickey, a Manhattan, a depression </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">bomber, a sloe gin fizz, a zombie. The jukebox, pouring out its drinkers' </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Good evening, Mr. Torrance,&#34; Lloyd said, genuinely pleased. &#34;It's good to see </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's good to be back, Lloyd,&#34; he said gravely, and hooked his leg over a </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="423" height="17" font="0">dress who was peering into the depths of a singapore sling. </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="247" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What will it be, Mr. Torrance?&#34; </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Martini,&#34; he said with great pleasure. He looked at the backbar with its rows </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">of dimly gleaming bottles, capped with their silver siphons. Jim Beam. Wild </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">Turkey. Gilby's. Sharrod's Private Label. Toro. Seagram's. And home again. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  &#34;One large martian, if you please,&#34; he said. &#34;They've landed somewhere in the </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">world, Lloyd.&#34; He took his wallet out and laid a twenty carefully on the bar. </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  As Lloyd made his drink, Jack looked over his shoulder. Every booth was </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">occupied. Some of the occupants were dressed in costumes ... a woman in gauzy </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">harem pants and a rhinestone-sparkled brassiere, a man with a foxhead rising </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">slyly out of his evening dress, a man in a silvery dog outfit who was tickling </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">the nose of a woman in a sarong with the puff on the end of his long tail, to </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="215" height="17" font="0">the general amusement of all. </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No charge to you, Mr. Torrance,&#34; Lloyd said, putting the drink down on Jack's </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="474" height="17" font="0">twenty. &#34;Your money is no good here. Orders from the manager.&#34; </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="95" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Manager?&#34; </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">  A faint unease came over him; nevertheless he picked up the martini glass and </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">swirled it, watching the olive at the bottom bob slightly in the drink's chilly </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="56" height="17" font="0">depths. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Of course. The manager.&#34; Lloyd's smile broadened, but his eyes were socketed </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">in shadow and his skin was horribly white, like the skin of a corpse. &#34;Later he </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">expects to see to your son's well-being himself. He is very interested in your </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="215" height="17" font="0">son. Danny is a talented boy.&#34; </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  The juniper fumes of the gin were pleasantly maddening, but they also seemed </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">to be blurring his reason. Danny? What was all of this about Danny? And what was </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="306" height="17" font="0">he doing in a bar with a drink in his hand? </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="682" height="17" font="0">  He had TAKEN THE PLEDGE. He had GONE ON THE WAGON. He had SWORN OFF. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="627" height="17" font="0">  What could they want with his son? What could they want with Danny? Wendy and </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">Danny weren't in it. He tried to see into Lloyd's shadowed eyes, but it was too </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">dark, too dark, it was like trying to read emotion into the empty orbs of a </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="42" height="17" font="0">skull. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  (It's me they must want ... isn't it? I am the one. Not Danny, not Wendy. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">I'm the one who loves it here. They wanted to leave. I'm the one who took care </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="470" height="17" font="0">the boiler ... lied ... practically sold my soul ... what can they want </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="84" height="17" font="0">with him?) </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Where is the manager?&#34; He tried to ask it casually but his words seemed to </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">come out between lips already numbed by the first drink, like words from a </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="334" height="17" font="0">nightmare rather than those in a sweet dream. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="146" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd only smiled. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What do you want with my son? Danny's not in this ... is he?&#34; He heard the </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd's face seemed to be running, changing, becoming something pestilent. The </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">white skin becoming a hepatitic yellow, cracking. Red sores erupting on the </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">skin, bleeding foul smelling liquid. Droplets of blood sprang out on Lloyd's </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">forehead like sweat and somewhere a silver chime was striking the quarter-hour. </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="156" height="17" font="0">  (Unmask, unmask!) </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Drink your drink, Mr. Torrance,&#34; Lloyd said softly. &#34;It isn't a matter that </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  He picked his drink up again, raised it to his lips, and hesitated. He heard </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">the hard, horrible snap as Danny's arm broke. He saw the bicycle flying brokenly </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">up over the hood of Al's car, starring the windshield. He saw a single wheel </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">lying in the road, twisted spokes pointing into the sky like jags of piano wire. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="388" height="17" font="0">  He became aware that all conversation had stopped. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  He looked back over his shoulder. They were all looking at him expectantly, </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">silently. The man beside the woman in the sarong had removed his foxhead and </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">Jack saw that it was Horace Derwent, his pallid blond hair spilling across his </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">forehead. Everyone at the bar was watching, too. The woman beside him was </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">looking at him closely, as if trying to focus. Her dress had slipped off one </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">shoulder and looking down he could see a loosely puckered nipple capping one </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">sagging breast. Looking back at her face he began to think that this might be </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">the woman from 217, the one who had tried to strangle Danny. On his other hand, </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">the man in the sharp blue suit had removed a small pearl-handled .32 from his </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">jacket pocket and was idly spinning it on the bar, like a man with Russian </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="154" height="17" font="0">roulette on his mind. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="100" height="17" font="0">  (I want — ) </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  He realized the words were not passing through his frozen vocal cords and </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="82" height="17" font="0">tried again. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I want to see the manager. I ... I don't think he understands. My son is </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="180" height="17" font="0">not a part of this. He ... &#34; </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mr. Torrance,&#34; Lloyd said, his voice coming with hideous gentleness from </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">inside his plague-raddled face, &#34;you will meet the manager in due time. He has, </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">in fact, decided to make you his agent in this matter. Now drink your drink.&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="269" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Drink your drink,&#34; they all echoed. </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  He picked it up with a badly trembling hand. It was raw gin. He looked into </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="246" height="17" font="0">it, and looking was like drowning. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">  The woman beside him began to sing in a flat, dead voice: &#34;Roll ... out... </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="348" height="17" font="0">the barrel ... and we'll have...  a barrel ... of fun...&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">  Lloyd picked it up. Then the man in the blue suit. The dog-man joined in, </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="261" height="17" font="0">thumping one paw against the table </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="288" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now's the time to roll the barrel — &#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Derwent added his voice to the rest. A cigarette was cocked in one corner of </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">his mouth at a jaunty angle. His right arm was around the shoulders of the woman </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">in the sarong, and his right band was gently and absently stroking her right </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">breast. He was looking at the dog-man with amused contempt as he sang. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="275" height="17" font="0">  &#34; — because the gang's ... all ... here!&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  Jack brought the drink to his mouth and downed it in three long gulps, the gin </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">highballing down his throat like a moving van in a tunnel, exploding in his </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">stomach, rebounding up to his brain in one leap where it seized hold of him with </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes, sir,&#34; Lloyd said, taking the glass. Lloyd looked perfectly normal again. </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">The olive-skinned man had put his .32 away. The woman on his right was staring </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; Jack said. &#34;He has.&#34; There was another wave of laughter from behind </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  &#34;But that's really up to your son to decide, isn't it?&#34; Grady asked, raising </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">his eyebrows. The delicate gesture went oddly with the brows themselves, which </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Up to Danny?&#34; Jack frowned at Grady. &#34;No, of course not. I wouldn't allow my </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  &#34;A dedicated man,&#34; Grady said warmly. &#34;Perhaps I put it badly, sir. Let us say </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">that your future here is contingent upon how you decide to deal with your son's </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Tuxedo Junction&#34; had just concluded and a new tune hadn't begun. His shout </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">skin suddenly felt hot all over. He became fixedly positive that everyone was </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">staring at him. They had finished with Roger and would now commence with him. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">Roll over. Sit up. Play dead. If you play the game with us, we'll play the game </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">weaving in and out of the band music, now doing a swing version of Lennon and </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">  He giggled foolishly. He looked down at his left hand and saw there was </text>

<text top="311" left="99" width="302" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Unmask! Unmask!&#34; the chant went up. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="519" height="17" font="0">  The clock began to chime delicately. Along the steel runner below the </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">fascinated, the unmasking forgotten. Clockwork whirred. Cogs turned and meshed, </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">brass warmly glowing. The balance wheel rocked back and forth precisely. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  One of the figures was a man standing on tiptoe, with what looked like a tiny </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">  The two figures slipped onto the opposing ends of a steel axis bar. Somewhere, </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">tinkling on and on, were the strains of a Strauss waltz. An insane commercial </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">jingle began to run through his mind to the tune: Buy dog food, rowf-rowf, rowf- </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  The steel mallet in the clockwork daddy's hands came down on the boy's head. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">The clockwork son crumpled forward. The mallet rose and fell, rose and fell. The </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">own crumbling mind. From time to time, like a radio signal fading in and out, </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="616" height="17" font="0">she had heard — or thought she had — other voices, and music, and laughter. At one </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="623" height="17" font="0">moment she would hear Jack holding a conversation with someone named Grady (the </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">name was vaguely familiar to her but she made no actual connection), making </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">statements and asking questions into silence, yet speaking loudly, as if to make </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">himself heard over a steady background racket. And then, eerily, other sounds </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="605" height="17" font="0">would be there, seeming to slip into places — a dance band, people clapping, a man </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">with an amused yet authoritative voice who seemed to be trying to persuade </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">somebody to make a speech. For a period of thirty seconds to a minute she would </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">hear this, long enough to grow faint with terror, and then it would be gone </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">again and she would only hear Jack, talking in that commanding yet slightly </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">slurred way she remembered as his drunk-speak voice. But there was nothing in </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">the hotel to drink except cooking sherry. Wasn't that right? Yes, but if she </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">could imagine that the hotel was full of voices and music, couldn't Jack imagine </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="141" height="17" font="0">that he was drunk? </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="290" height="17" font="0">  She didn't like that thought. Not at all. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">  Wendy reached the lobby and looked around. The velvet rope that had cordoned </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">off the ballroom had been taken down; the steel post it had been clipped to had </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">been knocked over, as if someone had carelessly bumped it going by. Mellow white </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">light fell through the open door onto the lobby rug from the ballroom's high, </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="608" height="17" font="0">narrow windows. Heart thumping, she went to the open ballroom doors and looked </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">in. It was empty and silent, the only sound that curious subaural echo that </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">waking nightmare. She was soft. When trouble came, she slept. Her past was </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">unremarkable. She had never been tried in fire. Now the trial was upon her, not </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="475" height="17" font="0">  Clutching the haft of the knife tighter, she peered over the desk. </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  She went across to the pantry, shot the bolt back, and stepped inside. She got </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">a can of tomato soup and closed the pantry door again, and bolted it. The door </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">was tight against the floor. If you kept it bolted, you didn't have to worry </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">  The word stunned her so completely that she made no effort to move when he let </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">left arm had swept around her, pinning her arm against her side. She could smell </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="294" height="17" font="0">sharp gin and the sour odor of his sweat. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Have to be punished,&#34; he was grunting. &#34;Chastised. Chastised ... harshly.&#34; </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">  As her breath stopped, pure panic took over. His left hand joined his right </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">and now the knife was free to her own hand, but she forgot about it. Both of her </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="514" height="17" font="0">hands came up and began to yank helplessly at his larger, stronger ones. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="631" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Mommy!&#34; Danny shrieked from somewhere. &#34;Daddy, stop! You're hurting Mommyl&#34; </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">He screamed piercingly, a high and crystal sound that she heard from far off. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  Red flashes of light leaped in front of her eyes like ballet dancers. The room </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">grew darker. She saw her son clamber up on the bar and throw himself at Jack's </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">shoulders. Suddenly one of the hands that had been crushing her throat was gone </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">as Jack cuffed Danny away with a snarl. The boy fell back against the empty </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">shelves and dropped to the floor, dazed. The hand was on her throat again. The </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="227" height="17" font="0">red flashes began to turn black. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Danny was crying weakly. Her chest was burning. Jack was shouting into her </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  But all sounds were fading down a long dark corridor. Her struggles began to </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">weaken. One of her hands fell away from his and dropped slowly until the arm was </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">stretched out at right angles to her body, the hand dangling limply from the </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="305" height="17" font="0">wrist like the hand of a drowning woman. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">  It touched a bottle — one of the straw-wrapped wine bottles that served as </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">  Sightlessly, with the last of her strength, she groped for the bottle's neck </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="447" height="17" font="0">and found it, feeling the greasy beads of wax against her hand. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="173" height="17" font="0">  (and U God if it slips) </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  She brought it up and then down, praying for aim, knowing that if it only </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">it made a sound against his skull like a medicine ball dropped on a hardwood </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  Wendy drew a long, sobbing breath. She almost fell herself, clutched the edge </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">She could hear Danny crying, but she had no idea where he was. It sounded like </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">crying in an echo chamber. Dimly she saw dime-sized drops of blood falling to </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">the dark surface of the bar-from her nose, she thought. She cleared her throat </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">and spat on the floor. It sent a wave of agony up the column of her throat, but </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="463" height="17" font="0">the agony subsided to a steady dull press of pain...  just bearable. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="389" height="17" font="0">  Little by little, she managed to get control of herself. </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">  She let go of the bar, turned around, and saw Jack lying full-length, the </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="512" height="17" font="0">below the lounge's cash register, both hands in his mouth, staring at his </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  Pain ripping up her throat again. She winced against it. But he opened his </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="457" height="17" font="0">eyes. They looked at her warily from bluish, shadowed sockets. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  She made herself speak calmly, her eyes never leaving his. Her voice was low </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">and husky, almost a whisper. It hurt to talk. &#34;Listen to me, Danny. It wasn't </text>

<text top="894" left="99" width="471" height="17" font="0">perhaps found the only way that would bring them all safely out. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  Panting harshly, she paused a moment, holding Jack's feet against her hips. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">The surroundings reminded her of the old seafaring captain's cry in Treasure </text>
<text top="955" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">Island after old blind Pew had passed him the Black Spot: <i>he'll do em yet.</i> </text>
<text top="976" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">  And then she remembered, uncomfortably, that the old seadog had dropped dead </text>
<text top="996" left="99" width="141" height="17" font="0">mere seconds later. </text>
<text top="1016" left="99" width="394" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Are you all right, Mommy? Is he.. . is he too heavy?&#34; </text>
<text top="1036" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll manage.&#34; She began to drag him again. Danny was beside Jack. One of his </text>
<text top="1056" left="99" width="506" height="17" font="0">hands had fallen off his chest, and Danny replaced it gently, with love. </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="244" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes. It's the best thing, Danny.&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="216" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's like putting him in jail.&#34; </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="143" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Only for awhile.&#34; </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="312" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Okay, then. Are you sure you can do it?&#34; </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="57" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes.&#34; </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  But it was a near thing, at that. Danny had been cradling his father's head </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">when they went over the doorsills, but his hands slipped in Jack's greasy hair </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">as they went into the kitchen. The back of his head struck the tiles, and Jack </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="172" height="17" font="0">began to moan and stir. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You got to use smoke,&#34; Jack muttered quickly. &#34;Now run and get me that </text>

<text top="352" left="99" width="381" height="17" font="0">  Wendy and Danny exchanged tight, fearful glances. </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  For a moment Danny stood as if paralyzed by his father's face, and then he </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">moved jerkily to her side and helped her hold the left leg. They dragged him </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">across the kitchen floor in a nightmare kind of slow motion, the only sounds the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">faint, insectile buzz of the fluorescent lights and their own labored breathing. </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">  When they reached the pantry, Wendy put Jack's feet down and turned to fumble </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">with the bolt. Danny looked down at Jack, who was lying limp and relaxed again. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">The shirttail had pulled out of the back of his pants as they dragged him and </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="614" height="17" font="0">Danny wondered if Daddy was too drunk to be cold. It seemed wrong to lock him in </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">the pantry like a wild animal, but he had seen what he tried to do to Mommy. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="614" height="17" font="0">Even upstairs he had known Daddy was going to do that. He had heard them arguing </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="85" height="17" font="0">in his head. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  (If only we could all be out of here. Or if it was a dream I was having, back </text>

<text top="653" left="99" width="155" height="17" font="0">  The bolt was stuck. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  Wendy pulled at it as hard as she could, but it wouldn't move. She couldn't </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">retract the goddam bolt. It was stupid and unfair ... she had opened it with </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">no trouble at all when she had gone in to get the can of soup. Now it wouldn't </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">move, and what was she going to do? They couldn't put him in the walk-in </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">refrigerator; he would freeze or smother to death. But if they left him out and </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="105" height="17" font="0">he woke up ... </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="229" height="17" font="0">  Jack stirred again on the floor. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="356" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll take care of it,&#34; he muttered. &#34;I understand&#34; </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="327" height="17" font="0">  &#34;He's waking up, Mommy!&#34; Danny warned. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="401" height="17" font="0">  Sobbing now, she yanked at the bolt with both hands. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny?&#34; There was something softly menacing, if still blurry, in Jack's </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Just go to sleep, Daddy,&#34; Danny said nervously. &#34;It's bedtime, you know.&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  He looked up at his mother, still struggling with the bolt, and saw what was </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">wrong immediately. She had forgotten to rotate the bolt before trying to </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="371" height="17" font="0">withdraw it. The little catch was stuck in its notch. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Here,&#34; he said low, and brushed her trembling hands aside; his own were </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">shaking almost as badly. He knocked the catch loose with the heel of his hand </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="218" height="17" font="0">and the bolt drew back easily. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Quick,&#34; he said. He looked down. Jack's eyes bad fluttered open again and </text>

<text top="1117" left="99" width="5" height="16" font="0"> </text>
<text top="110" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">this time Daddy was looking directly at him, his gaze strangely flat and </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="88" height="17" font="0">speculative. </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You copied it,&#34; Daddy told him. &#34;I know you did, But it's here somewhere. And </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">  Wendy pushed the pantry door open with her knee, hardly noticing the pungent </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">odor of dried fruit that wafted out. She picked up Jack's feet again and dragged </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">him in. She was gasping harshly now, at the limit of her strength. As she yanked </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="512" height="17" font="0">the chain pull that turned on the light, Jack's eyes fluttered open again. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="395" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What are you doing? Wendy? What are you doing?&#34; </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="174" height="17" font="0">  She stepped over him. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">  He was quick; amazingly quick. One hand lashed out and she had to sidestep and </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">nearly fall out the door to avoid his grasp. Still, he had caught a handful of </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">her bathrobe and there was a heavy purring noise as it ripped. He was up on his </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">hands and knees now, his hair hanging in his eyes, like some heavy animal. A </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="151" height="17" font="0">large dog ... or a lion. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Damn you both, I know what you want. But you're not going to get it. This </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  He pushed the heavy wooden door shut with a slam, just as Jack leaped. The </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="362" height="17" font="0">door latched and Jack thudded uselessly against it. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  Danny's small hands groped at the bolt. Wendy was too far away to help; the </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">issue of whether he would be locked in or free was going to be decided in two </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">seconds. Danny missed his grip, found it again, and shot the bolt across just as </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">the latch began to jiggle madly up and down below it. Then it stayed up and </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">there was a series of thuds as Jack slammed his shoulder against the door. The </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">bolt, a quarter inch of steel in diameter, showed no signs of loosening. Wendy </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="185" height="17" font="0">let her breath out slowly. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Let me out of here!&#34; Jack raged. &#34;Let me out! Danny, doggone it, this is your </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">  Danny's hand moved automatically toward the bolt. Wendy caught it and pressed </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You mind your daddy, Danny! You do what I say! You do it or I'll give you a </text>

<text top="773" left="99" width="320" height="17" font="0">  Danny looked at her, pale as window glass. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  They could hear his breath tearing in and out behind the half inch of solid </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">  Danny moaned. Wendy looked at him and saw he was going to faint in a moment. </text>

<text top="974" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Come hack here and let me out right NOW!&#34; Jack screamed. There was a </text>

<text top="1035" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's the hotel,&#34; Danny said. &#34;It's the hotel. I remember.&#34; But he looked back </text>

<text top="533" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">of his rage carried perfectly up the dumb-waiter shaft: Mommy's face was pale, </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">symptoms were there, too: his mouth tasted like a manure rake had taken a swing </text>
<text top="835" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">through it, his ears rung, his heart had an extra-heavy, thudding beat, like a </text>

<text top="875" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">against the door and his throat felt raw and peeled from useless shouting. He </text>
<text top="895" left="99" width="288" height="17" font="0">had cut his right hand on the doorlatch. </text>

<text top="452" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">manager, in time. She was trying to deny him Danny, and Danny was his ticket of </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">admission. That was foolish, of course — why would they want the son when they </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="149" height="17" font="0">  The feeling passed. </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  There was no answer. He became aware that all sounds had stopped except for </text>

<text top="733" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  Standing on top of it was a martini glass, a fifth of gin, and a plastic dish </text>

<text top="594" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">scooted forward and toward the right. There was no embankment over here; the </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">  She hesitated again, miserably caught, not wanting to leave Danny and the </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">her aware that she was leaving her sleeping son behind, alone and unprotected. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">The sound of her slippers against the carpet seemed louder and louder in her </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  She reached the stairwell and put her hand on the cold newel post at the top </text>

<text top="994" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">Jack crouching on any one of them. Of course not. Jack was locked in the pantry </text>

<text top="1035" left="99" width="370" height="17" font="0">  But the lobby was dark and oh so full of shadows. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="389" height="17" font="0">  Her pulse thudded steadily and deeply in her throat. </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="501" height="17" font="0">  Yet there was light coming from somewhere else, white and muted. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="320" height="17" font="0">  The fluorescents, of course. In the kitchen. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  She paused on the thirteenth step, trying to remember if she had turned them </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  The mallet whistled through the air. She stepped backward, tripped over a </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="215" height="17" font="0">hassock, fell to the lobby rug. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="85" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Jack — &#34; </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  The mallet came down again with whistling, deadly velocity and buried itself </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">in her soft stomach. She screamed, suddenly submerged in an ocean of pain. Dimly </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">she saw the mallet rebound. It came to her with sudden numbing reality that he </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="462" height="17" font="0">meant to beat her to death with the mallet he held in his hands. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">  She tried to cry out to him again, to beg him to stop for Danny's sake, but </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">her breath had been knocked loose. She could only force out a weak whimper, </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="152" height="17" font="0">hardly a sound at all. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now. Now, by Christ,&#34; he said, grinning. He kicked the hassock out of his </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="328" height="17" font="0">way. &#34;I guess you'll take your medicine now.&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  The mallet whickered down. Wendy rolled to her left, her robe tangling above </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">her knees. Jack's hold on the mallet was jarred loose when it hit the floor. He </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">had to stoop and pick it up, and while he did she ran for the stairs, the breath </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">at last sobbing back into her. Her stomach was a bruise of throbbing pain. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Bitch,&#34; he said through his grin, and began to come after her. &#34;You stinking </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="455" height="17" font="0">bitch, I guess you'll get what's coming to you. I guess you will.&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  She heard the mallet whistle through the air and then agony exploded on her </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">right side as the mallet-head took her just below the line of her breasts, </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">breaking two ribs. She fell forward on the steps and new agony ripped her as she </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">struck on the wounded side. Yet instinct made her roll over, roll away, and the </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">mallet whizzed past the side of her face, missing by a naked inch. It struck the </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">deep pile of the stair carpeting with a muffled thud. That was when she saw the </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="539" height="17" font="0">knife, which had been jarred out of her hand by her fall. It lay glittering on </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="152" height="17" font="0">the fourth stair riser. </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Bitch,&#34; he repeated. The mallet came down. She shoved herself upward and it </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">landed just below her kneecap. Her lower leg was suddenly on fire. Blood began </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">to trickle down her calf. And then the mallet was coming down again. She jerked </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">her head away from it and it smashed into the stair riser in the hollow between </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="435" height="17" font="0">her neck and shoulder, scraping away the flesh from her ear. </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">  He brought the mallet down again and this time she rolled toward him, down the </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">stairs, inside the arc of his swing. A shriek escaped her as her broken ribs </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">thumped and grated. She struck his shins with her body while he was offbalance </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">and he fell backward with a yell of anger and surprise, his feet jigging to keep </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">their purchase on the stair riser. Then he thumped to the floor, the mallet </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">flying from his hand. He sat up, staring at her for a moment with shocked eyes. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="223" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll kill you for that,&#34; he said. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  He rolled over and stretched out for the handle of the mallet. Wendy forced </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">herself to her feet. Her left leg sent bolt after bolt of pain all the way up to </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">her hip. Her face was ashy pale but set. She leaped onto his back as his hand </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="299" height="17" font="0">closed over the shaft of the roque mallet. </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Oh dear God!&#34; she screamed to the Overlook's shadowy lobby, and buried the </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="354" height="17" font="0">kitchen knife in his lower back up to the handle. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  He stiffened beneath her and then shrieked. She thought she had never heard </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">such an awful sound in her whole life; it was as if the very boards and windows </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">and doors of the hotel had screamed. It seemed to go on and on while he remained </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">board-stiff beneath her weight. They were like a parlor charade of horse and </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">rider. Except that the back of his red-and-black-checked flannel shirt was </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="335" height="17" font="0">growing darker, sodden, with spreading blood. </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  Then he collapsed forward on his face, bucking her off on her hurt side, </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="132" height="17" font="0">making her groan. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  She lay breathing harshly for a time, unable to move. She was an excruciating </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">throb of pain from one end to the other. Every time she inhaled, something </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">stabbed viciously at her, and her neck was wet with blood from her grazed ear. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  There was only the sound of her struggle to breathe, the wind, and the ticking </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="162" height="17" font="0">clock in the ballroom. </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  At last she forced herself to her feet and hobbled across to the stairway. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">When she got there she clung to the newel post, head down, waves of faintness </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">washing over her. When it had passed a little, she began to climb, using her </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">unhurt leg and pulling with her arms on the banister. Once she looked up, </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="426" height="17" font="0">expecting to see Danny there, but the stairway was empty. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="412" height="17" font="0">  (Thank God he slept through it thank God thank God) </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  Six steps up she had to rest, her head down, her blond hair coiled on and over </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">the banister. Air whistled painfully through her throat, as if it had grown </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="328" height="17" font="0">barbs. Her right side was a swollen, hot mass. </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">  (Come on Wendy come on old girl get a locked door behind you and then look at </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">the damage thirteen more to go not so bad. And when you get to the upstairs </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  She drew in as much breath as her broken ribs would allow and half-pulled, </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="281" height="17" font="0">half-fell up another riser. And another. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  She was on the ninth, almost halfway up, when Jack's voice came from behind </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="431" height="17" font="0">and below her. He said thickly: &#34;You bitch. You killed me.&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  Terror as black as midnight swept through her. She looked over her shoulder </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="281" height="17" font="0">and saw Jack getting slowly to his feet. </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  His back was bowed over, and she could see the handle of the kitchen knife </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">sticking out of it. His eyes seemed to have contracted, almost to have lost </text>

<text top="171" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I'll give you your medicine,&#34; he whispered, and began to stagger toward the </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  Whimpering with fear, she began to pull herself upward again. Ten steps, a </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">her as an unattainable mountain peak. She was panting now, her side shrieking in </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">protest. Her hair swung wildly back and forth in front of her face. Sweat stung </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">her eyes. The ticking of the domed clock in the ballroom seemed to fill her </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">cars, and counterpointing it, Jack's panting, agonized gasps as he began to </text>

<text top="634" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">reluctant to do any more business that stormy day no matter how far Hallorann </text>
<text top="654" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">had come, and even more reluctant to rent one of his two snowmobiles out to this </text>
<text top="674" left="99" width="601" height="17" font="0">wild-eyed black man who insisted on going up to the old Overlook. Among people </text>
<text top="694" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">who had spent most of their lives in the little town of Sidewinder, the hotel </text>
<text top="714" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">had a smelly reputation. Murder had been done up there. A bunch of hoods had run </text>
<text top="734" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">the place for a while, and cutthroat businessmen had run it for a while, too. </text>
<text top="754" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">And things had been done up at the old Overlook that never made the papers, </text>
<text top="774" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">because money has a way of talking. But the people in Sidewinder had a pretty </text>
<text top="794" left="99" width="613" height="17" font="0">good idea. Most of the hotel's chambermaids came from here, and chambermaids see </text>

<text top="835" left="99" width="620" height="17" font="0">  But when Hallorann mentioned Howard Cottrell's name and showed Durkin the tag </text>
<text top="855" left="99" width="441" height="17" font="0">inside one of the blue mittens, the gas station owner thawed. </text>
<text top="875" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Sent you here, did he?&#34; Durkin asked, unlocking one of the garage bays and </text>
<text top="895" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">leading Hallorann inside. &#34;Good to know the old rip's got some sense left. I </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I don't know,&#34; Hallorann muttered. He felt sick with the time this was </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">taking. He was speaking with a country man, and he knew that all country men </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">feel a similar need to approach their business obliquely, to smell around its </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">time, because now he was one scared nigger and if this went on much longer he </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="239" height="17" font="0">just might decide to cut and run. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="486" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Look,&#34; he said. &#34;Please. I need to go up there and I have to have a </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="518" height="17" font="0">  &#34;All right,&#34; Durkin said, unperturbed. &#34;If Howard sent you, that's good </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann fumbled a twenty out of his wallet and handed it over. Durkin tucked </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Guess maybe we better trade jackets, too,&#34; Durkin said, pulling off his </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Don't fuss with me,&#34; Durkin interrupted, still mildly. &#34;I ain't sending you </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="602" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Lemme help you push that out,&#34; Durkin said. They rolled the snowmobile across </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">the oil-stained concrete and toward the garage bay. &#34;You ever drove one of these </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="500" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Well, there's nothing to it. The instructions are pasted there on the </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">dashboard, but all there really is, is stop and go. Your throttle's here, just </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">like a motorcycle throttle. Brake on the other side. Lean with it on the turns. </text>

<text top="1014" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  Now they were in the service station's snow-filled front lot, and Durkin had </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">raised his voice to make himself heard over the battering of the wind. &#34;Stay on </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">the road!&#34; he shouted at Hallorann's ear. &#34;Keep your eye on the guardrail posts </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann nodded and twisted the throttle slowly. The snowmobile purred </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">forward, the headlamp cutting a clean cone of light through the thickly falling </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">snow. He saw Durkin's upraised hand in the rearview mirror, and raised his own </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">in return. Then he nudged the handlebars to the left and was traveling up Main </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">Street, the snowmobile coursing smoothly through the white light thrown by the </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">streetlamps. The speedometer stood at thirty miles an hour. It was ten past </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">seven. At the Overlook, Wendy and Danny were sleeping and Jack Torrance was </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="461" height="17" font="0">discussing matters of life and death with the previous caretaker. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  Five blocks up Main, the streetlamps ended. For half a mile there were small </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="487" height="17" font="0">darkness.   In the black again with no light but the thin spear of the </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">snowmobile's headlamp, terror closed in on him again, a childlike fear, dismal </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">and disheartening. He had never felt so alone. For several minutes, as the few </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">lights of Sidewinder dwindled away and disappeared in the rearview, the urge to </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">turn around and go back was almost insurmountable. He reflected that for all of </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="374" height="17" font="0">  (That place has got a bad reputation around here.) </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  Clenching his teeth, he turned the throttle higher and watched the needle on </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">the speedometer climb past forty and settle at forty-five. He seemed to be going </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">horribly fast and yet he was afraid it wasn't fast enough. At this speed it </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">would take him almost an hour to get to the Overlook. But at a higher speed he </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="186" height="17" font="0">might not get there at all. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  He kept his eyes glued to the passing guardrails and the dime-sized reflectors </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="607" height="17" font="0">mounted on top of each one. Many of them were buried under drifts. Twice he saw </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">curve signs dangerously late and felt the snowmobile riding up the drifts that </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">masked the dropoff before turning back onto where the road was in the </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="619" height="17" font="0">summertime. The odometer counted off the miles at a maddeningly slow clip — five, </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">He had never really liked the Overlook, and there had been others who shared his </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  He could feel the voice that had almost wrecked him outside of Sidewinder </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">had been strong twenty-five miles back, how much stronger would it be now? He </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">couldn't keep it out entirely. Some of it was slipping through, flooding his </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">brain with sinister subliminal images. More and more he got the image of a badly </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">hurt woman in a bathroom, holding her hands up uselessly to ward off a blow, and </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="375" height="17" font="0">he felt more and more that the woman must be —  </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">  The embankment was looming up ahead of him like a freight train. Wool- </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">gathering, he had missed a turn sign. He jerked the snowmobile's steering gear </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">hard right and it swung around, tilting as it did so. From underneath came the </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">harsh grating sound of the snowtread on rock. He thought the snowmobile was </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">going to dump him, and it did totter on the knife-edge of balance before half- </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">driving, half-skidding back down to the more or less level surface of the snow- </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="595" height="17" font="0">buried road. Then the dropoff was ahead of him, the headlamp showing an abrupt </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">end to the snowcover and darkness beyond that. He turned the snowmobile the </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="332" height="17" font="0">other way, a pulse beating sickly in his throat. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="291" height="17" font="0">  (Keep it on the road Dicky old chum.) </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  He forced himself to turn the throttle up another notch. Now the speedometer </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">needle was pegged just below fifty. The wind howled and roared. The headlamp </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="124" height="17" font="0">probed the dark. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">  An unknown length of time later, he came around a driftbanked curve and saw a </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">glimmering flash of light ahead. Just a glimpse, and then it was blotted out by </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">a rising fold of land. The glimpse was so brief he was persuading himself it had </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">been wishful thinking when another turn brought it in view again, slightly </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">closer, for another few seconds. There was no question of its reality this time; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">he had seen it from just this angle too many times before. It was the Overlook. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="480" height="17" font="0">There were lights on the first floor and lobby levels, it looked like. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">  Some of his terror — the part that had to do with driving off the road or </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="641" height="17" font="0">wrecking the snowmobile on an unseen curve — melted entirely away. The snowmobile </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="507" height="17" font="0">swept surely into the first half of an S curve that he now remembered </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="535" height="17" font="0">confidently foot for foot, and that was when the headlamp picked out the </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="614" height="17" font="0">thought it was some hideously huge timberwolf that had been driven down from the </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">high country by the storm. Then, as he closed on it, he recognized it and horror </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="126" height="17" font="0">closed his throat. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="269" height="17" font="0">  Not a wolf but a lion. A hedge lion. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="610" height="17" font="0">  Its features were a mask of black shadow and powdered snow, its haunches wound </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">tight to spring. And it did spring, snow billowing around its pistoning rear </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="267" height="17" font="0">legs in a silent burst of crystal glitter. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann screamed and twisted the handlebars hard right, ducking low at the </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="600" height="17" font="0">his shoulders. The ski mask was torn open down the back. He was hurled from the </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="446" height="17" font="0">snowmobile. He hit the snow, plowed through it, rolled over. </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  He could feel it coming for him. In his nostrils there was a bitter smell of </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">green leaves and holly. A huge hedge paw batted him in the small of the back and </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="511" height="17" font="0">he flew ten feet through the air, splayed out like a rag doll. He saw the </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">snowmobile, riderless, strike the embankment and rear up, its headlamp searching </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="327" height="17" font="0">the sky. It fell over with a thump and stalled. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">  Then the hedge lion was on him. There was a crackling, rustling sound. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">Something raked across the front of the parka, shredding it. It might have been </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="322" height="17" font="0">stiff twigs, but Hallorann knew it was claws. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">  &#34;You're not there!&#34; Hallorann screamed at the circling, snarling hedge lion. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">&#34;You're not there at all!&#34; He struggled to his feet and made it halfway to the </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="366" height="17" font="0">tipped paw. Hallorann saw silent, exploding lights. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Not there,&#34; he said again, but it was a fading mutter. His knees unhinged and </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">and beneath her splayed fingers she could see that the carpet pattern appeared </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="294" height="17" font="0">to move, swaying and twining sinuously. </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">  The mallet slammed down behind her and she threw herself forward, sobbing. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">Over her shoulder she saw Jack stumble forward, overbalance, and bring the </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">clenching. Something inside her had snapped — she had heard it clearly, and for a </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">few moments she was aware only in a muted, muffled way, as if she were merely </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="429" height="17" font="0">observing these things through a cloudy wrapping of gauze. </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="436" height="17" font="0">  Then full consciousness came back, terror and pain with it. </text>

<text top="532" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">sidestroke motion. Jack was crawling after her, using the roque mallet as a </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">  She reached the comer and pulled herself around it, using her hands to yank at </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">possible, but it was. It was a hundred times worse not to be able to see him or </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">know how close he was getting. She tore out fistfuls of the carpet napping </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="530" height="17" font="0">pulling herself along, and she was halfway down this short hall before she </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="373" height="17" font="0">noticed the bedroom door was standing wide open. </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">She ignored the pain and halfwalked, half-shambled through the doorway as Jack </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">came around the far corner and began to lunge his way down toward the open door, </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="205" height="17" font="0">leaning on the roque mallet. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="537" height="17" font="0">  She caught the edge of the dresser, held herself up against it, and grabbed </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  Jack shouted at her: &#34;Don't you shut that door! Goddam you, don't you dare </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">every direction. Her hand seized the key ring just as the mallet whistled down </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">against the door, making it tremble in its frame. She got the key into the lock </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">on the second stab and twisted it to the right. At the sound of the tumblers </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="549" height="17" font="0">falling, Jack screamed. The mallet came down against the door in a volley of </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">booming blows that made her flinch and step back. How could he be doing that </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="547" height="17" font="0">with a knife in his back? Where was he finding the strength? She wanted to </text>

<text top="432" left="99" width="191" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny?&#34; she whispered. </text>

<text top="512" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  She fell clumsily to her knees, enduring another bolt of pain from her swollen </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">and bleeding leg, and looked under the bed. Nothing there but dustballs and </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="177" height="17" font="0">Jack's bedroom slippers. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  Jack screamed her name, and this time when he swung the mallet, a long </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">splinter of wood jumped from the door and clattered off the hardwood planking. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="572" height="17" font="0">The next blow brought a sickening, splintering crack, the sound of dry kindling </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">under a hatchet. The bloody mallet head, now splintered and gouged in its own </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="581" height="17" font="0">right, bashed through the new hole in the door, was withdrawn, and came down </text>

<text top="713" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">across the room to the closet. Her broken ribs stabbed at her, making her groan. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="81" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny?&#34; </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">  She brushed the hung garments aside frantically; some of them slipped their </text>

<text top="793" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">  She hobbled toward the bathroom and as she reached the door she glanced back </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">over her shoulder. The mallet crashed through again, widening the hole, and then </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">a hand appeared, groping for the bolt. She saw with horror that she had left </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="277" height="17" font="0">Jack's key ring dangling from the lock. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">  The hand yanked the bolt back, and as it did so it struck the bunched keys. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="429" height="17" font="0">They jingled merrily. The hand clutched them victoriously. </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">  With a sob, she pushed her way into the bathroom and slammed the door just as </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  Wendy ran the bolt and twisted the spring lock, looking around desperately. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">The bathroom was empty. Danny wasn't here, either. And as she caught sight of </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">her own bloodsmeared, horrified face in the medicine cabinet mirror, she was </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">glad. She had never believed that children should be witness to the little </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">quarrels of their parents. And perhaps the thing that was now raving through the </text>

<text top="211" left="99" width="520" height="17" font="0">Everything else was bolted down. God, was there nothing she could do? </text>

<text top="392" left="99" width="356" height="17" font="0">struck the walls indiscriminately with the mallet. </text>

<text top="613" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nowhere left to run, you cunt,&#34; it panted at her through its grin. The mallet </text>

<text top="855" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">slap to his left leg, making the knee sing with pain as it was driven in a way </text>
<text top="875" left="99" width="589" height="17" font="0">the joint had never been expected to bend. A groan escaped Hallorann's clenched </text>

<text top="915" left="99" width="455" height="17" font="0">  He fumbled for the second strap. Sticky blood ran in his eyes. </text>

<text top="492" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">locked and he dismounted after a wary look around, praying he hadn't lost his </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="585" height="17" font="0">found the right one and unsnapped the padlock, letting it drop into the snow. At </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">first he didn't think he was going to be able to move the gate anyway; he pawed </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">frantically at the snow surrounding it, disregarding the throbbing agony in his </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">He managed to pull it a foot and a half away from the gatepost, squeezed into </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">  He became aware of movement ahead of him in the dark. The hedge animals, all </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">of them, were clustered at the base of the Overlook's steps, guarding the way </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">in, the way out. The lions prowled. The dog stood with its front paws on the </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">around at the high, wasplike buzz of the approaching engine, and suddenly began </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">  Outside, the snowmobile rocketed along faster and faster. The hotel seemed to </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">surge toward it. Snow flew in Hallorann's face. The headlamp's oncoming glare </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="485" height="17" font="0">spotlighted the hedge shepherd's face, its blank and socketless eyes. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  Then it shrank away, leaving an opening. Hallorann yanked at the snowmobile's </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">steering gear with all his remaining strength, and it kicked around in a sharp </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">semicircle, throwing up clouds of snow, threatening to tip over. The rear end </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">struck the foot of the porch steps and rebounded. Hallorann was off in a flash </text>

<text top="412" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  The hotel's silence seemed to mock him with echoes which were almost there, </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">whistled down. The hood of the parka matted the blow, but not enough. A rocket </text>

<text top="934" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">out of his mouth. The side of his face was a puffed purple bruise. But he was </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">  The roar shook the whole facade of the hotel. Glass belched out onto the snow </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">and twinkled there like jagged diamonds. The hedge dog, which had been </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">approaching Danny and his mother, recoiled away from it, its green and shadow- </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">marbled ears flattening, its tail coming down between its legs as its haunches </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">flattened abjectly. In his head, Hallorann heard it whine fearfully, and mixed </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">with that sound was the fearful, confused yowling of the big cats. He struggled </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">to his feet to go to the other two and help them, and as he did so he saw </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">something more nightmarish than all the rest: the hedge rabbit, still coated </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">with snow, was battering itself crazily at the chainlink fence at the far end of </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">the playground, and the steel mesh was jingling with a kind of nightmare music, </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">like a spectral zither. Even from here he could hear the sounds of the close-set </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">twigs and branches which made up its body cracking and crunching like breaking </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="50" height="17" font="0">bones. </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Dick! Dick!&#34; Danny cried out. He was trying to support his mother, help her </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="592" height="17" font="0">over to the snowmobile. The clothes he had carried out for the two of them were </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">scattered between where they had fallen and where they now stood. Hallorann was </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">suddenly aware that the woman was in her nightclothes, Danny jacketless, and it </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="247" height="17" font="0">was no more than ten above zero. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="230" height="17" font="0">  (my gad she's in her bare feet) </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  He struggled back through the snow, picking up her coat, her boots, Danny's </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">coat, odd gloves. Then he ran back to them, plunging hip-deep in the snow from </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="326" height="17" font="0">time to time, having to flounder his way out. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  Wendy was horribly pale, the side of her neck coated with blood, blood that </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="133" height="17" font="0">was now freezing. </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="514" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I can't,&#34; she muttered. She was no more than semiconscious. &#34;No, I ... </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="94" height="17" font="0">can't. Sorry.&#34; </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="313" height="17" font="0">  Danny looked up at Hallorann pleadingly. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="500" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Gonna be okay,&#34; Hallorann said, and gripped her again. &#34;Come on.&#34; </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  The three of them made it to where the snowmobile had slewed around and </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">stalled out. Hallorann sat the woman down on the passenger seat and put her coat </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="593" height="17" font="0">on. He lifted her feet up — they were very cold but not frozen yet — and rubbed </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">them briskly with Danny's jacket before putting on her boots. Wendy's face was </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">alabaster pale, her eyes halflidded and dazed, but she had begun to shiver. </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="289" height="17" font="0">Hallorann thought that was a good sign. </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">  Behind them, a series of three explosions rocked the hotel. Orange flashes lit </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="74" height="17" font="0">the snow. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="524" height="17" font="0">  Danny put his mouth close to Hallorann's ear and screamed something. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="74" height="17" font="0">  &#34;What?&#34; </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="197" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I said do you need that?&#34; </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  The boy was pointing at the red gascan that leaned at an angle in the snow. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="127" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I guess we do.&#34; </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="555" height="17" font="0">  He picked it up and sloshed it. Still gas in there, he couldn't tell how much. </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">He attached the can to the back of the snowmobile, fumbling the job several </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="561" height="17" font="0">times before getting it right because his fingers were going numb. For the first </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="460" height="17" font="0">time he became aware that he'd lost Howard Cottrell's mittens. </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="264" height="17" font="0">  Danny shrank back. &#34;We'll freeze!&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="523" height="17" font="0">  &#34;We have to go around to the equipment shed! There's stuff in there ... </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  Danny got on, and Hallorann twisted his head so he could shout into Wendy's </text>

<text top="251" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  She put her arms around him and rested her cheek against his back. Hallorann </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">started the snowmobile and turned the throttle delicately so they would start up </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">without a jerk. The woman had the weakest sort of grip on him, and if she </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="504" height="17" font="0">shifted backward, her weight would tumble both her and the boy off. </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="606" height="17" font="0">  They began to move. He brought the snowmobile around in a circle and then they </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">were traveling west parallel to the hotel. Hallorann cut in more to circle </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="295" height="17" font="0">around behind it to the equipment shed. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  They had a momentarily clear view into the Overlook's lobby. The gasflame </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">coming up through the shattered floor was like a giant birthday candle, fierce </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">yellow at its heart and blue around its flickering edges. In that moment it </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">seemed only to be lighting, not destroying. They could see the registration desk </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="525" height="17" font="0">with its silver bell, the credit card decals, the old-fashioned, scrolled cash </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="506" height="17" font="0">register, the small figured throw rugs, the highbacked chairs, horsehair </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">hassocks. Danny could see the small sofa by the fireplace where the three nuns </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">had sat on the day they had come up — closing day. But this was the real closing </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="33" height="17" font="0">day. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="566" height="17" font="0">  Then the drift on the porch blotted the view out. A moment later they were </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">skirting the west side of the hotel. It was still light enough to see without </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="598" height="17" font="0">the snowmobile's headlight. Both upper stories were flaming now, and pennants of </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">flame shot out the windows. The gleaming white paint had begun to blacken and </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">peel. The shutters which had covered the Presidential Suite's picture window — </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="609" height="17" font="0">shutters Jack had carefully fastened as per instructions in mid-October — now hung </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">in flaming brands, exposing the wide and shattered darkness behind them, like a </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="375" height="17" font="0">toothless mouth yawing in a final, silent deathrattle. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">  Wendy had pressed her face against Hallorann's back to cut out the wind, and </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="545" height="17" font="0">Danny had likewise pressed his face against his mother's back, and so it was </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">only Hallorann who saw the final thing, and he never spoke of it. From the </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">window of the Presidential Suite he thought he saw a huge dark shape issue, </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="556" height="17" font="0">blotting out the snowfield behind it. For a moment it assumed the shape of a </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">huge, obscene manta, and then the wind seemed to catch it, to tear it and shred </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">it like old dark paper. It fragmented, was caught in a whirling eddy of smoke, </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">and a moment later it was gone as if it had never been. But in those few seconds </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="533" height="17" font="0">as it whirled blackly, dancing like negative motes of light, he remembered </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">something from his childhood ... fifty years ago, or more. He and his brother </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">had come upon a huge nest of ground wasps just north of their farm. It had been </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">tucked into a hollow between the earth and an old lightning-blasted tree. His </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">brother had had a big old niggerchaser in the band of his hat, saved all the way </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">from the Fourth of July. He had lighted it and tossed it at the nest. It had </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="599" height="17" font="0">exploded with a loud bang, and an angry, rising hum — almost a low shriek — had </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">risen from the blasted nest. They had run away as if demons had been at their </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">beels. In a way, Hallorann supposed that demons had been. And looking back over </text>

<text top="573" left="99" width="623" height="17" font="0">in the corner, by the roque set. He picked up four of them — they smelled musty and </text>

<text top="271" left="99" width="85" height="17" font="0">sound of it. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="331" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Dick!&#34; The boy was sobbing now, in terror. </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann drew the mallet from the rack and turned toward the flood of white </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">light from the snowmobile headlamp. His feet scratched unevenly over the boards </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="580" height="17" font="0">of the equipment shed, like the feet of a clockwork toy that has been wound up </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="134" height="17" font="0">and set in motion. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="578" height="17" font="0">  Suddenly he stopped, looked wonderingly at the mallet in his hands, and asked </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">himself with rising horror what it was he had been thinking of doing. Murder? </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="244" height="17" font="0">Had he been thinking of murder? </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  For a moment his entire mind seemed filled with an angry, weakly hectoring </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="46" height="17" font="0">voice: </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">  (Do it! Do it, you weak-kneed no-balls nigger! Kill them! KILL THEM BOTH!) </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">  Then he flung the mallet behind him with a whispered, terrified cry. It </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">clattered into the corner where the horseblankets had been, one of the two heads </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="358" height="17" font="0">pointed toward him in an unspeakable invitation. </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="71" height="17" font="0">  He fled. </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="615" height="17" font="0">  Danny was sitting on the snowmobile seat and Wendy was holding him weakly. His </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="532" height="17" font="0">face was shiny with tears, and he was shaking as if with ague. Between his </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="429" height="17" font="0">clicking teeth he said: &#34;Where were you? We were scared!&#34; </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="511" height="17" font="0">  &#34;It's a good place to be scared of,&#34; Hallorann said slowly. &#34;Even if that </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">place burns flat to the foundation, you'll never get me within a hundred miles </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">of here again. Here, Missus Torrance, wrap these around you. I'll help. You too, </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="309" height="17" font="0">Danny. Get yourself looking like an Arab.&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">  He swirled two of the blankets around Wendy, fashioning one of them into a </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="538" height="17" font="0">hood to cover her head, and helped Danny tie his so they wouldn't fall off. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Now hold on for dear life,&#34; he said. &#34;We got a long way to go, but the worst </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="136" height="17" font="0">is behind us now.&#34; </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="603" height="17" font="0">  He circled the equipment shed and then pointed the snowmobile back along their </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">trail. The Overlook was a torch now, flaming at the sky. Great holes had been </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="511" height="17" font="0">eaten into its sides, and there was a red hell inside, waxing and waning. </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="454" height="17" font="0">Snowmelt ran down the charred gutters in steaming waterfalls. </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  They purred down the front lawns their way well lit. The snowdunes glowed </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="54" height="17" font="0">scarlet. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Look!&#34; Danny shouted as Hallorann slowed for the front gate. He was pointing </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="172" height="17" font="0">toward the playground. </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="513" height="17" font="0">  The hedge creatures were all in their original positions, but they were </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">denuded, blackened, seared. Their dead branches were a stark interlacing network </text>
<text top="1014" left="99" width="510" height="17" font="0">in the fireglow, their small leaves scattered around their feet like fallen </text>
<text top="1035" left="99" width="50" height="17" font="0">petals. </text>
<text top="1055" left="99" width="407" height="17" font="0">  &#34;They're dead!&#34; Danny screamed in hysterical triumph. </text>

<text top="151" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Hey, doc,&#34; Hallorann said. &#34;Let's get to someplace warm. You ready?&#34; </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="424" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes,&#34; Danny whispered. &#34;I've been ready for so long — &#34; </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann edged through the gap between gate and post. A moment later they </text>
<text top="211" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">were on the road, pointed back toward Sidewinder. The sound of the snowmobile's </text>
<text top="231" left="99" width="543" height="17" font="0">engine dwindled until it was lost in the ceaseless roar of the wind. It rattled </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="584" height="17" font="0">through the denuded branches of the hedge animals with a low, beating, desolate </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="591" height="17" font="0">sound. The fire waxed and waned. Sometime after the sound of the snowmobile's </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">engine had disappeared, the Overlooks roof caved in — first the west wing, then </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">the east, and seconds later the central roof. A huge spiraling gout of sparks </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="433" height="17" font="0">and flaming debris rushed up into the howling winter night. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">  A bundle of flaming shingles and a wad of hot flashing were wafted through </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="321" height="17" font="0">the open equipment shed door by the wind. </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="315" height="17" font="0">  After a while the shed began to burn, too. </text>

<text top="472" left="99" width="586" height="17" font="0">  They were still twenty miles from Sidewinder when Hallorann stopped to pour </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="542" height="17" font="0">the rest of the gas into the snowmobile's tank. He was getting very worried </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="596" height="17" font="0">about Wendy Torrance, who seemed to be drifting away from them. It was still so </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="68" height="17" font="0">far to go. </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="553" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Dick!&#34; Danny cried. He was standing up on the seat, pointing. &#34;Dick, look! </text>

<text top="593" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">  The snow had stopped and a silver-dollar moon had peeked out through the </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">through a series of S-shaped switchbacks, was a pearly chain of lights. The wind </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="618" height="17" font="0">dropped for a moment and Hallorann heard the faraway buzzing snarl of snowmobile </text>

<text top="110" left="99" width="575" height="17" font="0">western Maine mountains, thirty miles from the town of Rangely. It was a good </text>
<text top="131" left="99" width="552" height="17" font="0">gig, Hallorann thought. The trade wasn't too heavy, it tipped well, and so far </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="522" height="17" font="0">there hadn't been a single meal sent back. Not bad at all, considering the </text>
<text top="171" left="99" width="201" height="17" font="0">season was nearly half over. </text>
<text top="191" left="99" width="594" height="17" font="0">  He threaded his way between the outdoor bar and the swimming pool (although </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">know), crossed a greensward where a party of four was playing croquet and </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="565" height="17" font="0">laughing, and crested a mild ridge. Pines took over here, and the wind soughed </text>
<text top="271" left="99" width="437" height="17" font="0">pleasantly in them, carrying the aroma of fir and sweet resin. </text>
<text top="291" left="99" width="541" height="17" font="0">  On the other side, a number of cabins with views of the lake were placed </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="534" height="17" font="0">discreetly among the trees. The last one was the nicest, and Hallorann had </text>
<text top="332" left="99" width="517" height="17" font="0">reserved it for a party of two back in April when he had gotten this gig. </text>
<text top="352" left="99" width="560" height="17" font="0">  The woman was sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, a book in her hands. </text>
<text top="372" left="99" width="515" height="17" font="0">Hallorann was struck again by the change in her. Part of it was the stiff, </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">almost formal way she sat, in spite of her informal surroundings — that was the </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">back brace, of course. She'd had a shattered vertebra as well as three broken </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">ribs and some internal injuries. The back was the slowest healing, and she was </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="546" height="17" font="0">still in the brace ... hence the formal posture. But the change was more than </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">that. She looked older, and some of the laughter had gone out of her face. Now, </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">as she sat reading her book, Hallorann saw a grave sort of beauty there that had </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="597" height="17" font="0">been missing on the day he had first met her, some nine months ago. Then she had </text>
<text top="532" left="99" width="604" height="17" font="0">still been mostly girl. Now she was a woman, a human being who had been dragged </text>
<text top="552" left="99" width="568" height="17" font="0">around to the dark side of the moon and had come back able to put the pieces </text>
<text top="573" left="99" width="573" height="17" font="0">back together. But those pieces, Hallorann thought, they never fit just the same </text>
<text top="593" left="99" width="227" height="17" font="0">way again. Never in this world. </text>
<text top="613" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">  She heard his step and looked up, closing her book. &#34;Dick! Hi!&#34; She started to </text>
<text top="633" left="99" width="350" height="17" font="0">rise, and a little grimace of pain crossed her face. </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="563" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nope, don't get up,&#34; he said. &#34;I don't stand on no ceremony unless it's white </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="551" height="17" font="0">  She smiled as he came up the steps and sat down next to her on the porch. </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="143" height="17" font="0">  &#34;How is it going?&#34; </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="567" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Pretty fair,&#34; he admitted. &#34;You try the shrimp creole tonight. You gonna like </text>

<text top="814" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Right down there.&#34; She pointed, and Hallorann saw a small figure sitting at </text>
<text top="834" left="99" width="540" height="17" font="0">the end of the dock. He was wearing jeans rolled up to the knee and a red- </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="559" height="17" font="0">striped shirt. Further out on the calm water, a bobber floated. Every now and </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">then Danny would reel it in, examine the sinker and hook below it, and then toss </text>

<text top="914" left="99" width="270" height="17" font="0">  &#34;He's gettin brown,&#34; Hallorann said. </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="342" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Yes. Very brown.&#34; She looked at him fondly. </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="548" height="17" font="0">  He took out a cigarette, tamped it, lit it. The smoke raftered away lazily in </text>
<text top="974" left="99" width="476" height="17" font="0">the sunny afternoon. &#34;What about those dreams he's been havin?&#34; </text>
<text top="994" left="99" width="506" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Better,&#34; Wendy said. &#34;Only one this week. It used to be every night, </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="570" height="17" font="0">I'd like to be working again before we dig too deeply into the insurance money </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="544" height="17" font="0">Jack left. There's still over forty thousand dollars. Enough to send Danny to </text>

<text top="633" left="99" width="569" height="17" font="0">  He walked down the sloping, graveled path that led to the dock and then out </text>
<text top="653" left="99" width="587" height="17" font="0">along the weather-beaten boards to the end, where Danny sat with his feet in the </text>
<text top="673" left="99" width="562" height="17" font="0">clear water. Beyond, the lake widened out, mirroring the pines along its verge. </text>
<text top="693" left="99" width="614" height="17" font="0">The terrain was mountainous around here, but the mountains were old, rounded and </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="357" height="17" font="0">humbled by time. Hallorann liked them just fine. </text>
<text top="733" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Catchin much?&#34; Hallorann said, sitting down next to him. He took off one </text>
<text top="753" left="99" width="564" height="17" font="0">shoe, then the other. With a sigh, he let his hot feet down into the cool water. </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="312" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No. But I had a nibble a little while ago.&#34; </text>

<text top="834" left="99" width="96" height="17" font="0">  &#34;How big?&#34; </text>
<text top="854" left="99" width="505" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann shrugged. &#34;Oh ... sharks, marlin, whales, that sort of thing.&#34; </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="202" height="17" font="0">  &#34;There aren't any whales!&#34; </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No blue whales, no. Of course not. These ones here run to no more than eighty </text>

<text top="954" left="99" width="590" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann put a hand on the boy's reddish-gold hair and rumpled it. &#34;They swim </text>

<text top="131" left="99" width="374" height="17" font="0">  Putting an arm around him, he said, &#34;What's this?&#34; </text>
<text top="151" left="99" width="224" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Nothing,&#34; Danny whispered. </text>

<text top="191" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  Danny nodded. &#34;You always know.&#34; One of the tears spilled from the corner of </text>

<text top="231" left="99" width="507" height="17" font="0">  &#34;We can't have any secrets,&#34; Hallorann agreed. &#34;That's just how it is.&#34; </text>
<text top="251" left="99" width="571" height="17" font="0">  Looking at his pole, Danny said: &#34;Sometimes I wish it had been me. It was my </text>

<text top="291" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">  Hallorann said, &#34;You don't like to talk about it around your mom, do you?&#34; </text>
<text top="311" left="99" width="441" height="17" font="0">  &#34;No. She wants to forget it ever happened. So do I, but — &#34; </text>

<text top="372" left="99" width="172" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Do you need to cry?&#34; </text>
<text top="392" left="99" width="582" height="17" font="0">  The boy tried to answer, but the words were swallowed in a sob. He leaned his </text>
<text top="412" left="99" width="554" height="17" font="0">head against Hallorann's shoulder and wept, the tears now flooding down his </text>
<text top="432" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">face. Hallorann held him and said nothing. The boy would have to shed his tears </text>
<text top="452" left="99" width="583" height="17" font="0">again and again, he knew, and it was Danny's luck that he was still young enough </text>
<text top="472" left="99" width="521" height="17" font="0">to be able to do that. The tears that heal are also the tears that scald and </text>
<text top="492" left="99" width="62" height="17" font="0">scourge. </text>
<text top="512" left="99" width="574" height="17" font="0">  When he had quieted a little, Hallorann said, &#34;You're gonna get over this. You </text>

<text top="552" left="99" width="528" height="17" font="0">  &#34;I wish I didn't!&#34; Danny choked, his voice still thick with tears. &#34;I wish I </text>

<text top="693" left="99" width="588" height="17" font="0">  They were quiet, watching Danny's bobber drift around thirty feet out from the </text>
<text top="713" left="99" width="558" height="17" font="0">end of the dock. Then Danny said, almost too low to be heard, &#34;You'll be my </text>

<text top="753" left="99" width="202" height="17" font="0">  &#34;As long as you want me.&#34; </text>
<text top="773" left="99" width="380" height="17" font="0">  The boy held him tight and Hallorann hugged him. </text>
<text top="793" left="99" width="536" height="17" font="0">  &#34;Danny? You listen to me. I'm going to talk to you about it this once and </text>
<text top="814" left="99" width="577" height="17" font="0">never again this same way. There's some things no six-year-old boy in the world </text>

<text top="854" left="99" width="529" height="17" font="0">hardly ever get together. The world's a hard place, Danny. It don't care. It </text>
<text top="874" left="99" width="550" height="17" font="0">don't hate you and me, but it don't love us, either. Terrible things happen in </text>
<text top="894" left="99" width="531" height="17" font="0">the world, and they're things no one can explain. Good people die in bad, </text>
<text top="914" left="99" width="557" height="17" font="0">painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems </text>
<text top="934" left="99" width="579" height="17" font="0">like it's only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don't love </text>
<text top="954" left="99" width="576" height="17" font="0">you, but your momma does and so do I. You're a good boy. You grieve for your </text>

<text top="994" left="99" width="526" height="17" font="0">a closet or under your covers and cry until it's all out of you again. That's </text>
