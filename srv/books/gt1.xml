<text top="206" left="206" width="665" height="22" font="2">e should start back,” Gared urged as the woods began to grow dark </text>
<text top="234" left="206" width="385" height="22" font="2">around them. “The wildlings are dead.” </text>
<text top="261" left="260" width="613" height="22" font="2">“Do the dead frighten you?” Ser Waymar Royce asked with </text>
<text top="289" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">just the hint of a smile. </text>
<text top="316" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen </text>
<text top="344" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the lordlings come and go. “Dead is dead,” he said. “We have no business with the </text>
<text top="372" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">dead.” </text>
<text top="399" left="108" width="601" height="22" font="2">“Are they dead?” Royce asked softly. “What proof have we?” </text>
<text top="427" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Will saw them,” Gared said. “If he says they are dead, that’s proof enough </text>
<text top="454" left="54" width="86" height="22" font="2">for me.” </text>
<text top="482" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He </text>
<text top="510" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wished it had been later rather than sooner. “My mother told me that dead men sing </text>
<text top="537" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">no songs,” he put in. </text>
<text top="565" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,” Royce replied. “Never believe </text>
<text top="592" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">anything you hear at a woman’s tit. There are things to be learned even from the </text>
<text top="620" left="54" width="514" height="22" font="2">dead.” His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest. </text>
<text top="648" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We have a long ride before us,” Gared pointed out. “Eight days, maybe nine. </text>
<text top="675" left="54" width="210" height="22" font="2">And night is falling.” </text>
<text top="703" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. “It does that every day </text>
<text top="730" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?” </text>
<text top="758" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Will could see the tightness around Gared’s mouth, the barely suppressed </text>
<text top="786" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty </text>
<text top="813" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">years in the Night’s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made </text>
<text top="841" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense </text>
<text top="868" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">something else in  the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came </text>
<text top="896" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">perilous close to fear. </text>
<text top="923" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he </text>
<text top="951" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had </text>
<text top="979" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred </text>
<text top="1006" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the </text>
<text top="1034" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">haunted forest had no more terrors for him. </text>
<text top="1061" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this </text>
<text top="1089" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and </text>
<text top="203" left="54" width="179" height="98" font="3">“W </text>

<page number="2" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of a band of wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="612" height="22" font="2">Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="408" height="22" font="2">Especially not a commander like this one. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">layers of black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the Night’s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. “Bet </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he killed them all himself, he did,” Gared told the barracks over wine, “twisted their </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="651" height="22" font="2">little heads off, our mighty warrior.” They had all shared the laugh. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="642" height="22" font="2">as he sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt the same. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,” Gared said. “They’re </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dead. They shan’t trouble us no more. There’s hard riding before us. I don’t like this </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">weather. If it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow’s the best we </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="464" height="22" font="2">can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, my lord?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">half-bored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. “Tell </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="636" height="22" font="2">me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night’s Watch. Well, a poacher in </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">truth. Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters’ own woods, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">skinning one of the Mallisters’ own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="633" height="22" font="2">and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,” Will </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">said. “I got close as I dared. There’s eight of them, men and women both. No </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">children I could see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow’s pretty well </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so </text>
</page>
<page number="3" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">still.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="254" height="22" font="2">“Did you see any blood?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="261" height="22" font="2">“Well, no,” Will admitted. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="283" height="22" font="2">“Did you see any weapons?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">“Some swords, a  few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-</text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="784" height="22" font="2">bladed, a cruel piece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="496" height="22" font="2">“Did you make note of the position of the bodies?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Will shrugged. “A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">ground. Fallen, like.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="319" height="22" font="2">“Or sleeping,” Royce suggested. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Fallen,” Will insisted. “There’s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">branches. A far-eyes.” He smiled thinly. “I took care she never saw me. When I got </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="730" height="22" font="2">closer, I saw that she wasn’t moving neither.” Despite himself, he shivered. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="330" height="22" font="2">“You have a chill?” Royce asked. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="436" height="22" font="2">“Some,” Will muttered. “The wind, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frostfallen leaves </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whispered past them, and Royce’s destrier moved restlessly. “What do you think </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">might have killed these men, Gared?” Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">drape of his long sable cloak. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“It was the cold,” Gared said with iron certainty. “I saw men freeze last </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">is the cold. It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don’t have the strength to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fight it. It’s easier just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don’t feel any pain </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">toward the end. First you go weak and drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">then it’s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Such eloquence, Gared,” Ser Waymar observed. “I never suspected you had </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">it in you.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I’ve had the cold in me too, lordling.” Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been. “Two ears, three </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="444" height="22" font="2">frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="622" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar shrugged. “You ought dress more warmly, Gared.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away. “We’ll see how warm you can </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dress when the winter comes.” He pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron, </text>
</page>
<page number="4" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="168" height="22" font="2">silent and sullen. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="446" height="22" font="2">“If Gared said it was the cold. . .” Will began. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="517" height="22" font="2">“Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yes, m’lord.” There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">watches. What was the man driving at? </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="338" height="22" font="2">“And how did you find the Wall?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Weeping,” Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">had pointed it out. “They couldn’t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">wasn’t cold enough.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Royce nodded. “Bright lad. We’ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hand, and the means of making fire.” The knight’s smile was cocksure. “Will, lead </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">us there. I would see these dead men for myself.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">honor bound them to obey. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the undergrowth. A light snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for the careless and the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="828" height="22" font="2">unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the lordling. Gared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">he rode. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Twilight deepened. The cloudless sky turned a deep purple, the color of an old </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bruise, then faded to black. The stars began to come out. A half-moon rose. Will </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">was grateful for the light. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We can make a better pace than this, surely,” Royce said when the moon was </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">full risen. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Not with this horse,” Will said. Fear had made him insolent. “Perhaps my </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="330" height="22" font="2">lord would care to take the lead?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="413" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar Royce did not deign to reply. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="422" height="22" font="2">Somewhere off in the wood a wolf howled. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">Will pulled his garron over beneath an ancient gnarled ironwood and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="124" height="22" font="2">dismounted. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="444" height="22" font="2">“Why are you stopping?” Ser Waymar asked. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="672" height="22" font="2">“Best go the rest of the way on foot, m’lord. It’s just over that ridge.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Royce paused a moment, staring off into the distance, his face reflective. A </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cold wind whispered through the trees. His great sable cloak stirred behind like </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="210" height="22" font="2">something half-alive. </text>
</page>
<page number="5" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="489" height="22" font="2">“There’s something wrong here,” Gared muttered. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="563" height="22" font="2">The young knight gave him a disdainful smile. “Is there?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="569" height="22" font="2">“Can’t you feel it?” Gared asked. “Listen to the darkness.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Will could feel it. Four years in the Night’s Watch, and he had never been so </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">afraid. What was it? </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Wind. Trees rustling. A wolf. Which sound is it that unmans you so, Gared?” </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">When Gared did not answer, Royce slid gracefully from his saddle. He tied the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">destrier securely to a low-hanging limb, well away from the other horses, and drew </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his longsword from its sheath. Jewels glittered in its hilt, and the moonlight ran </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down the shining steel. It was a splendid weapon, castle-forged, and new-made </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="637" height="22" font="2">from the look of it. Will doubted it had ever been swung in anger. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The trees press close here,” Will warned. “That sword will tangle you up, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">m’lord. Better a knife.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If I need instruction, I will ask for it,” the young lord said. “Gared, stay here. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">Guard the horses.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="485" height="22" font="2">Gared dismounted. “We need a fire. I’ll see to it.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“How big a fool are you, old man? If there are enemies in this wood, a fire is </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">the last thing we want.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“There’s some enemies a fire will keep away,” Gared said. “Bears and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">direwolves and. . . and other things. . .” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar’s mouth became a hard line. “No fire.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Gared’s hood shadowed his face, but Will could see the hard glitter in his eyes </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as he stared at the knight. For a moment he was afraid the older man would go for </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his sword. It was a short, ugly thing, its grip discolored by sweat, its edge nicked </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from hard use, but Will would not have given an iron bob for the lordling’s life if </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">Gared pulled it from its scabbard. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="712" height="22" font="2">Finally Gared looked down. “No fire,” he muttered, low under his breath. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="736" height="22" font="2">Royce took it for acquiescence and turned away. “Lead on,” he said to Will. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Will threaded their way through a thicket, then started up the slope to the low </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ridge where he had found his vantage point under a sentinel tree. Under the thin </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">crust of snow, the ground was damp and muddy, slick footing, with rocks and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hidden roots to trip you up. Will made no sound as he climbed. Behind him, he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">heard the soft metallic slither of the lordling’s ringmail, the rustle of leaves, and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">muttered curses as reaching branches grabbed at his longsword and tugged on his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">splendid sable cloak. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The great sentinel was right there at the top of the ridge, where Will had </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">known it would be, its lowest branches a bare foot off the ground. Will slid in </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">underneath, flat on his belly in the snow and the mud, and looked down on the </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His heart stopped in his chest. For a moment he dared not breathe. Moonlight </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shone down on the clearing, the ashes of the firepit, the snow-covered lean-to, the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">great rock, the little half-frozen stream. Everything was just as it had been a few </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="419" height="22" font="2">They were gone. All the bodies were gone. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Gods!” he heard behind him. A sword slashed at a branch as Ser Waymar </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Royce gained the ridge. He stood there beside the sentinel, longsword in hand, his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cloak billowing behind him as the wind came up, outlined  nobly against the stars </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="131" height="22" font="2">for all to see. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="595" height="22" font="2">“Get <i>down!</i>” Will whispered urgently. “Something’s wrong.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Royce did not move. He looked down at the empty clearing and laughed. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">“Your dead men seem to have moved camp, Will.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Will’s voice abandoned him. He groped for words that did not come. It was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not possible. His eyes swept back and forth over the abandoned campsite, stopped </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on the axe. A huge double-bladed battle-axe, still lying where he had seen it last, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">untouched. A valuable weapon. . .  </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“On your feet, Will,” Ser Waymar commanded. “There’s no one here. I won’t </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="306" height="22" font="2">have you hiding under a bush.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="253" height="22" font="2">Reluctantly, Will obeyed. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. “I am not going back to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Castle Black a failure on my first ranging. We  <i>will</i>  find these men.” He glanced </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="548" height="22" font="2">around. “Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a fire.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Will turned away, wordless. There was no use to argue. The wind was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">moving. It cut right through him. He went to the tree, a vaulting grey-green sentinel, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and began to climb. Soon his hands were sticky with sap, and he was lost among the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">needles. Fear filled his gut like a meal he could not digest. He whispered a prayer to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the nameless gods of the wood, and slipped his dirk free of its sheath. He put it </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">between his teeth to keep both hands free for climbing. The taste of cold iron in his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">mouth gave him comfort. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Down below, the lordling called out suddenly, “Who goes there?” Will heard </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="727" height="22" font="2">uncertainty in the challenge. He stopped climbing; he listened; he watched. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The woods gave answer: the rustle of  leaves, the icy rush of the stream, a </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">distant hoot of a snow owl. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="271" height="22" font="2">The Others made no sound. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Will saw movement from the corner of his eye. Pale shapes gliding through </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the wood. He turned his head, glimpsed a white shadow in the darkness. Then it </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">was gone. Branches stirred gently in the wind, scratching at one another with </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wooden fingers. Will opened his mouth to call down a warning, and the words </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seemed to freeze in his throat. Perhaps he was wrong. Perhaps it had only been a </text>

<page number="7" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bird, a reflection on the snow, some trick of the moonlight. What had he seen, after </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="41" height="22" font="2">all? </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Will, where are you?” Ser Waymar called up. “Can you see anything?” He </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was turning in a slow circle, suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">them, as Will felt them. There was nothing to see. “Answer me! Why is it so cold?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">It <i>was</i> cold. Shivering, Will clung more tightly to his perch. His face pressed </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hard against the trunk of the sentinel. He could feel the sweet, sticky sap on his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">cheek. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of Royce. Tall, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale as milk. Its armor seemed to </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">change color as it moved; here it was white as new-fallen snow, there black as </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadow, everywhere dappled with the deep grey-green of the trees. The patterns ran </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">like moonlight on water with every step it took. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Will heard the breath go out of Ser Waymar Royce in a long hiss. “Come no </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">farther,” the lordling warned. His voice cracked like a boy’s. He threw the long </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sable cloak back over his shoulders, to free his arms for battle, and took his sword </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">in both hands. The wind had stopped. It was very cold. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Other slid forward on silent feet. In its hand was a longsword like none </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">that Will had ever seen. No human metal had gone into the forging of that blade. It </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was alive with moonlight, translucent, a shard of crystal so thin that it seemed </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">almost to vanish when seen edge-on. There was a faint blue shimmer to the thing, a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ghost-light that played around its edges, and somehow Will knew it was sharper </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">than any razor. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar met him bravely. “Dance with me then.” He lifted his sword high </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">over his head, defiant. His hands trembled from the weight of it, or perhaps from </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the cold. Yet in that moment, Will thought, he was a boy no longer, but a man of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="188" height="22" font="2">the Night’s Watch. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Other halted. Will saw its eyes; blue, deeper and bluer than any human </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eyes, a blue that burned like ice. They fixed on the longsword trembling on high, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">watched the moonlight running cold along the metal. For a heartbeat he dared  to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">hope. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">They emerged silently from the shadows, twins to the first. Three of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them. . . four. . . five. . . Ser Waymar may have felt the cold that came with them, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but he never saw them, never heard them. Will had to call out. It was his duty. And </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">his death, if he did. He shivered, and hugged the tree, and kept the silence. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="459" height="22" font="2">The pale sword came shivering through the air. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar met it with steel. When the blades met, there was no ring of </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">metal on metal; only a high, thin sound at the edge of hearing, like an animal </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">screaming in pain. Royce checked a second blow, and a third, then fell back a step. </text>
</page>
<page number="8" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">Another flurry of blows, and he fell back again. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Behind him, to right, to left, all around him, the watchers stood patient, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">faceless, silent, the shifting patterns of  their delicate armor making them all but </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">invisible in the wood. Yet they made no move to interfere. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Again and again the swords met, until Will wanted to cover his ears against </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the strange anguished keening of their clash. Ser Waymar was panting from the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">effort now, his breath steaming in the moonlight. His blade was white with frost; </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">the Other’s danced with pale blue light. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Then Royce’s parry came a beat too late. The pale sword bit through the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ringmail beneath his arm. The young lord cried out in pain. Blood welled between </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the rings. It steamed in the cold, and the droplets seemed red as fire where they </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">touched the snow. Ser Waymar’s fingers brushed his side. His moleskin glove came </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">away soaked with red. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Other said something in a language that Will did not know; his voice was </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="681" height="22" font="2">like the cracking of ice on a winter lake, and the words were mocking. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Waymar Royce found his fury. “For Robert!” he shouted, and he came up </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">snarling, lifting the frost-covered longsword with both hands and swinging it </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">around in a flat sidearm slash with all his weight behind it. The Other’s parry was </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="122" height="22" font="2">almost lazy. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="438" height="22" font="2">When the blades touched, the steel shattered. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A scream echoed through the forest night, and the longsword shivered into a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hundred brittle pieces, the shards scattering like a rain of needles. Royce went to his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled between his fingers. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Swords rose and fell, all in a deathly silence. It was cold butchery. The pale blades </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sliced through ringmail as if it were silk. Will closed his eyes. Far beneath him, he </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="459" height="22" font="2">heard their voices and laughter sharp as icicles. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When he found the courage to look again, a long time had passed, and the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">ridge below was empty. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He stayed in the tree, scarce daring to breathe, while the moon crept slowly </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">across the black sky. Finally, his muscles cramping and his fingers numb with cold, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="177" height="22" font="2">he climbed down. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Royce’s body lay facedown in the snow, one arm outflung. The thick sable </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cloak had been slashed in a dozen places. Lying dead like that, you saw how young </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">he was. A boy. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He found what was left of the sword a few feet away, the end splintered and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">twisted like a tree struck by lightning. Will knelt, looked around warily, and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">snatched it up. The broken sword would be his proof. Gared would know what to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">make of it, and if not him, then surely that old bear Mormont or Maester Aemon. </text>

<page number="9" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="610" height="22" font="2">Would Gared still be waiting with the horses? He had to hurry. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="451" height="22" font="2">Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his sword </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to pray. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his throat. They were </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood, yet the touch was icy cold. </text>

<text top="262" left="122" width="751" height="22" font="2">he morning had dawned clear and cold, with a crispness that hinted at the </text>
<text top="290" left="122" width="748" height="22" font="2">end of summer. They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded, twenty in </text>
<text top="318" left="122" width="749" height="22" font="2">all, and Bran rode among them, nervous with excitement. This was the first </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">see the king’s justice done. It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="114" height="22" font="2">Bran’s life. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">made Bran’s skin prickle to think of  it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">Night to sire terrible half-human children. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">king’s justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb. He had lost both </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed all in black, the same as a brother of </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">the Night’s Watch, except that his furs were ragged and greasy. </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The breath of man and horse mingled, steaming, in the cold morning air as his </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lord father had the man cut down from the wall and dragged before them. Robb and </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jon sat tall and still on their horses, with Bran between them on his pony, trying to </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seem older than seven, trying to pretend that he’d seen all this before. A faint wind </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blew through the holdfast gate. Over their heads flapped the banner of the Starks of </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">Winterfell: a grey direwolf racing across an ice-white field. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran’s father sat solemnly on his horse, long brown hair stirring in the wind. </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">His closely trimmed beard was shot with white, making him look older than his </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thirty-five years. He had a grim cast to his grey eyes this day, and he seemed not at </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all the man who would sit before the fire in the evening and talk softly of the age of </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">heroes and the children of the forest. He had taken off Father’s face, Bran thought, </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="471" height="22" font="2">and donned the face of Lord Stark of Winterfell. </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There were questions asked and answers given there in the chill of morning, </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but afterward Bran could not recall much of what had been said. Finally his lord </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">father gave a command, and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ironwood stump in the center of the square. They forced his head down onto the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">hard black wood. Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brought forth the sword. “Ice,” that sword was called. It was as wide across as a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">man’s hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His father peeled off his gloves and handed them to Jory Cassel, the captain of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his household guard. He took hold of Ice with both hands and said, “In the name of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of the North, I do sentence you to die.” He lifted the greatsword high above his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">head. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran’s bastard brother Jon Snow moved closer. “Keep the pony well in hand,” </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">he whispered. “And don’t look away. Father will know if you do.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="544" height="22" font="2">Bran kept his pony well in hand, and did not look away. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His father took off the man’s head with a single sure stroke. Blood sprayed </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">out across the snow, as red as surnmerwine. One of the horses reared and had to be </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">restrained to keep from bolting.  Bran could not take his eyes off the blood. The </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="650" height="22" font="2">snows around the stump drank it eagerly, reddening as he watched. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The head bounced off a thick root and rolled. It came up near Greyjoy’s feet. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Theon was a lean, dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing. He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="523" height="22" font="2">laughed, put his boot on the head, and kicked it away. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ass,” Jon muttered, low enough so Greyjoy did not hear. He put a hand on </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Bran’s shoulder, and Bran looked over at his bastard brother. “You did well,” Jon </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="577" height="22" font="2">told him solemnly. Jon was fourteen, an old hand at justice. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell, though the wind had died </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">by then and the sun was higher in the sky. Bran rode with his brothers, well ahead </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">of the main party, his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The deserter died bravely,” Robb said. He was big and broad and growing </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">every day, with his mother’s coloring, the fair skin, red-brown hair, and blue eyes </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">of the Tullys of Riverrun. “He had courage, at the least.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No,” Jon Snow said quietly. “It was not courage. This one was dead of fear. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">You could see it in his eyes, Stark.” Jon’s eyes were a grey so dark they seemed </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">almost black, but there was little they did not see. He was of an age with Robb, but </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">they did not look alike. Jon was slender where  Robb was muscular, dark where </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="745" height="22" font="2">Robb was fair, graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb was not impressed. “The Others take his eyes,” he swore. “He died well. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">Race you to the bridge?” </text>
</page>
<page number="12" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Done,” Jon said, kicking his horse forward. Robb cursed and followed, and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they galloped off down the trail, Robb laughing and hooting, Jon silent and intent. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">The hooves of their horses kicked up showers of snow as they went. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Bran did not try to follow. His pony could not keep up. He had seen the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ragged man’s eyes, and he was thinking of them now. After a while, the sound of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">Robb’s laughter receded, and the woods grew silent again. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">father moved up to ride beside him. “Are you well, Bran?” he asked, not unkindly. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yes, Father,” Bran told him. He looked up. Wrapped in his furs and leathers, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mounted on his great warhorse, his lord father loomed over him like a giant. “Robb </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">says the man died bravely, but Jon says he was afraid.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="380" height="22" font="2">“What do you think?” his father asked. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="616" height="22" font="2">Bran thought about it. “Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That is the only time a man can be brave,” his father told him. “Do you </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">understand why I did it?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He was a wildling,” Bran said. “They carry off women and sell them to the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">Others.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His lord father smiled. “Old Nan has been telling you stories again. In truth, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the man was an oathbreaker, a deserter from the Night’s Watch. No man is more </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dangerous. The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">from any crime, no matter how vile. But you mistake me. The question was not why </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="406" height="22" font="2">the man had to die, but why <i>I</i> must do it.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Bran had no answer for that. “King Robert has a headsman,” he said, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="120" height="22" font="2">uncertainly. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He does,” his father admitted. “As did the Targaryen kings before him. Yet </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">our way is the older way. The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Starks, and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the sword. If you would take a man’s life, you owe it to him to look into his eyes </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and hear his final words. And if you cannot bear to do that, then perhaps the man </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="232" height="22" font="2">does not deserve to die. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“One day, Bran, you will be Robb’s bannerman, holding a keep of your own </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">for your brother and your king, and justice will fall to you. When that day comes, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you must take no pleasure in the task, but neither must you look away. A ruler who </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them. He waved </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and shouted down at them. “<i>Father, Bran, come quickly, see what Robb has found!</i>” </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">Then he was gone again. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="455" height="22" font="2">Jory rode up beside them. “Trouble, my lord?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Beyond a doubt,” his lord father said. “Come, let us see what mischief my </text>
</page>
<page number="13" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sons have rooted out now.” He sent his horse into a trot. Jory and Bran and the rest </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">came after. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They found Robb on the riverbank north of the bridge, with Jon still mounted </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">beside him. The late summer snows had been heavy this moonturn. Robb stood </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">knee-deep in white, his hood pulled back so the sun shone in his hair. He was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="763" height="22" font="2">cradling something in his arm, while the boys talked in hushed, excited voices. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The riders picked their way carefully through the drifts, groping for solid </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">footing on the hidden, uneven ground. Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to reach the boys. Greyjoy was laughing and joking as he rode. Bran heard the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">breath go out of him. “Gods!” he exclaimed, struggling to keep control of his horse </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">as he reached for his sword. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jory’s sword was already out. “Robb, get away from it!” he called as his horse </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="176" height="22" font="2">reared under him. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robb grinned and looked up from the bundle in his arms. “She can’t hurt </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">you,” he said. “She’s dead, Jory.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran was afire with curiosity by then. He would have spurred the pony faster, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but his father made them dismount beside the bridge and approach on foot. Bran </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">jumped off and ran. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By then Jon, Jory, and Theon Greyjoy had all dismounted as well. “What in </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">the seven hells is it?” Greyjoy was saying. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="251" height="22" font="2">“A wolf,” Robb told him. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">“A freak,” Greyjoy said. “Look at the <i>size</i> of it.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran’s heart was thumping in his chest as he pushed through a waist-high drift </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="202" height="22" font="2">to his brothers’ side. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Half-buried in bloodstained snow, a huge dark shape slumped in death. Ice </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had formed in its shaggy grey fur, and the faint smell of corruption clung to it like a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">woman’s perfume. Bran glimpsed blind eyes crawling with maggots, a wide mouth </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">full of yellowed teeth. But it was the size of it that made him gasp. It was bigger </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">than his pony, twice the size of the largest hound in his father’s kennel. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It’s no freak,” Jon said calmly. “That’s a direwolf. They grow larger than the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">other kind.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy said, “There’s not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="200" height="22" font="2">two hundred years.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="284" height="22" font="2">“I see one now,” Jon replied. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Bran tore his eyes away from the monster. That was when he noticed the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bundle in Robb’s arms. He gave a cry of delight and moved closer. The pup was a </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tiny ball of grey-black fur, its eyes still closed. It nuzzled blindly against Robb’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">chest as he cradled it, searching for milk among his leathers, making a sad little </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whimpery sound. Bran reached out hesitantly. “Go on,” Robb told him. “You can </text>
</page>
<page number="14" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">touch him.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran gave the pup a quick nervous stroke, then turned as Jon said, “Here you </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">go.” His half brother put a second pup into his arms. “There are five of them.” Bran </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sat down in the snow and hugged the wolf pup to his face. Its fur was soft and warm </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="176" height="22" font="2">against his cheek. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Direwolves loose in the realm, after so many years,” muttered Hullen, the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="299" height="22" font="2">master of horse. “I like it not.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="231" height="22" font="2">“It is a sign,” Jory said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Father frowned. “This is only a dead animal, Jory,” he said. Yet he seemed </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">troubled. Snow crunched under his boots as he moved around the body. “Do we </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">know what killed her?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“There’s something in the throat,” Robb told him, proud to have found the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="628" height="22" font="2">answer before his father even asked. “There, just under the jaw.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His father knelt and groped under the beast’s head with his hand. He gave a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">yank and held it up for all to see. A foot of shattered antler, tines snapped off, all </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">wet with blood. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A sudden silence descended over the party. The men looked at the antler </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">uneasily, and no one dared to speak. Even Bran could sense their fear, though he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">did not understand. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His father tossed the antler to the side and cleansed his hands in the snow. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">“I’m surprised she lived long enough to whelp,” he said. His voice broke the spell. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Maybe she didn’t,” Jory said. “I’ve heard tales. . . maybe the bitch was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="346" height="22" font="2">already dead when the pups came.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="552" height="22" font="2">“Born with the dead,” another man put in. “Worse luck.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="579" height="22" font="2">“No matter,” said Hullen. “They be dead soon enough too.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="356" height="22" font="2">Bran gave a wordless cry of dismay. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The sooner the better,” Theon Greyjoy agreed. He drew his sword. “Give the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="178" height="22" font="2">beast here, Bran.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The little thing squirmed against him, as if it heard and understood. “<i>No!</i>” </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">Bran cried out fiercely. “It’s mine.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Put away your sword, Greyjoy,” Robb said. For a moment he sounded as </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">commanding as their father, like the lord he would someday be. “We will keep </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="123" height="22" font="2">these pups.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="618" height="22" font="2">“You cannot do that, boy,” said Harwin, who was Hullen’s son. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="398" height="22" font="2">“It be a mercy to kill them,” Hullen said. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran looked to his lord father for rescue, but got only a frown, a furrowed </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brow. “Hullen speaks truly, son. Better a swift death than a hard one from cold and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">starvation.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” He could feel tears welling in his eyes, and he looked away. He did not </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb resisted stubbornly. “Ser Rodrik’s red bitch whelped again last week,” </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">he said. “It was a small litter, only two live pups. She’ll have milk enough.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="452" height="22" font="2">“She’ll rip them apart when they try to nurse.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Lord Stark,” Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Bran looked at him with desperate hope. “There are five pups,” he told Father. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">“Three male, two female.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="181" height="22" font="2">“What of it, Jon?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You have five trueborn children,” Jon said. “Three sons, two daughters. The </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">my lord.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran saw his father’s face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Their father understood as well. “You want no pup for yourself, Jon?” he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">asked softly. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark,” Jon pointed out. “I am no </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">Stark, Father.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">left. “I will nurse him myself, Father,” he promised. “I will soak a towel with warm </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="349" height="22" font="2">milk, and give him suck from that.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="237" height="22" font="2">“Me too!” Bran echoed. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. “Easy to say, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants’ time with this. If you want </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="138" height="22" font="2">warm tongue. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You must train them as well,” their father said. “You must train them. The </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a man’s arm </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="751" height="22" font="2">off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="247" height="22" font="2">“Yes, Father,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="205" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Robb agreed. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="467" height="22" font="2">“The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="537" height="22" font="2">“They won’t die,” Robb said. “We won’t <i>let</i> them die.” </text>
</page>
<page number="16" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. It’s time we were </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">back to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="497" height="22" font="2">Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="400" height="22" font="2">“What is it, Jon?” their lord father asked. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="200" height="22" font="2">“Can’t you hear it?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">something else. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“There,” Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="705" height="22" font="2">watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="546" height="22" font="2">“He must have crawled away from the others,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Or been driven away,” their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="591" height="22" font="2">would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“An albino,” Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. “This one will die </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="275" height="22" font="2">even faster than the others.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow gave his father’s ward a long, chilling look. “I think not, Greyjoy,” </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="337" height="22" font="2">he said. “This one belongs to me.” </text>

<text top="290" left="180" width="694" height="22" font="2">She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red </text>
<text top="318" left="126" width="749" height="22" font="2">Fork of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="640" height="22" font="2">from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place of deep silence and </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="607" height="22" font="2">brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="611" height="22" font="2">man’s life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">light that filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="504" height="22" font="2">they shared with the vanished children of the forest. </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">where the waters were black and cold. “The heart tree,” Ned called it. The </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">castle’s granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the forest had </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">First Men across the narrow sea. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Up here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">follow her as she came. “Ned,” she called softly. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He lifted his head to look at her. “Catelyn,” he said. His voice was distant and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="333" height="22" font="2">formal. “Where are the children?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He would always ask her that. “In the kitchen, arguing about names for the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wolf pups.” She spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">ignore them. “Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">Rickon is not quite sure.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="259" height="22" font="2">“Is he afraid?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="421" height="22" font="2">“A little,” she admitted. “He is only three.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned. “He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">And winter is coming.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The </text>

<text top="860" left="54" width="701" height="22" font="2">first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The man died well, I’ll give him that,” Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leather in one hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">metal to a dark glow. “I was glad for Bran’s sake. You would have been proud of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">Bran.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I am always proud of Bran,” Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stroked it. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had </text>

<page number="19" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and as sharp as the day it was forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He was the fourth this year,” Ned said grimly. “The poor man was half-mad. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him.” He </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">sighed. “Ben writes that the strength of the Night’s Watch is down below a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">thousand. It’s not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="310" height="22" font="2">“Is it the wildlings?” she asked. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Who else?” Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. “And it </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">will only grow worse. The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="2">banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="550" height="22" font="2">“Beyond the Wall?” The thought made Catelyn shudder. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="707" height="22" font="2">Ned saw the dread on her face. “Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“There are darker things beyond the Wall.” She glanced behind her at the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">thoughts. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">His smile  was gentle. “You listen to too many of Old Nan’s stories. The </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="746" height="22" font="2">Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either,” Catelyn </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">reminded him. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully,” he said with a rueful </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smile. He slid Ice back into its sheath. “You did not come here to tell me crib tales. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="568" height="22" font="2">I know how little you like this place. What is it, my lady?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn took her husband’s hand. “There was grievous news today, my lord. I </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself.” There was no way to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">soften the blow, so she told him straight. “I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">dead.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">had pledged to protect. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="312" height="22" font="2">daughters of Lord Hoster Tully. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="392" height="22" font="2">“Jon. . .” he said. “Is this news certain?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It was the king’s seal, and the letter is in Robert’s own hand. I saved it for </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That is some small mercy, I suppose,” he said. She could see the grief on his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">face, but even then he thought first of her. “Your sister,” he said. “And Jon’s boy. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">What word of them?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie,” </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Catelyn said. “I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lonely, and it was ever her husband’s place, not hers. Lord Jon’s memory will haunt </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends around </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">her.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">Gate, I’d heard.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn nodded. “Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="286" height="22" font="2">is some comfort, but still. . .” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Go to her,” Ned urged. “Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shouts and laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">should not be alone in her grief.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Would that I could,” Catelyn said. “The letter had other tidings. The king is </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="361" height="22" font="2">riding to Winterfell to seek you out.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">came, the darkness left his eyes. “Robert is coming here?” When she nodded, a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">smile broke across his face. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">put no faith in signs. “I knew that would please you,” she said. “We should send </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="340" height="22" font="2">word to your brother on the Wall.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Yes, of course,” he agreed. “Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Luwin to send his swiftest bird.” Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. “Damnation, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">how many years has it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">in his party, did the message say?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes,” he said. “It is just as well. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">That will give us more time to prepare.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="562" height="22" font="2">“The queen’s brothers are also in the party,” she told him. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queen’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">family, Catelyn knew. The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert’s </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. “Well, if </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the price for Robert’s company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It sounds as </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">though Robert is bringing half his court.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“Where the king goes, the realm follows,” she said. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">Lannister woman’s teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Prince Tommen is seven,” she told him. “The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">guard your tongue. The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">with every passing year.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned squeezed her hand. “There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Robert will want to hunt. I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, how are we going to feed them all? </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.” </text>

<text top="262" left="135" width="738" height="22" font="2">er brother held the gown up for her inspection. “This is beauty. Touch it. </text>
<text top="290" left="135" width="255" height="22" font="2">Go on. Caress the fabric.” </text>
<text top="318" left="189" width="687" height="22" font="2">Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">through her fingers like water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. “Is it really mine?” </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A gift from the Magister Illyrio,” Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">high mood tonight. “The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">look like a princess.” </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>A princess</i>, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had never really known. “Why does he give us so much?” she asked. “What does he </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">want from us?” For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magister’s house, </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Illyrio is no fool,” Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. “The magister knows that I will not </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">forget my friends when I come into my throne.” </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Jade Sea.  It was also said that he’d never had a friend he wouldn’t cheerfully </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dream. His anger  was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it “waking the </text>

<text top="952" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her brother hung the gown beside the door. “Illyrio will send the slaves to </text>

<text top="1007" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount.” He studied her critically. </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">“You still slouch. Straighten yourself” He pushed back her shoulders with his </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hands. “Let them see that you have a woman’s shape now.” His fingers brushed </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. “You will not fail me </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">you?” His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="291" height="22" font="2">tunic. “<i>Do you?</i>” he repeated. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="248" height="22" font="2">“No,” Dany said meekly. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Her brother smiled. “Good.” He touched her hair, almost with affection. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">tonight.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="299" height="22" font="2">attend at Khal Drogo’s manse. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land  <i>Rhaesh Andahli</i>, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the land of the  Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Kingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. “Our land,” he called it. The words </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="601" height="22" font="2">do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">eight when they fled King’s Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="641" height="22" font="2">but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mother’s womb. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shimmering on the ship’s black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">King’s Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurper’s dogs, the lords Lannister </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegar’s heir was ripped </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="540" height="22" font="2">Kingslayer opened Father’s throat with a golden sword. </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">Viserys had never forgiven her. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Usurper’s brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her “Little Princess” and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sometimes “My Lady,” and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">closed behind them forever. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and on to Qohor and Volantis and  Lys,  never staying long in any one place. Her </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brother would not allow it. The Usurper’s hired knives were close behind them, he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="411" height="22" font="2">insisted, though Dany had never seen one. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">even the coin they had gotten from Mother’s crown had gone. In the alleys and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother “the beggar king.” Dany did not want </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="290" height="22" font="2">to know what they called her. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“We will have it all back someday, sweet sister,” he would promise her. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. “The jewels and the silks, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dragonstone and King’s Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms,  all </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they have taken from us, we will have it back.” Viserys lived for that day. All that </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="479" height="22" font="2">her window, the childhood she had never known. </text>
</page>
<page number="25" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">There came a soft knock on her door. “Come,” Dany said, turning away from </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the window. Illyrio’s servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were slaves, a gift from one of the magister’s many Dothraki friends. There was no </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Illyrio’s favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">as she worked. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Dany’s head and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. “Ours is the house of the dragon,” </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">he would say. “The fire is in our blood.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">she was. “Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thousand men ride in his <i>khalasar</i>, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rooms and doors of solid silver.” There was more like that, so much more, what a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">handsome man the <i>khal</i> was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to mount a horse, a demon archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that she would wed Viserys when she came of age. For centuries the Targaryens </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">barbarian. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dry. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. Last of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Now you look all a princess,” the girl said breathlessly when they were done. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thoughtfully provided.  <i>A princess</i>,  she thought, but she remembered what the girl </text>
</page>
<page number="26" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="522" height="22" font="2">a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="753" height="22" font="2">critically. “Stand there,” he told her. “Turn around. Yes. Good. You look . . .” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Regal,” Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">surprising delicacy for such a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-</text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. “May the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Daenerys,” the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. “She is a vision, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="688" height="22" font="2">Your Grace, a vision,” he told her brother. “Drogo will be enraptured.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“She’s too skinny,” Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, “Are you sure that </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="410" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo likes his women this young?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“She has had her blood. She is old enough for the <i>khal</i>,” Illyrio told him, not </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">for the first time. “Look at her. That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes. . . she is the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt. . . and highborn, daughter of the old king, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.” When he released her </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">hand, Daenerys found herself trembling. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I suppose,” her brother said doubtfully. “The savages have queer tastes. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">Boys, horses, sheep. . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="493" height="22" font="2">“Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo,” Illyrio said. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="683" height="22" font="2">Anger flashed in her brother’s lilac eyes. “Do you take me for a fool?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The magister bowed slightly. “I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">common men. My apologies if I have given offense.” He turned away and clapped </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">his hands for his bearers. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrio’s elaborately </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">carved palanquin. Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. Dany could smell </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="604" height="22" font="2">the stench of Illyrio’s pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was away across the narrow sea. “We won’t need his whole  <i>khalasar</i>,” Viserys </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said. His fingers  toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had never used a sword in earnest. “Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could </text>
</page>
<page number="27" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king.” He looked at Illyrio </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="333" height="22" font="2">anxiously. “They do, don’t they?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“They are your people, and they love you well,” Magister Illyrio said amiably. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="588" height="22" font="2">water.” He gave a massive shrug. “Or so my agents tell me.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrio’s sweet words as she mistrusted </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding eagerly, however. “I shall kill the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Usurper myself,” he promised, who had never killed anyone, “as he killed my </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="798" height="22" font="2">brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what he did to my father.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“That would be most fitting,” Magister Illyrio said. Dany saw the smallest hint </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of a smile playing around his full lips, but her brother did not notice. Nodding, he </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pushed back a curtain and stared off into the night, and Dany knew he was fighting </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">the Battle of the Trident once again. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The nine-towered manse of Khal Drogo sat  beside the waters of the bay, its </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">high brick walls overgrown with pale ivy. It had been given to the  <i>khal</i>  by the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">magisters of Pentos, Illyrio told them. The Free Cities were always generous with </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the horselords. “It is not that we fear these barbarians,” Illyrio would explain with a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smile. “The Lord of Light would hold our city walls against a million Dothraki, or </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">so the red priests promise. . . yet why take chances, when their friendship comes so </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">cheap?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Their palanquin was stopped at the gate, the curtains pulled roughly back by </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">one of the house guards. He had the copper skin and dark almond eyes of a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Dothraki, but his face was hairless and he wore the spiked bronze cap of the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Unsullied. He looked them over coldly. Magister Illyrio growled something to him </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the rough Dothraki tongue; the guardsman replied in the same voice and waved </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">them through the gates. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany noticed that her brother’s hand was clenched tightly around the hilt of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his borrowed sword. He looked almost as frightened as she felt. “Insolent eunuch,” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="622" height="22" font="2">Viserys muttered as the palanquin lurched up toward the manse. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio’s words were honey. “Many important men will be at the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">feast tonight. Such men have enemies. The  <i>khal</i>  must protect his guests, yourself </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">chief among them, Your Grace. No doubt the Usurper would pay well for your </text>

<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, yes,” Viserys said darkly. “He has tried, Illyrio, I promise you that. His </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The palanquin slowed and stopped. The curtains were thrown back, and a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">slave offered a hand to help Daenerys out. His collar, she noted, was ordinary </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bronze. Her brother followed, one hand still clenched hard around his sword hilt. It </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="584" height="22" font="2">took two strong men to get Magister Illyrio back on his feet. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">sweet lemon and cinnamon. They were escorted across the entry hall, where a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">mosaic of colored glass depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lanterns all along the walls. Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">their coming. “Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,” he called in </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a high, sweet voice, “King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. His sister, Daenerys Stormborn, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable host, Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of the Free </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="160" height="22" font="2">City of Pentos.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Moonlight painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">among them. Many were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">drooping mustachios bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hung with bells. Yet among them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even fatter than Illyrio, hairy men from the Port of </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Ibben,  and lords from the Summer Isles with skin as black as ebony. Daenerys </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looked at them all in wonder. . . and realized, with a sudden start of fear, that she </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">was the only woman there. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Illyrio whispered to them. “Those three are Drogo’s bloodriders, there,” he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said. “By the pillar is Khal Moro, with his son Rhogoro. The man with the green </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">beard is brother to the Archon of Tyrosh, and the man behind him is Ser Jorah </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">Mormont.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="436" height="22" font="2">The last name caught Daenerys. “A knight?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No less.” Illyrio smiled through his beard. “Anointed with the seven oils by </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">the High Septon himself.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="367" height="22" font="2">“What is he doing here?” she blurted. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Usurper wanted his head,” Illyrio told them. “Some trifling affront. He </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sold some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver instead of giving them to the Night’s Watch. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">Absurd law. A man should be able to do as he likes with his own chattel.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I shall wish to speak with Ser Jorah before the night is done,” her brother </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said. Dany found herself looking at the knight curiously. He was an older man, past </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forty and balding, but still strong and fit. Instead of silks and cottons, he wore wool </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and leather. His tunic was a dark green, embroidered with the likeness of a black </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">bear standing on two legs. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She was still looking at this strange man from the homeland she had never </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">known when Magister Illyrio placed a moist hand on her bare shoulder. “Over </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">there, sweet princess,” he whispered, “there is the <i>khal</i> himself.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany wanted to run and hide, but her brother was looking at her, and if she </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">displeased him she knew she would wake the dragon. Anxiously, she turned and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">looked at the man Viserys hoped would ask to wed her before the night was done. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The  slave girl had not been far wrong, she thought. Khal Drogo was a head </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">taller than the tallest man in the room, yet somehow light on his feet, as graceful as </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the panther in Illyrio’s menagerie. He was younger than she’d thought, no more </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">than thirty. His skin was the color of polished copper, his thick mustachios bound </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">with gold and bronze rings. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I must go and make my submissions,” Magister Illyrio said. “Wait here. I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">shall bring him to you.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Her brother took her by the arm as Illyrio waddled over to the <i>khal</i>, his fingers </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="677" height="22" font="2">squeezing so hard that they hurt. “Do you see his braid, sweet sister?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Drogo’s braid was black as midnight and heavy with scented oil, hung with </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tiny bells that rang softly as he moved. It swung well past his belt, below even his </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="596" height="22" font="2">buttocks, the end of it brushing against the back of his thighs. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“You see how long it is?” Viserys said. “When Dothraki are defeated in </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">combat, they cut off their braids in disgrace, so the world will know their shame. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo has never lost a fight. He is Aegon the Dragonlord come again, and you </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="186" height="22" font="2">will be his queen.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany looked at Khal Drogo. His face was hard and cruel, his eyes as cold and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dark as onyx. Her brother hurt her sometimes, when she woke the dragon, but he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">did not frighten her the way this man frightened her. “I don’t want to be his queen,” </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">she heard herself say in a small, thin voice. “Please, <i>please</i>, Viserys, I don’t want to, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">I want to go home.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Home?</i>” He kept his voice low, but she could hear the fury in his tone. “How </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">are we to go home, sweet sister? They took our home from us!” He drew her into </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the shadows, out of sight, his fingers digging into her skin. “<i>How are we to go </i></text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>home?</i>” he repeated, meaning King’s Landing, and Dragonstone, and all the realm </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">they had lost. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Dany had only meant their rooms  in Illyrio’s estate, no true home surely, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">though all they had, but her brother did not want to hear that. There was no home </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there for him. Even the big house with the red door had not been home for him. His </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fingers dug hard into her arm, demanding an answer. “I don’t know. . .”she said at </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">last, her voice breaking. Tears welled in her eyes. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I do,” he said sharply. “We go home with an army, sweet sister. With Khal </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Drogo’s army, that is how we go home. And if you must wed him and bed him for </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that, you will.” He smiled at her. “I’d let his whole  <i>khalasar</i>  fuck you if need be, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sweet sister, all forty thousand men, and their horses too if that was what it took to </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">get my army. Be grateful it is only Drogo. In time you may even learn to like him. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="2">Now dry your eyes. Illyrio is bringing him over, and he will <i>not</i> see you crying.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany turned and saw that it was true. Magister Illyrio, all smiles and bows, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was escorting Khal Drogo over to where they stood. She brushed away unfallen </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="308" height="22" font="2">tears with the back of her hand. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Smile,” Viserys whispered nervously, his hand failing to the hilt of his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sword. “And stand up straight. Let him see that you have breasts. Gods know, you </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">have little enough as is.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="385" height="22" font="2">Daenerys smiled, and stood up straight. </text>

<text top="318" left="122" width="755" height="22" font="2">sworn swords and freeriders. Over their heads a dozen golden banners </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with the crowned stag of </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">Baratheon. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned knew many of the riders. There came Ser Jaime Lannister with hair as </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bright as beaten gold, and there Sandor Clegane with his terrible burned face. The </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tall boy beside him could only be the crown prince, and that stunted little man </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">behind them was surely the Imp, Tyrion Lannister. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Yet the huge man at the head of the column, flanked by two knights in the </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">snow-white cloaks of the Kingsguard, seemed almost a stranger to Ned. . . until he </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">vaulted off the back of his warhorse with a familiar roar, and crushed him in a bone-</text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crunching hug. “<i>Ned! </i>Ah, but it is good to see that frozen face of yours.” The king </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="735" height="22" font="2">looked him over top to bottom, and laughed. “You have not changed at all.” </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Would that Ned had been able to say the same. Fifteen years past, when they </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had ridden forth to win a throne, the Lord of Storm’s End had been clean-shaven, </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">clear-eyed, and muscled like a maiden’s fantasy. Six and a half feet tall, he towered </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">over lesser men, and when he donned his armor and the great antlered helmet of his </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">House, he became a veritable giant. He’d had a giant’s strength too, his weapon of </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">choice a spiked iron warhammer that Ned could scarcely lift. In those days, the </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="559" height="22" font="2">smell of leather and blood had clung to him like perfume. </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Now it was perfume that clung to him like perfume, and he had a girth to </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">match his height. Ned had last seen the king nine years before during Balon </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy’s rebellion, when the stag and the direwolf had joined to end the </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pretensions of the self-proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Since the night they had </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stood side by side in Greyjoy’s fallen stronghold, where Robert had accepted the </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rebel lord’s surrender and Ned had taken his son Theon as hostage and ward, the </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">king had gained at least eight stone. A beard as coarse and black as iron wire </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">covered his jaw to hide his double chin and the sag of the royal jowls, but nothing </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="554" height="22" font="2">could hide his stomach or the dark circles under his eyes. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Yet Robert was Ned’s king now, and not just a friend, so he said only, “Your </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">forward for their mounts. Robert’s queen, Cersei Lannister, entered on foot with her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">younger children. The wheelhouse in which they had ridden, a huge double-decked </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">carriage of oiled oak and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wide to pass through the castle gate. Ned knelt in the snow to kiss the queen’s ring, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">while Robert embraced Catelyn like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="584" height="22" font="2">brought forward, introduced, and approved of by both sides. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="789" height="22" font="2">said to his host, “Take me down to your crypt, Eddard. I would pay my respects.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">called for a lantern. No other words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">They had been riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">refresh themselves first. The dead would wait. She had said no more than that; </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert had looked at her, and her twin brother Jaime had taken her quietly by the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">arm, and she had said no more. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">They went down to the crypt together, Ned and this king he scarcely </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">recognized. The winding stone steps were narrow. Ned went first with the lantern. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“I was starting to think we would never reach Winterfell,” Robert complained as </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they descended. “In the south, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="561" height="22" font="2">forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="458" height="22" font="2">“I trust you enjoyed the journey, Your Grace?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert snorted. “Bogs and forests and fields, and scarcely a decent inn north </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="773" height="22" font="2">of the Neck. I’ve never seen such a vast emptiness. Where are all your <i>people?</i>” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Likely they were too shy to come out,” Ned jested. He could feel the chill </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">coming up the stairs, a cold breath from deep within the earth. “Kings are a rare </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="186" height="22" font="2">sight in the north.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert snorted. “More likely they were hiding under the snow.  <i>Snow</i>, Ned!” </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="690" height="22" font="2">The king put one hand on the wall to steady himself as they descended. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Late summer snows are common enough,” Ned said. “I hope they did not </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">trouble you. They are usually mild.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Others take your mild snows,” Robert swore. “What will this place be </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="337" height="22" font="2">like in winter? I shudder to think.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The winters are hard,” Ned admitted. “But the Starks will endure. We always </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">have.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You need to come south,” Robert told him. “You need a taste of summer </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">before it flees. In Highgarden there are fields of golden roses that stretch away as </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">far as the eye can see. The fruits are so ripe they explode in your mouth—melons, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">peaches, fireplums, you’ve never tasted such sweetness. You’ll see, I brought you </text>
</page>
<page number="33" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">some. Even at Storm’s End, with that good wind off the bay, the days are so hot you </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">can barely move. And you ought to see the towns, Ned! Flowers everywhere, the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">markets bursting with food, the summerwines so cheap and so good that you can get </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">drunk just breathing the air. Everyone is fat and drunk and rich.” He laughed and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slapped his own ample stomach a thump. “And the <i>girls</i>, Ned!” he exclaimed, his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eyes sparkling. “I swear, women lose all modesty in the heat. They swim naked in </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the river, right beneath the castle. Even in the streets, it’s too damn hot for wool or </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fur, so they go around in these short gowns, silk if they have the silver and cotton if </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not, but it’s all the same when they start sweating and the cloth sticks to their skin, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">they might as well be naked.” The king laughed happily. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert Baratheon had always been a man of huge appetites, a man who knew </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">how to take his pleasures. That was not a charge anyone could lay at the door of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark. Yet Ned could not help but notice that those pleasures were taking a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">toll on the king. Robert was breathing heavily by the time they reached the bottom </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the stairs, his face red in the lantern light as they stepped out into the darkness of </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">the crypt. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace,” Ned said respectfully. He swept the lantern in a wide </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">semicircle. Shadows moved and lurched. Flickering light touched the stones </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">underfoot and brushed against a long procession of granite pillars that marched </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ahead, two by two, into the dark. Between the pillars, the dead sat on their stone </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thrones against the walls, backs against the sepulchres that contained their mortal </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="589" height="22" font="2">remains. “She is down at the end, with Father and Brandon.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He led the way between the pillars and Robert followed wordlessly, shivering </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the subterranean chill. It was always cold down here. Their footsteps rang off the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stones and echoed in the vault overhead as they walked among the dead of House </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Stark.  The Lords of Winterfell watched them pass. Their likenesses were carved </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into the stones that sealed the tombs. In long rows they sat, blind eyes staring out </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">into eternal darkness, while great stone direwolves curled round their feet. The </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">shifting shadows made the stone figures seem to stir as the living passed by. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">By ancient custom an iron longsword had been laid across the lap of each who </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had been Lord of Winterfell, to keep the vengeful spirits in their crypts. The oldest </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had long ago rusted away to nothing, leaving only a few red stains where the metal </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had rested on stone. Ned wondered if that meant those ghosts were free to roam the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">castle now. He hoped not. The first Lords of Winterfell had been men hard as the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">land they ruled. In the centuries before the Dragonlords came over the sea, they had </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">sworn allegiance to no man, styling themselves the Kings in the North. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. Ned did not like </text>
</page>
<page number="34" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">to think on that. “Here,” he told his king. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="493" height="22" font="2">Robert nodded silently, knelt, and bowed his head. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned’s father, had a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">long, stern face. The stonemason had known him well. He sat with quiet dignity, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stone fingers holding tight to the sword across his lap, but in life all swords had </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="675" height="22" font="2">failed him. In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Brandon had been twenty when he died, strangled by order of the Mad King </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Aerys Targaryen only a few short days before he was to wed Catelyn Tully of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Riverrun. His father had been forced to watch him die. He was the true heir, the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="192" height="22" font="2">eldest, born to rule. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lyanna had only been sixteen, a child-woman of surpassing loveliness. Ned </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had loved her with all his heart. Robert had loved her even more. She was to have </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">been his bride. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“She was more beautiful than that,” the king said after a silence. His eyes </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lingered on Lyanna’s face, as if he could will her back to life. Finally he rose, made </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">awkward by his weight. “Ah, damn it, Ned, did you have to bury her in a place like </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="4"><i>this</i>?” His voice was hoarse with remembered grief. “She deserved more than </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="131" height="22" font="2">darkness. . .” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="677" height="22" font="2">“She was a Stark of Winterfell,” Ned said quietly. “This is her place.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“She should be on a hill somewhere, under a fruit tree, with the sun and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="478" height="22" font="2">clouds above her and the rain to wash her clean.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I was with her when she died,” Ned reminded the king. “She wanted to come </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">home, to rest beside Brandon and Father.” He could hear her still at times.<i> Promise </i></text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>me</i>, she had cried, in a room that smelled of blood and roses. <i>Promise me, Ned</i>. The </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister’s eyes. Ned remembered the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remembered nothing. They had found him still holding her body, silent with grief. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">The little crannogman, Howland Reed, had taken her hand from his. Ned could </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">recall none of it. “I bring her flowers when I can,” he said. “Lyanna was. . . fond of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">flowers.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The king touched her cheek, his fingers brushing across the rough stone as </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="779" height="22" font="2">gently as if it were living flesh. “I vowed to kill Rhaegar for what he did to her.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="303" height="22" font="2">“You did,” Ned reminded him. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="330" height="22" font="2">“Only once,” Robert said bitterly. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">They had come together at the ford of the  Trident while the battle crashed </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">around them, Robert with his warhammer and his great antlered helm, the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Targaryen prince armored all in black. On his breastplate was the three-headed </text>
</page>
<page number="35" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dragon of his House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the sunlight. The </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">waters of the Trident ran red around the hooves of their destriers as they circled and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">clashed, again and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert’s hammer stove </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">in the dragon and the chest beneath it. When Ned had finally come on the scene, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Rhaegar lay dead in the stream, while men of both armies scrabbled in the swirling </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="427" height="22" font="2">waters for rubies knocked free of his armor. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“In my dreams, I kill him every night,” Robert admitted. “A thousand deaths </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="337" height="22" font="2">will still be less than he deserves.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was nothing Ned could say to that. After a quiet, he said, “We should </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">return, Your Grace. Your wife will be waiting.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Others take my wife,” Robert muttered sourly, but he started back the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">way they had come, his footsteps falling heavily. “And if I hear ‘Your Grace’ once </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">more, I’ll have your head on a spike. We are more to each other than that.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I had not forgotten,” Ned replied quietly. When the king did not answer, he </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">said, “Tell me about Jon.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert shook his head. “I have never seen a man sicken so quickly. We gave a </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tourney on my son’s name day. If you had seen Jon then, you would have sworn he </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would live forever. A fortnight later he was dead. The sickness was like a fire in his </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gut. It burned right through him.” He paused beside a pillar, before the tomb of a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">long-dead Stark. “I loved that old man.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We both did.” Ned paused a moment. “Catelyn fears for her sister. How does </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">Lysa bear her grief?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert’s mouth gave a bitter twist. “Not well, in truth,” he admitted. “I think </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">losing Jon has driven the woman mad, Ned. She has taken the boy back to the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Eyrie. Against my wishes. I had hoped to foster him with Tywin Lannister at </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock. Jon had no brothers, no other sons. Was I supposed to leave him to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="220" height="22" font="2">be raised by women?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin, but he left </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his doubts unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">slightest word. “The wife has lost the husband,” he said carefully. “Perhaps the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Six, and sickly, and Lord of the Eyrie, gods have mercy,” the king swore. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Lord Tywin had never taken a ward before. Lysa ought to have been honored. The </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lannisters are a great and noble House. She refused to even hear of it. Then she left </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the dead of night, without so much as a by-your-leave. Cersei was furious.” He </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sighed deeply. “The boy is my namesake, did you know that? Robert Arryn. I am </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="699" height="22" font="2">sworn to protect him. How can I do that if his mother steals him away?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I will take him as ward, if you wish,” Ned said. “Lysa should consent to that. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">She and Catelyn were close as girls, and she would be welcome here as well.” </text>
</page>
<page number="36" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A generous offer, my friend,” the king said, “but too late. Lord Tywin has </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">already given his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">to him.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I have more concern for my nephew’s welfare than I do for Lannister pride,” </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">Ned declared. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“That is because you do not sleep with a Lannister.” Robert laughed, the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sound rattling among the tombs and bouncing from the vaulted ceiling. His smile </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was a flash of white teeth in the thicket of the huge black beard. “Ah, Ned,” he said, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“you are still too serious.” He put a massive arm around Ned’s shoulders. “I had </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">planned to wait a few days to speak to you, but I see  now there’s no need for it. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="223" height="22" font="2">Come, walk with me.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">They started back down between the pillars. Blind stone eyes seemed to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">follow them as they passed. The king kept his arm around Ned’s shoulder. “You </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="726" height="22" font="2">must have wondered why I finally came north to Winterfell, after so long.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned had his suspicions, but he did not give them voice. “For the joy of my </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">company, surely,” he said lightly. “And there is the Wall. You need to see it, Your </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Grace, to walk along its battlements and talk to those who man it. The Night’s </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">Watch is a shadow of what it once was. Benjen says—” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No doubt I will hear what your brother says soon enough,” Robert said. “The </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Wall has stood for what, eight thousand years? It can keep a few days more. I have </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">more pressing concerns. These are difficult times. I need good men about me. Men </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">like Jon Arryn. He served as Lord of the Eyrie, as Warden of the East, as the Hand </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">of the King. He will not be easy to replace.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="245" height="22" font="2">“His son. . .” Ned began. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“His son will succeed to the Eyrie and all its incomes,” Robert said brusquely. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="118" height="22" font="2">“No more.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">That took Ned by surprise. He stopped, startled, and turned to look at his king. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">The words came unbidden. “The Arryns have always been Wardens of the East. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="315" height="22" font="2">The title goes with the domain.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps when he comes of age, the honor can be restored to him,” Robert </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">said. “I have this year to think of, and next. A six-year-old boy is no war leader, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">Ned.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“In peace, the title is only an honor. Let the boy keep it. For his father’s sake </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="601" height="22" font="2">if not his own. Surely you owe Jon that much for his service.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The king was not pleased. He took his arm from around Ned’s shoulders. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Jon’s service was the duty he owed his liege lord. I am not ungrateful, Ned. You of </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">all men ought to know that. But the son is not the father. A mere boy cannot hold </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the east.” Then his tone softened. “Enough of this. There is a more important office </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to discuss, and I would not argue with you.” Robert grasped Ned by the elbow. “I </text>

<page number="37" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">have need of you, Ned.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I am yours to command, Your Grace. Always.” They were words he had to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="663" height="22" font="2">say, and so he said them, apprehensive about what might come next. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="774" height="22" font="2">Robert scarcely seemed to hear him. “Those years we spent in the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Eyrie. . . <i>gods</i>, those were good years. I want you at my side again, Ned. I want you </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">down in King’s Landing, not up here at the end of the world where you are no </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">damned use to anybody.” Robert looked off into the darkness, for a moment as </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">melancholy as a Stark. “I swear to you, sitting a throne is a thousand times harder </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">than winning one. Laws are a tedious business and counting coppers is worse. And </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the people. . . there is no end of them. I sit on that damnable iron chair and listen to </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them complain until my mind is numb and my ass is raw. They all want something, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">money or land or justice. The lies they tell. . . and my lords and ladies are no better. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">I am surrounded by flatterers and fools. It can drive a man to madness, Ned. Half of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them don’t dare tell me the truth, and the other half can’t find it. There are nights I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">wish we had lost at the Trident. Ah, no, not truly, but. . .  </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="310" height="22" font="2">“I understand,” Ned said softly. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robert looked at him. “I think you do. If so, you are the only one, my old </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">friend.” He smiled. “Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the King.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned dropped to one knee. The offer did not surprise him; what other reason </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">could Robert have had for coming so far? The Hand of the King was the second-</text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">most powerful man in the Seven Kingdoms. He spoke with the king’s voice, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commanded the king’s armies, drafted the king’s laws. At times he even sat upon </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Iron Throne to dispense king’s justice, when the king was absent, or sick, or </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">otherwise indisposed. Robert was offering him a responsibility as large as the realm </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">itself. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="426" height="22" font="2">It was the last thing in the world he wanted. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace,” he said. “I am not worthy of the honor.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert groaned with good-humored impatience. “If I wanted to honor you, I’d </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">let you retire. I am planning to make you run the kingdom and fight the wars while I </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">eat and drink and wench myself into an early grave.” He slapped his gut and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="610" height="22" font="2">grinned. “You know the saying, about the king and his Hand?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="723" height="22" font="2">Ned knew the saying. “What the king dreams,” he said, “the Hand builds.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I bedded a fishmaid once who told me the lowborn have a choicer way to put </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it. The king eats, they say, and the Hand takes the shit.” He threw back his head and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">roared his laughter. The echoes rang through the darkness, and all around them the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="671" height="22" font="2">dead of Winterfell seemed to watch with cold and disapproving eyes. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Finally the laughter dwindled and stopped. Ned was still on one knee, his eyes </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">upraised. “Damn it, Ned,” the king complained. “You might at least humor me with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">a smile.” </text>
</page>
<page number="38" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“They say it grows so cold up here in winter that a man’s laughter freezes in </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his throat and chokes him to death,” Ned said evenly. “Perhaps that is why the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="280" height="22" font="2">Starks have so little humor.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Come south with me, and I’ll teach you how to laugh again,” the king </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">promised. “You helped me win this damnable throne, now help me hold it. We were </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">meant to rule together. If Lyanna had lived, we should have been brothers, bound </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">by blood as well as affection. Well, it is not too late. I have a son. You have a </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">daughter. My Joff and your Sansa shall join our houses, as Lyanna and I might once </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">have done.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="498" height="22" font="2">This offer <i>did</i> surprise him. “Sansa is only eleven.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert waved an impatient hand. “Old enough for betrothal. The marriage can </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="735" height="22" font="2">wait a few years.” The king smiled. “Now stand up and say yes, curse you.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Nothing would give me greater pleasure, Your Grace,” Ned answered. He </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hesitated. “These honors are all so unexpected. May I have some time to consider? I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">need to tell my wife. . .” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes, yes, of course, tell Catelyn, sleep on it if you must.” The king reached </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down, clasped Ned by the hand, and pulled him roughly to his feet. “Just don’t keep </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="540" height="22" font="2">me waiting too long. I am not the most patient of men.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">For a moment Eddard Stark was filled with a terrible sense of foreboding. <i>This</i> </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was his place, here in the north. He looked at the stone figures all around them, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">breathed deep in the chill silence of the crypt. He could feel the eyes of the dead. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">They were all listening, he knew. And winter was coming. </text>

<text top="290" left="122" width="748" height="22" font="2">bastard. As he filled his wine cup once more from a passing flagon, it struck </text>
<text top="318" left="122" width="343" height="22" font="2">him that this might be one of them. </text>
<text top="345" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">He settled back in his place on the bench among the younger squires and </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">drank. The sweet, fruity taste of summerwine filled his mouth and brought a smile </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">to his lips. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Great Hall of Winterfell was hazy with smoke and heavy with the smell </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">of roasted meat and fresh-baked  bread. Its grey stone walls were draped with </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">banners. White, gold, crimson: the direwolf of Stark, Baratheon’s crowned stag, the </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lion of Lannister. A singer was playing the high harp and reciting a ballad, but </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down at this end of the hall his voice could scarcely be heard above the roar of the </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fire, the clangor of pewter plates and cups, and the low mutter of a hundred drunken </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="2">conversations. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was the fourth hour of the welcoming feast laid for the king. Jon’s brothers </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and sisters had been seated with the  royal children, beneath the raised platform </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">where Lord and Lady Stark hosted the king and queen. In honor of the occasion, his </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lord father would doubtless permit each child a glass of wine, but no more than that. </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Down here on the benches, there was no one to stop Jon drinking as much as he had </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="112" height="22" font="2">a thirst for. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And he was finding that he had a man’s thirst, to the raucous delight of the </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">youths around him, who urged him on every time he drained a glass. They were fine </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">company, and Jon relished the stories they were telling, tales of battle and bedding </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the hunt. He was certain that his companions were more entertaining than the </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">king’s offspring. He had sated his curiosity about the visitors when they made their </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">entrance. The procession had passed not a foot from the place he had been given on </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="572" height="22" font="2">the bench, and Jon had gotten a good long look at them all. </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His lord father had come first, escorting the queen. She was as beautiful as </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">men said. A jeweled tiara gleamed amidst her long golden hair, its emeralds a </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">perfect match for the green of her eyes. His father helped her up the steps to the dais </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and led her to her seat, but the queen never so much as looked at him. Even at </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">fourteen, Jon could see through her smile. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Next had come King Robert himself, with Lady Stark on his arm. The king </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was a great disappointment to Jon. His father had talked of him often: the peerless </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Robert Baratheon, demon of the Trident, the fiercest warrior of the realm, a giant </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">among princes. Jon saw only a fat man, red-faced under his beard, sweating through </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">his silks. He walked like a man half in his cups. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">After them came the children. Little Rickon first, managing the long walk </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with all the dignity a three-year-old could muster. Jon had to urge him on when he </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stopped to visit. Close behind came  Robb, in grey wool trimmed with white, the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Stark colors. He had the Princess Myrcella on his arm. She was a wisp of a girl, not </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">quite eight, her hair a cascade of golden curls under a jeweled net. Jon noticed the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shy looks she gave Robb as they passed between the tables and the timid way she </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">smiled at him. He decided she was insipid. Robb didn’t even have the sense to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="539" height="22" font="2">realize how stupid she was; he was grinning like a fool. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His half sisters escorted the royal princes. Arya was paired with plump young </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Tommen, whose white-blond hair was longer than hers. Sansa, two years older, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">drew the crown prince, Joffrey Baratheon. He was twelve, younger than Jon or </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Robb, but taller than either, to Jon’s vast dismay. Prince Joffrey had his sister’s hair </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and his mother’s deep green eyes. A thick tangle of blond curls dripped down past </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his golden choker and high velvet collar. Sansa looked radiant as she walked beside </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him, but Jon did not like Joffrey’s pouty lips or the bored, disdainful way he looked </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">at Winterfell’s Great Hall. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen’s brothers, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">which was which. Ser Jaime Lannister was twin to Queen Cersei; tall and golden, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with flashing  green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">high black boots, a black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">House was embroidered in gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">Lion of Lannister to his face and whispered “Kingslayer” behind his back. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon found it hard to look away from him. <i>This is what a king should look like</i>, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">he thought to himself as the man passed. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother’s side. </text>

<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was too large for his body, with a brute’s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of brow. One green eye and one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="585" height="22" font="2">so blond it seemed white. Jon watched him with fascination. </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as he went by. Theon ignored him utterly, but there was nothing new in that. After </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all had been seated, toasts were made, thanks were given and returned, and then the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">feasting began. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="524" height="22" font="2">Jon had started drinking then, and he had not stopped. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Something rubbed against his leg beneath the table. Jon saw red eyes staring </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">up at him. “Hungry again?” he asked. There was still half a honeyed chicken in the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">center of the table. Jon reached out to tear off a leg, then had a better idea. He </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knifed the bird whole and let the carcass slide to the floor between his legs. Ghost </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ripped into it in savage silence. His brothers and sisters had not been permitted to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bring their wolves to the banquet, but there were more curs than Jon could count at </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">this end of the hall, and no one had said a word about his pup. He told himself he </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">was fortunate in that too. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">His eyes stung. Jon rubbed at them savagely, cursing the smoke. He </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="756" height="22" font="2">swallowed another gulp of wine and watched his direwolf devour the chicken. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dogs moved between the tables, trailing after the serving girls. One of them, a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">black mongrel bitch with long yellow eyes, caught a scent of the chicken. She </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stopped and edged under  the bench to get a share. Jon watched the confrontation. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The bitch growled low in her throat and moved closer. Ghost looked up, silent, and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fixed the dog with those hot red eyes. The bitch snapped an angry challenge. She </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was three times the size of the direwolf pup. Ghost did not move. He stood over his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">prize and opened his mouth, baring his fangs. The bitch tensed, barked again, then </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thought better of this fight. She turned and slunk away, with one last defiant snap to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">save her pride. Ghost went back to his meal. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon grinned and reached under the table to ruffle the shaggy white fur. The </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="761" height="22" font="2">direwolf looked up at him, nipped gently at his hand, then went back to eating. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Is this one of the direwolves I’ve heard so much of?” a familiar voice asked </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">close at hand. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon looked up happily as his uncle Ben put a hand on his head and ruffled his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="749" height="22" font="2">hair much as Jon had ruffled the wolf’s. “Yes,” he said. “His name is Ghost.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">One of the squires interrupted the bawdy story he’d been telling to make room </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">at the table for their lord’s brother. Benjen Stark straddled the bench with long legs </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and took the wine cup out of Jon’s hand. “Summerwine,” he said after a taste. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">“Nothing so sweet. How many cups have you had, Jon?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="115" height="22" font="2">Jon smiled. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ben Stark laughed. “As I feared. Ah, well. I believe I was younger than you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the first time I got truly and sincerely drunk.” He snagged a roasted onion, dripping </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">brown with gravy, from a nearby trencher and bit into it. It crunched. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His uncle was sharp-featured and gaunt as a mountain crag, but there was </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">always a hint of laughter in his blue-grey eyes. He dressed in black, as befitted a </text>

<page number="42" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">man of the Night’s Watch. Tonight it was rich black velvet, with high leather boots </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and a wide belt with a silver buckle. A heavy silver chain was looped round his </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">neck. Benjen watched Ghost with amusement as he ate his onion. “A very quiet </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="194" height="22" font="2">wolf,” he observed. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He’s not like the others,” Jon said. “He never makes a sound. That’s why I </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">named him Ghost. That, and because he’s white. The others are all dark, grey or </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">black.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“There are still direwolves beyond the Wall. We hear them on our rangings.” </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Benjen Stark gave Jon a long look. “Don’t you usually eat at table with your </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">brothers?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Most times,” Jon answered in a flat voice. “But tonight Lady Stark thought it </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="654" height="22" font="2">might give insult to the royal family to seat a bastard among them.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I see.” His uncle glanced over his shoulder at the raised table at the far end of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="560" height="22" font="2">the hall. “My brother does not seem very festive tonight.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon had noticed that too. A bastard had to learn to notice things, to read the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">truth that people hid behind their eyes. His father was observing all the courtesies, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">but there was tightness in him that Jon had seldom seen before. He said little, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">looking out over the hall with hooded eyes, seeing nothing. Two  seats away, the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">king had been drinking heavily all night. His broad face was flushed behind his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">great black beard. He made many a toast, laughed loudly at every jest, and attacked </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">each dish like a starving man, but beside him the queen seemed as cold as an ice </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sculpture. “The queen is angry too,” Jon told his uncle in a low, quiet voice. “Father </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">took the king down to the crypts this afternoon. The queen didn’t want him to go.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Benjen gave Jon a careful, measuring look. “You don’t miss much, do you, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">Jon? We could use a man like you on the Wall.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon swelled with pride. “Robb is a stronger lance than I am, but I’m the better </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">sword, and Hullen says I sit a horse as well as anyone in the castle.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="246" height="22" font="2">“Notable achievements.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Take me with you when you go back to the Wall,” Jon said in a sudden rush. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="627" height="22" font="2">“Father will give me leave to go if you ask him, I know he will.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Uncle Benjen studied his face carefully. “The Wall is a hard place for a boy, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">Jon.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I am almost a man grown,” Jon protested. “I will turn fifteen on my next </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">name day, and Maester Luwin says bastards grow up faster than other children.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“That’s true enough,” Benjen said with a downward twist of his mouth. He </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">took Jon’s cup from the table, filled it fresh from a nearby pitcher, and drank down </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="157" height="22" font="2">a long swallow. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="411" height="22" font="2">The Young Dragon was one of his heroes. </text>
</page>
<page number="43" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A conquest that lasted a summer,” his uncle pointed out. “Your Boy King </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty trying to hold it. Someone </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">should have told him that war isn’t a game.” He took another sip of wine. “Also,” </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he said, wiping his mouth, “Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="294" height="22" font="2">have you forgotten that part?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I forget nothing,” Jon boasted. The wine was making him bold. He tried to sit </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">very straight, to make himself seem taller. “I want to serve in the Night’s Watch, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="80" height="22" font="2">Uncle.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He had thought on it long and hard, lying abed at night while his brothers slept </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around him. Robb would someday inherit Winterfell, would command great armies </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as the Warden of the North. Bran and Rickon would be Robb’s bannermen and rule </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">holdfasts in his name. His sisters Arya and Sansa would marry the heirs of other </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">great houses and go south as mistress of castles of their own. But what place could a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">bastard hope to earn? </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“You don’t know what you’re asking, Jon. The Night’s Watch is a sworn </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brotherhood. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons. Our wife is </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="283" height="22" font="2">duty. Our mistress is honor.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="725" height="22" font="2">“A bastard can have honor too,” Jon said. “I am ready to swear your oath.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You are a boy of fourteen,” Benjen said. “Not a man, not yet. Until you have </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">known a woman, you cannot understand what you would be giving up.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="392" height="22" font="2">“I don’t care about that!” Jon said hotly. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You might, if you knew what it meant,” Benjen said. “If you knew what the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">oath would cost you, you might be less eager to pay the price, son.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="486" height="22" font="2">Jon felt anger rise inside him. “I’m not your son!” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Benjen Stark stood up. “More’s the pity.” He put a hand on Jon’s shoulder. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Come back to me after you’ve fathered a few bastards of your own, and we’ll see </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">how you feel.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon trembled. “I will never father a bastard,” he said carefully. “<i>Never!</i>” He </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="220" height="22" font="2">spat it out like venom. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Suddenly he realized that the table had fallen silent, and they were all looking </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="815" height="22" font="2">at him. He felt the tears begin to well behind his eyes. He pushed himself to his feet. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I must be excused,” he said with the last of his dignity. He whirled and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bolted before they could see him cry. He must have drunk more wine than he had </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">realized.  His feet got tangled under him as he tried to leave, and he lurched </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sideways into a serving girl and sent a flagon of spiced wine crashing to the floor. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Laughter boomed all around him, and Jon felt hot tears on his cheeks. Someone </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tried to steady him. He wrenched free of their grip and ran, half-blind, for the door. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">Ghost followed close at his heels, out into the night. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The yard was quiet and empty. A lone sentry stood high on the battlements of </text>
</page>
<page number="44" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the inner wall, his cloak pulled tight around him against the cold. He looked bored </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and miserable as he huddled there alone, but Jon would have traded places with him </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">in an instant. Otherwise the castle was dark and deserted. Jon had seen an </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">abandoned holdfast once, a drear place where nothing moved but the wind and the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stones kept silent about whatever people had lived there. Winterfell reminded him </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">of that tonight. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The sounds of music and song spilled through the open windows behind him. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">They were the last things Jon wanted to hear. He wiped away his tears on the sleeve </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">of his shirt, furious that he had let them fall, and turned to go. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="435" height="22" font="2">“Boy,” a voice called out to him. Jon turned. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister was sitting on the ledge above the door to the Great Hall, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looking for all the world like a gargoyle. The dwarf grinned down at him. “Is that </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">animal a wolf?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“A direwolf,” Jon said. “His name is Ghost.” He stared up at the little man, his </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">disappointment suddenly forgotten. “What are you doing up there? Why aren’t you </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="131" height="22" font="2">at the feast?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Too hot, too noisy, and I’d drunk too much  wine,” the dwarf told him. “I </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">learned long ago that it is considered rude to vomit on your brother. Might I have a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">closer look at your wolf?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon hesitated, then nodded slowly. “Can you climb down, or shall I bring a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">ladder?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Oh, bleed that,” the little man said. He pushed himself off the ledge into </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">empty air. Jon gasped, then watched with awe as Tyrion Lannister spun around in a </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">tight ball, landed lightly on his hands, then vaulted backward onto his legs. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="410" height="22" font="2">Ghost backed away from him uncertainly. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The dwarf  dusted himself off and laughed. “I believe I’ve frightened your </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="210" height="22" font="2">wolf. My apologies.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He’s not scared,” Jon said. He knelt and called out. “Ghost, come here. Come </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">on. That’s it.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The wolf pup padded closer and nuzzled at Jon’s face, but he kept a wary eye </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on Tyrion Lannister, and when the dwarf reached out to pet him, he drew back and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="663" height="22" font="2">bared his fangs in a silent snarl. “Shy, isn’t he?” Lannister observed. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Sit, Ghost,” Jon commanded. “That’s it. Keep still.” He looked up at the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">dwarf. “You can touch him now. He won’t move until I tell him to. I’ve been </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">training him.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I see,” Lannister said. He ruffled the snow-white fur between Ghost’s ears </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="220" height="22" font="2">and said, “Nice wolf.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If I wasn’t here, he’d tear out your throat,” Jon said. It wasn’t actually true </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="198" height="22" font="2">yet, but it would be. </text>

<page number="45" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“In that case, you had best stay close,” the dwarf said. He cocked his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">oversized head to one side and looked Jon over with his mismatched eyes. “I am </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I know,” Jon said. He rose. Standing, he was taller than the dwarf. It made </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">him feel strange. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="411" height="22" font="2">“You’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon felt a coldness pass right through him. He pressed his lips together and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">said nothing. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Did I offend you?” Lannister said. “Sorry. Dwarfs don’t have to be tactful. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Generations of capering fools in motley have won me the right to dress badly and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">say any damn thing that comes into my head.” He grinned. “You  <i>are</i>  the bastard, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">though.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard Stark is my father,” Jon admitted stiffly. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lannister studied his face. “Yes,” he said. “I can see it. You have more of the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">north in you than your brothers.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Half brothers,” Jon corrected. He was pleased by the dwarf’s comment, but </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="252" height="22" font="2">he tried not to let it show. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Let me give you some counsel, bastard,” Lannister said. “Never forget what </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon was in no mood for anyone’s counsel. “What do you know about being a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">bastard?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="458" height="22" font="2">“All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“You are your mother’s trueborn son of Lannister.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Am I?” the dwarf replied, sardonic. “Do tell my lord father. My mother died </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">birthing me, and he’s never been sure.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“I don’t even know who my mother was,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are.” He favored Jon with a rueful </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grin. “Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dwarfs.” And with that he turned and sauntered back into the feast, whistling a tune. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">When he opened the door, the light from within threw his shadow clear across the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">yard, and for just a moment Tyrion Lannister stood tall as a king. </text>

<text top="262" left="132" width="739" height="22" font="2">f all the rooms in Winterfell’s Great Keep, Catelyn’s bedchambers were the </text>
<text top="290" left="132" width="739" height="22" font="2">hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. The castle had been built over natural </text>
<text top="318" left="132" width="740" height="22" font="2">hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">like blood through a man’s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="618" height="22" font="2">summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death. </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn’s bath was always hot and steaming, and her walls warm to the touch. </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The warmth reminded her of Riverrun, of days in the sun with Lysa and Edmure, </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but Ned could never abide the heat. The Starks were made for the cold, he would </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tell her, and she would laugh and tell him in that case they had certainly built their </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">castle in the wrong place. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">So  when they had finished, Ned rolled off and climbed from her bed, as he </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had a thousand times before. He crossed the room, pulled back the heavy tapestries, </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and threw open the high narrow windows one by one, letting the night air into the </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">chamber. </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">The wind swirled around him as he stood facing the dark, naked and empty-</text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">handed. Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him. He looked somehow </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">smaller and more vulnerable, like the youth she had wed in the sept at Riverrun, </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fifteen long years gone. Her loins still ached from the urgency of his lovemaking. It </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was a good ache. She could feel his seed within her. She prayed that it might </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">quicken there. It had been three years since Rickon. She was not too old. She could </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="214" height="22" font="2">give him another son. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I will refuse him,” Ned said as he turned back to her. His eyes were haunted, </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">his voice thick with doubt. </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">Catelyn sat up in the bed. “You cannot. You <i>must</i> not.” </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="682" height="22" font="2">“My duties are here in the north. I have no wish to be Robert’s Hand.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He will not understand that. He is a king now, and kings are not like other </text>

<text top="1063" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">begin to suspect that you oppose him. Can’t you see the danger that would put us </text>

<page number="47" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned shook his head, refusing to believe. “Robert would never harm me or any </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of mine. We were closer than brothers. He loves me. If I refuse him, he will roar </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and curse and bluster, and in a week we will laugh about it together. I know the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="66" height="22" font="2">man!” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You knew the man,” she said. “The king is a stranger to you.” Catelyn </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">remembered the direwolf dead in the snow, the broken antler lodged deep in her </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">throat. She had to make him see. “Pride is everything to a king, my lord. Robert </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">came all this way to see you, to bring you these great honors, you cannot throw </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">them back in his face.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="318" height="22" font="2">“Honors?” Ned laughed bitterly. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="269" height="22" font="2">“In his eyes, yes,” she said. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="163" height="22" font="2">“And in yours?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>And  </i>in mine,” she blazed, angry now. Why couldn’t he see? “He offers his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">own son in marriage to our daughter, what else would you call that? Sansa might </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">someday be queen. Her sons could rule from the Wall to the mountains of Dorne. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">What is so wrong with that?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Gods, Catelyn, Sansa is only  <i>eleven</i>,” Ned said. “And Joffrey. . . Joffrey </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">is. . .” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She finished for him. “. . . crown prince, and heir to the Iron Throne. And I </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="705" height="22" font="2">was only twelve when my father promised me to your brother Brandon.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That brought a bitter twist to Ned’s mouth. “Brandon.  Yes. Brandon would </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">know what to do. He always did. It was all meant for Brandon.  You, Winterfell, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">everything. He was born to be a King’s Hand and a father to queens. I never asked </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">for this cup to pass to me.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps not,” Catelyn said, “but Brandon is dead, and the cup has passed, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="411" height="22" font="2">and you must drink from it, like it or not.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned turned away from her, back to the night. He stood staring out in the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">darkness, watching the moon and the stars perhaps, or perhaps the sentries on the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">wall. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Catelyn softened then, to see his pain. Eddard Stark had married her in </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Brandon’s  place, as custom decreed, but the shadow of his dead brother still lay </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">between them, as did the other, the shadow of the woman he would not name, the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">woman who had borne him his bastard son. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She was about to go to him when the knock came at the door, loud and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="472" height="22" font="2">unexpected. Ned turned, frowning. “What is it?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Desmond’s voice came through the door. “My lord, Maester Luwin is without </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">and begs urgent audience.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="510" height="22" font="2">“You told him I had left orders not to be disturbed?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="264" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord. He insists.” </text>
</page>
<page number="48" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="257" height="22" font="2">“Very well. Send him in.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned crossed to the wardrobe and slipped on a heavy robe. Catelyn realized </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">suddenly how cold it had become. She sat up in bed and pulled the furs to her chin. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps we should close the windows,” she suggested. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="509" height="22" font="2">Ned nodded absently. Maester Luwin was shown in. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The maester was a small grey man. His eyes were grey, and quick, and saw </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">much. His hair was grey, what little the years had left him. His robe was grey wool, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">trimmed with white fur, the Stark colors. Its great floppy sleeves had pockets </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hidden inside. Luwin was always tucking things into those sleeves and producing </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">other things from them: books, messages, strange artifacts, toys for the children. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">With all he kept hidden in his sleeves, Catelyn was surprised that Maester Luwin </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">could lift his arms at all. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The maester waited until the door had closed behind him before he spoke. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“My lord,” he said to Ned, “pardon for disturbing your rest. I have been left a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="104" height="22" font="2">message.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned looked irritated. “Been <i>left</i>? By whom? Has there been a rider? I was not </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">told.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in my </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">observatory while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">by someone in the king’s party. We have had no other visitors from the south.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="397" height="22" font="2">“A wooden box, you say?” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Inside was a fine new lens for the observatory, from Myr by the look of it. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned. He had little patience for this sort of thing, Catelyn knew. “A </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="449" height="22" font="2">lens,” he said. “What has that to do with me?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I asked the same question,” Maester Luwin said. “Clearly there was more to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">this than the seeming.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Under the heavy weight of her furs, Catelyn shivered. “A lens is an instrument </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="153" height="22" font="2">to help us see.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Indeed it is.” He fingered the collar of his order; a heavy chain worn tight </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="714" height="22" font="2">around the neck beneath his robe, each link forged from a different metal. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn could feel dread stirring inside her once again. “What is it that they </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">would have us see more clearly?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The very thing I asked myself.” Maester Luwin drew a tightly rolled paper </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">out of his sleeve. “I found the true message concealed within a false bottom when I </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="649" height="22" font="2">dismantled the box the lens had come in, but it is not for my eyes.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="447" height="22" font="2">Ned held out his hand. “Let me have it, then.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Luwin did not stir. “Pardons, my lord. The message is not for you either. It is </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">marked for the eyes of the Lady Catelyn, and her alone. May I approach?” </text>
</page>
<page number="49" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn nodded, not trusting to speak. The maester placed the paper on the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">table beside the bed. It was sealed with a small blob of blue wax. Luwin bowed and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">began to retreat. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stay,” Ned commanded him. His voice was grave. He looked at Catelyn. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">“What is it? My lady, you’re shaking.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’m afraid,” she admitted. She reached out and took the letter in trembling </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hands. The furs dropped away from her nakedness, forgotten. In the blue wax was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the moon-and-falcon seal of House Arryn. “It’s from Lysa.” Catelyn looked at her </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">husband. “It will not make us glad,” she told him. “There is grief in this message, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">Ned. I can feel it.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned, his face darkening. “Open it.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="226" height="22" font="2">Catelyn broke the seal. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her eyes moved over the words. At first they made no sense to her. Then she </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">remembered. “Lysa took no chances. When we were girls together, we had a private </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">language, she and I.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="185" height="22" font="2">“Can you read it?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="247" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Catelyn admitted. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="147" height="22" font="2">“Then tell us.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="493" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps I should withdraw,” Maester Luwin said. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No,” Catelyn said. “We will need your counsel.” She threw back the furs and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">climbed from the bed. The night air was as cold as the grave on her bare skin as she </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">padded across the room. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin averted his eyes. Even Ned looked  shocked. “What are you </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="177" height="22" font="2">doing?” he asked. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lighting a fire,” Catelyn told him. She found a dressing gown and shrugged </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">into it, then knelt over the cold hearth. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="313" height="22" font="2">“Maester Luwin—” Ned began. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Maester Luwin has delivered all my children,” Catelyn said. “This is no time </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for false modesty.” She slid the paper in among the kindling and placed the heavier </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="164" height="22" font="2">logs on top of it. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned crossed the room, took her by the arm, and pulled her to her feet. He held </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="773" height="22" font="2">her there, his face inches from her. “My lady, tell me! What was this message?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn stiffened in his grasp. “A warning,” she said softly. “If we have the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">wits to hear.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="359" height="22" font="2">His eyes searched her face. “Go on.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="371" height="22" font="2">“Lysa says Jon Arryn was murdered.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="455" height="22" font="2">His fingers tightened on her arm. “By whom?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="441" height="22" font="2">“The Lannisters,” she told him. “The queen.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned released his hold on her arm. There were deep red marks on her skin. </text>
</page>
<page number="50" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“Gods,” he whispered. His voice was hoarse. “Your sister is sick with grief. She </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">cannot know what she is saying.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“She knows,” Catelyn said. “Lysa is impulsive, yes, but this message was </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">carefully planned, cleverly hidden. She knew it meant death if her letter fell into the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">wrong hands. To risk so much, she must have had more than mere suspicion.” </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Catelyn looked to her husband. “Now we truly have no choice. You  <i>must</i>  be </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">Robert’s Hand. You must go south with him and learn the truth.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She saw at once that Ned had reached a very different conclusion. “The only </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="773" height="22" font="2">truths I know are here. The south is a nest of adders I would do better to avoid.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Luwin plucked at his chain collar where it had chafed the soft skin of his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">throat. “The Hand of the King has great power, my lord. Power to find the truth of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lord Arryn’s death, to bring his killers to the king’s justice. Power to protect Lady </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="390" height="22" font="2">Arryn and her son, if the worst be true.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned glanced helplessly around the bedchamber. Catelyn’s heart went out to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him, but she knew she could not take him in her arms just then. First the victory </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">must be won, for her children’s sake. “You say you love Robert like a brother. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">Would you leave your brother surrounded by Lannisters?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Others take both of you,” Ned muttered darkly. He turned away from </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them and went to the window. She did not speak, nor did the maester. They waited, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">quiet, while Eddard Stark said a silent farewell to the home he loved. When he </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">turned away from the window at last, his voice was tired and full of melancholy, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and moisture glittered faintly in the corners of his eyes. “My father went south </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="671" height="22" font="2">once, to answer the summons of a king. He never came home again.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="579" height="22" font="2">“A different time,” Maester Luwin said. “A different king.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Ned said dully. He seated himself in a chair by the hearth. “Catelyn, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">you shall stay here in Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His words were like an icy draft through her heart. “No,” she said, suddenly </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">afraid. Was this to be her punishment? Never to see his face again, nor to feel his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">arms around her? </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Ned said, in words that would brook no argument. “You must govern </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the north in my stead, while I run Robert’s errands. There must always be a Stark in </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell. Robb is fourteen. Soon enough, he will be a man grown. He must learn </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to rule, and I will not be here for him. Make him part of your councils. He must be </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">ready when his time comes.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="584" height="22" font="2">“Gods will, not for many years,” Maester Luwin murmured. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Maester Luwin, I trust you  as I would my own blood. Give my wife your </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">voice in all things great and small. Teach my son the things he needs to know. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">Winter is coming.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin nodded gravely. Then silence fell, until Catelyn found her </text>
</page>
<page number="51" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">courage and asked the question whose answer she most dreaded. “What of the other </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">children?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned stood, and took her in his arms, and held her face close to his. “Rickon is </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">very young,” he said gently. “He should stay here with you and Robb. The others I </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">would take with me.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="440" height="22" font="2">“I could not bear it,” Catelyn said, trembling. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You must,” he said. “Sansa must wed Joffrey, that is clear now, we must give </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them no grounds to suspect our devotion. And it is past time that Arya learned the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">ways of a southron court. In a few years she will be of an age to marry too.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa would shine in the south, Catelyn thought to herself, and the gods knew </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that Arya needed refinement. Reluctantly, she let go of them in her heart. But not </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Bran. Never Bran. “Yes,” she said, “but please, Ned, for the love you bear me, let </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="489" height="22" font="2">Bran remain here at Winterfell. He is only seven.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I was eight when my father sent me to foster at the Eyrie,” Ned said. “Ser </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Rodrik tells me there is bad feeling between Robb and Prince Joffrey. That is not </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">healthy. Bran can bridge that distance. He is a sweet boy, quick to laugh, easy to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">love. Let him grow up with the young princes, let him become their friend as Robert </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">became mine. Our House will be the safer for it.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He was right; Catelyn knew it. It did not make the pain any easier to bear. She </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would lose all four of them, then: Ned, and both girls, and her sweet, loving Bran. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Only Robb and little Rickon would be left to her. She felt lonely already. Winterfell </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was such a vast place. “Keep him off the walls, then,” she said bravely. “You know </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">how Bran loves to climb.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned kissed the tears from her eyes before they could fall. “Thank you, my </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">lady,” he whispered. “This is hard, I know.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="522" height="22" font="2">“What of Jon Snow, my lord?” Maester Luwin asked. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">pulled away. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man’s needs, after </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">expected he would see to the child’s needs. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bastard home with him, and called him “son” for all the north to see. When the wars </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already </text>
</page>
<page number="52" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">taken up residence. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the lips of her husband’s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys’s Kingsguard, and of how </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had carried Ser Arthur’s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea.  The Lady Ashara </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">the truth of it, asked him to his face. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Never ask me about Jon,” he said, cold as ice. “He is my blood, and that is all you </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.” She had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="614" height="22" font="2">and Ashara Dayne’s name was never heard in Winterfell again. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Whoever Jon’s  mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bastards for Ned’s sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="674" height="22" font="2">bore him. Somehow that made it worse. “Jon must go,” she said now. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="518" height="22" font="2">“He and Robb are close,” Ned said. “I had hoped. . .” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He cannot stay here,” Catelyn said, cutting him off. “He is your son, not </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mine. I will not have him.” It was hard, she knew, but no less the truth. Ned would </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="558" height="22" font="2">do the boy no kindness by leaving him here at Winterfell. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The look Ned gave her was anguished. “You know I cannot take him south. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">There will be no place for him at court. A boy with a bastard’s name. . . you know </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">what they will say of him. He will be shunned.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Catelyn armored her heart against the mute appeal in her husband’s eyes. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="670" height="22" font="2">“They say your friend Robert has fathered a dozen bastards himself.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“And none of them has ever been seen at court!” Ned blazed. “The Lannister </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">woman has seen to that. How can you be so damnably cruel, Catelyn? He is only a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">boy. He—” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His fury was on him. He might have said more, and worse, but Maester Luwin </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cut in. “Another solution presents itself,” he said, his voice quiet. “Your brother </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Benjen came to me about Jon a few days ago. It seems the boy aspires to take the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">black.” </text>
</page>
<page number="53" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="584" height="22" font="2">Ned looked shocked. “He asked to join the Night’s Watch?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn said nothing. Let Ned work it out in his own mind; her voice would </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not be welcome now. Yet gladly would she have kissed the maester just then. His </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was the perfect solution. Benjen Stark was a Sworn Brother. Jon would be a son to </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him, the child he would never have. And in time the boy would take the oath as </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">well. He would father no sons who might someday contest with Catelyn’s own </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">grandchildren for Winterfell. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="734" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin said, “There is great honor in service on the Wall, my lord.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And even a bastard may rise high in the Night’s Watch,” Ned reflected. Still, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">his voice was troubled. “Jon is so young. If he asked this when he was a man </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="560" height="22" font="2">grown, that would be one thing, but a boy of fourteen. . .” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A hard sacrifice,” Maester Luwin agreed. “Yet these are hard times, my lord. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">His road is no crueler than yours or your lady’s.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn thought of the three children she must lose. It was not easy keeping </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">silent then. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned turned away from them to gaze out the window, his long face silent and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">thoughtful. Finally he sighed, and turned back. “Very well,” he said to Maester </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="548" height="22" font="2">Luwin. “I suppose it is for the best. I will speak to Ben.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">“When shall we tell Jon?” the maester asked. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“When I must. Preparations must be made. It will be a fortnight before we are </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ready to depart. I would sooner let Jon enjoy these last few days. Summer will end </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">soon enough, and childhood as well. When the time comes, I will tell him myself.” </text>

<text top="290" left="187" width="686" height="22" font="2">She frowned down at them with dismay and glanced over to where </text>
<text top="318" left="133" width="746" height="22" font="2">her sister Sansa sat among the other girls. Sansa’s needlework was </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">exquisite. Everyone said so. “Sansa’s work is as pretty as she is,” Septa Mordane </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">told their lady mother once. “She has such fine, delicate hands.” When Lady </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had asked about Arya, the septa had sniffed. “Arya has the hands of a </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="128" height="22" font="2">blacksmith.” </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya glanced furtively across the room, worried that Septa Mordane might </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">have read her thoughts, but the septa was paying her no attention today. She was </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sitting with the Princess Myrcella, all smiles and admiration. It was not often that </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the septa was privileged to instruct a royal princess in the womanly arts, as she had </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said when the queen brought Myrcella to join them. Arya thought that Myrcella’s </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stitches looked a little crooked too, but you would never know it from the way </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane was cooing. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She studied her own work again, looking for some way to salvage it, then </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sighed and put down the needle. She looked glumly at her sister. Sansa was chatting </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">away happily as she worked. Beth Cassel, Ser Rodrik’s little girl, was sitting by her </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet, listening to every word she said, and Jeyne Poole was leaning over to whisper </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">something in her ear. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="513" height="22" font="2">“What are you talking about?” Arya asked suddenly. </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Jeyne gave her a startled look, then giggled. Sansa looked abashed. Beth </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">blushed. No one answered. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="212" height="22" font="2">“Tell me,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jeyne glanced over to make certain that Septa Mordane was not listening. </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Myrcella said something then, and the septa laughed along with the rest of the </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">ladies. </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="694" height="22" font="2">“We were talking about the prince,” Sansa said, her voice soft as a kiss. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya knew which prince she meant: Jofftey, of course. The tall, handsome </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">one. Sansa got to sit with him at the feast. Arya had to sit with the little fat one. </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">Naturally. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Joffrey likes your sister,” Jeyne whispered, proud as if she had something to </text>

<page number="55" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">do with it. She was the daughter of Winterfell’s steward and Sansa’s dearest friend. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">“He told her she was very beautiful.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He’s going to marry her,” little Beth said dreamily, hugging herself. “Then </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">Sansa will be queen of all the realm.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa had the grace to blush. She blushed prettily. She did everything prettily, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Arya thought with dull resentment. “Beth, you shouldn’t make up stories,” Sansa </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">corrected the younger girl, gently stroking her hair to take the harshness out of her </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">words. She looked at Arya. “What did you think of Prince Joff, sister? He’s very </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">gallant, don’t you think?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="403" height="22" font="2">“Jon says he looks like a girl,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa sighed as she stitched. “Poor Jon,” she said. “He gets jealous because </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">he’s a bastard.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He’s our brother,” Arya said, much too loudly. Her voice cut through the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="337" height="22" font="2">afternoon quiet of the tower room. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane raised her eyes. She had a bony face, sharp eyes, and a thin </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">lipless mouth made for frowning. It was frowning now. “What are you talking </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">about, children?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Our half brother,” Sansa corrected, soft and precise. She smiled for the septa. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Arya and I were remarking on how pleased we were to have the princess with us </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="165" height="22" font="2">today,” she said. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane nodded. “Indeed. A great honor for us all.” Princess Myrcella </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">smiled uncertainly at the compliment. “Arya, why aren’t you at work?” the septa </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">asked. She rose to her feet, starched skirts rustling as she started across the room. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">“Let me see your stitches.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya wanted to scream. It was just like Sansa to go and attract the septa’s </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">attention. “Here,” she said, surrendering up her work. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The septa examined the fabric. “Arya, Arya, Arya,” she said. “This will not </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">do. This will not do at all.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Everyone was looking at her. It was too much. Sansa was too well bred to </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smile at her sister’s disgrace, but Jeyne was smirking on her behalf. Even Princess </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Myrcella looked sorry for her. Arya felt tears filling her eyes. She pushed herself </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">out of her chair and bolted for the door. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane called after her. “Arya, come back here! Don’t you take </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">another step! Your lady mother will hear of this. In front of our royal princess too! </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="212" height="22" font="2">You’ll shame us all!” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Arya stopped  at the door and turned back, biting her lip. The tears were </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">running down her cheeks now. She managed a stiff little bow to Myrcella. “By your </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="163" height="22" font="2">leave, my lady.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Myrcella blinked at her and looked to her ladies for guidance. But if she was </text>

<page number="56" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">uncertain, Septa Mordane was not. “Just where do you think you are going, Arya?” </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">the septa demanded. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Arya glared at her. “I have to go shoe a horse,” she said sweetly, taking a brief </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">satisfaction in the shock on the septa’s face. Then she whirled and made her exit, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="555" height="22" font="2">running down the steps as fast as her feet would take her. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It wasn’t fair. Sansa had everything. Sansa was two years older; maybe by the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">time Arya had been born, there had been nothing left. Often it felt that way. Sansa </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">could sew and dance and sing. She wrote poetry. She knew how to dress. She </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">played the high harp <i>and</i> the bells. Worse, she was beautiful. Sansa had gotten their </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mother’s fine high cheekbones and the thick auburn hair of the Tullys. Arya took </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">after their lord father. Her hair was a lusterless brown,  and her face was long and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">solemn. Jeyne used to call her Arya Horseface, and neigh whenever she came near. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">It hurt that the one thing Arya could do better than her sister was ride a horse. Well, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that and manage a household. Sansa had never had much of a head for figures. If </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="759" height="22" font="2">she did marry Prince Joff, Arya hoped for his sake that he had a good steward. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Nymeria was waiting for her in the guardroom at the base of the stairs. She </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bounded to her feet as soon as she caught sight of Arya. Arya grinned. The wolf </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">pup loved her, even if no one else did. They went everywhere together, and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Nymeria slept in her room, at the foot of her bed. If Mother had not forbidden it, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Arya would gladly have taken the wolf with her to needlework. Let Septa Mordane </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="323" height="22" font="2">complain about her stitches <i>then</i>. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Nymeria nipped eagerly at her hand as Arya untied her. She had yellow eyes. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">When they caught the sunlight, they gleamed like two golden coins. Arya had </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">named her after the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, who had led her people across the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">narrow sea. That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“Lady.” Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="163" height="22" font="2">and she giggled. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. “Come,” she whispered to Nymeria. She got </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="739" height="22" font="2">Keep where you had a view of the whole yard. That was where they headed. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">drawn up languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down. </text>
</page>
<page number="57" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon gave her a curious look. “Shouldn’t you be working on your stitches, little </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="78" height="22" font="2">sister?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">Arya made a face at him. “I wanted to see them fight.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="301" height="22" font="2">He smiled. “Come here, then.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">grunts from the yard below. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">out encouragement, Robb’s voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the combatants were staggering. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">Arya judged that they had been at it awhile. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="580" height="22" font="2">“A shade more exhausting than needlework,” Jon observed. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A shade more fun than needlework,” Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Jon had their father’s face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a bastard too. It been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">her. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="521" height="22" font="2">“Why aren’t you down in the yard?” Arya asked him. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">He gave her a half smile. “Bastards are not allowed to damage young </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">princes,” he said. “Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="178" height="22" font="2">trueborn swords.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh.” Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="349" height="22" font="2">Arya reflected that life was not fair. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. “I could do just as good as </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="440" height="22" font="2">Bran,” she said. “He’s only seven. I’m nine.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. “You’re too </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">skinny,” he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">head. “I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="498" height="22" font="2">They watched Bran and Tommen circle each other. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="363" height="22" font="2">“You see Prince Joffrey?” Jon asked. </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="627" height="22" font="2">There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="480" height="22" font="2">“Look at the arms on his surcoat,” Jon suggested. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the prince’s padded </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">of Lannister. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The Lannisters are proud,” Jon observed. “You’d think the royal sigil would </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">be sufficient, but no. He makes his mother’s House equal in honor to the king’s.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">“The woman is important too!” Arya protested. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon chuckled. “Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">to Stark in your arms.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A wolf with a fish in its mouth?” It made her laugh. “That would look silly. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="644" height="22" font="2">Besides, if a girl can’t fight, why should she have a coat of arms?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon shrugged. “Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="530" height="22" font="2">but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the dust, trying to get up and failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="596" height="22" font="2">him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Enough!” Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and yanked him </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">back to his feet. “Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor.” He </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">looked around. “Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="761" height="22" font="2">Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. “Gladly.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodrik’s summons. His hair </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="790" height="22" font="2">shone like spun gold. He looked bored. “This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. “You are children,” he said </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">derisively. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Robb may be a child,” Joffrey said. “I am a prince. And I grow tired of </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">swatting at Starks with a play sword.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="702" height="22" font="2">“You got more swats than you gave, Joff,” Robb said. “Are you afraid?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Prince Joffrey looked at him. “Oh, terrified,” he said. “You’re so much older.” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="354" height="22" font="2">Some of the Lannister men laughed. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon looked down on the scene with a frown. “Joffrey is truly a little shit,” he </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">told Arya. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. “What are you </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">suggesting?” he asked the prince. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="127" height="22" font="2">“Live steel.” </text>
</page>
<page number="59" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="428" height="22" font="2">“Done,” Robb shot back. “You’ll be sorry!” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The master-at-arms put a hand on Robb’s shoulder to quiet him. “Live steel is </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="678" height="22" font="2">too dangerous. I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and burn scars on his face, pushed forward in front of the prince. “This is your </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="36" height="22" font="2">it.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Are you training women here?” the burned man wanted to know. He was </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="194" height="22" font="2">muscled like a bull. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I am training <i>knights</i>,” Ser Rodrik said pointedly. “They will have steel when </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="404" height="22" font="2">they are ready. When they are of an age.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="568" height="22" font="2">The burned man looked at Robb. “How old are you, boy?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="227" height="22" font="2">“Fourteen,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="711" height="22" font="2">“I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">Rodrik. “Let me do it. I can beat him.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="538" height="22" font="2">“Beat him with a tourney blade, then,” Ser Rodrik said. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Joffrey shrugged. “Come and see me when you’re older, Stark. If you’re not </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="518" height="22" font="4"><i>too</i> old.” There was laughter from the Lannister men. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb’s curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy seized Robb’s arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">his whiskers in dismay. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. “Come, Tommen,” </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="680" height="22" font="2">he said. “The hour of play is done. Leave the children to their frolics.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Rodrik’s face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="756" height="22" font="2">Robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“The show is done,” he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wolf rose and rubbed against him. “You had best run back to your room, little sister. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">You’ll  be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="692" height="22" font="2">your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Arya didn’t think it was funny. “I hate needlework!” she said with passion. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="143" height="22" font="2">“It’s not fair!” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Nothing is fair,” Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from her, Ghost moving silently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasn’t Septa Mordane waiting in her </text>

<text top="400" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was </text>

<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Night’s Watch. That was almost as good as </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="2">going south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to  ride the </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at King’s </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="80" height="22" font="2">swords. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Nan  said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one another’s swords </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the </text>

<text top="1063" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of </text>

<page number="62" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldn’t </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Bold, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">meet Ser Barristan when they reached King’s Landing, and Bran had been marking </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="376" height="22" font="2">begin a life he could scarcely imagine. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">been the only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his farewells today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Hodor,” the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">visit. . .  </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">its stall, except it wasn’t his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">smarter than any of the hounds in his father’s kennel and Bran would have sworn he </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">chasing sticks. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">because he ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jon’s wolf, the white one, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasn’t </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">right. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadn’t </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">might be his last chance. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">where the heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at his heels. “You stay here,” he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">howl. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yellow eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the wolf howled. “Quiet,” he yelled. “Sit down. Stay. You’re worse than Mother.” </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="283" height="22" font="2">armory roof and out of sight. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The rooftops of Winterfell were Bran’s second home. His mother often said </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that Bran could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">supposed it must be true. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldn’t even be sure what floor </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">all of Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="300" height="22" font="2">even Robb would never know. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">It taught him Winterfell’s secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out <i>on ground level</i> </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">Luwin didn’t know <i>that</i>, Bran was convinced. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">himself. He told her that he wouldn’t, but she never believed him. Once she made </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">him promise that he would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that </text>
</page>
<page number="64" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="612" height="22" font="2">the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to the godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">tallest sentinel in the grove. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. “You’re not my son,” </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he told Bran when they fetched him down, “you’re a squirrel. So be it. If you must </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="561" height="22" font="2">climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">father would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan  told him a story about a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">crows’ nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ate it right out of his hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="232" height="22" font="2">in pecking out his eyes. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Bran’s </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">happen to Bran if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">maester and said, “I’m not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">roofs, and try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">game with his brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">was almost like being invisible. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">toes digging hard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">them all. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">castle Bran’s secret place. </text>
</page>
<page number="65" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="641" height="22" font="2">the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The <i>best</i> way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">guards wouldn’t hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">climbing. You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">north side. From there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over to the broken tower where it leaned close. The last part was the scramble up </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then the crows would </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="440" height="22" font="2">come round to see if you’d brought any corn. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when he heard the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">had been empty all his life. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I do not like it,” a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him, and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. “<i>You </i>should be </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="110" height="22" font="2">the Hand.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Gods forbid,” a man’s voice replied lazily. “It’s not an honor I’d want. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">There’s far too much work involved.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">he tried to swing by. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Don’t you see the danger this puts us in?” the woman said. “Robert loves the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="198" height="22" font="2">man like a brother.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">be enough to give anyone indigestion.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Don’t play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">quite another. Robert will  <i>listen</i>  to Stark. Damn them both. I should have  <i>insisted</i> </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="589" height="22" font="2">that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refuse him.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We ought to count ourselves fortunate,” the man said. “The king might as </text>
</page>
<page number="66" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">easily have named one of his brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="803" height="22" font="2">honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and I’ll sleep more easily by night.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="740" height="22" font="2">more feet. . . but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="547" height="22" font="2">“We will have to watch him carefully,” the woman said. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I would sooner watch you,” the man said. He sounded bored. “Come back </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">here.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Neck,” the woman said. “Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">else would he leave the seat of his power?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the book of history, to get away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">warm for once in his life.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“His wife is Lady Arryn’s sister. It’s a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">with her accusations.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">inches wide. He tried to lower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="521" height="22" font="2">“You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">“That frightened cow shared Jon Arryn’s bed.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled King’s </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">Landing.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Rock? I think not. She knew the boy’s life would be hostage to her silence. She may </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">grow bolder now that he’s safe atop the Eyrie.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Mothers.” The man made the word sound like a curse. “I think birthing does </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">something to your minds. You are all mad.” He laughed. It was a bitter sound. “Let </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">she knows, she has no proof.” He paused a moment. “Or does she?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Do you think the king will require proof?” the woman said. “I tell you, he </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">loves me not.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="384" height="22" font="2">“And whose fault is that, sweet sister?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up. . . except that might make a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">noise, draw them to the window. He was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="283" height="22" font="2">it was not meant for his ears. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="518" height="22" font="2">“You are as blind as Robert,” the woman was saying. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“If you mean I see the same thing, yes,” the man said. “I see a man who would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">sooner die than betray his king.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten?” the woman said. “Oh, I </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">don’t deny he’s loyal to Robert, that’s obvious. What happens when Robert dies and </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="628" height="22" font="2">How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the way he had come, to find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who was talking. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The man sighed. “You should think less about the future and more about the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="188" height="22" font="2">pleasures at hand.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stop that!” the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="238" height="22" font="2">then the man’s laughter. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">This was the easy way. He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">the window of the room where they were talking. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister,” the man said. “Come here and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">be quiet.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">around, upside down. He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">toward the window. The world looked strange upside down. A courtyard swam </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="273" height="22" font="2">Bran looked in the window. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Bran could not tell who they were. The man’s back was to him, and his body </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="646" height="22" font="2">screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wide-eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">started to moan, low in her throat. “Stop it,” she said, “stop it, stop it. Oh, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>please</i> . . .” But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">down to her breast. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">he recognized the queen. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">right at him. She screamed. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Everything happened at once then. ‘ The woman pushed the man away wildly, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached </text>

<page number="68" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for the gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was an instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. He swung </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">against the building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangled, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">one-handed, panting. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="409" height="22" font="2">Faces appeared in the window above him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="360" height="22" font="2">much alike as reflections in a mirror. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="362" height="22" font="2">“He <i>saw</i> us,” the woman said shrilly. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="257" height="22" font="2">“So he did,” the man said. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Bran’s fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Fingernails dug into unyielding stone. The man reached down. “Take my hand,” he </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="229" height="22" font="2">said. “Before you fall.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">him up to the ledge. “What are you doing?” the woman demanded. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. “How </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">old are you, boy?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Seven,” Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">the man’s forearm. He let go sheepishly. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The man looked over at the woman. “The things I do for love,” he said with </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="313" height="22" font="2">loathing. He gave Bran a shove. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="581" height="22" font="2">nothing to grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">tower, waiting for corn. </text>

<text top="235" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>
<text top="262" left="114" width="759" height="22" font="2">omewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound </text>
<text top="290" left="114" width="432" height="22" font="2">hung over the castle like a flag of mourning. </text>
<text top="318" left="168" width="706" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">library was snug and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="223" height="22" font="2">naked before the pack. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on the book he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his hand. His </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">Lannister was not much a one for sleeping. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">His legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. “Chayle,” he said </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swinging wildly on its silver chain. “I’m off to break my fast. See that you return </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Valyrian scrolls, the parchment is very </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dry. Ayrmidon’s <i>Engines of War</i> is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">I’ve ever seen.” Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Clegane’s </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rasping voice drifted up to him. “The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">quicker about it.” </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">squires swarmed around them. “At least he dies quietly,” the prince replied. “It’s </text>

<page number="70" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="599" height="22" font="2">the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last night.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Clegane cast a long shadow across the hard-packed earth as his squire lowered </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the black helm over his head. “I could silence the creature, if it please you,” he said </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">through his open visor. His boy placed a longsword in his hand. He tested the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">weight of it, slicing at the cold morning air. Behind him, the yard rang to the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="240" height="22" font="2">clangor of steel on steel. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The notion seemed to delight the prince. “Send a dog to kill a dog!” he </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">exclaimed. “Winterfell is so infested with wolves, the Starks would never miss </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">one.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion hopped off the last step onto the yard. “I beg to differ, nephew,” he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">said. “The Starks can count past six. Unlike some princes I might name.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="370" height="22" font="2">Joffrey had the grace at least to blush. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A voice from nowhere,” Sandor said. He peered through his helm, looking </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">this way and that. “Spirits of the air!” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">The prince laughed, as he always laughed when his bodyguard did this </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="524" height="22" font="2">mummer’s farce. Tyrion was used to it. “Down here.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The tall man peered down at the ground, and pretended to notice him. “The </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">little lord Tyrion,” he said. “My pardons. I did not see you standing there.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I am in no mood for your insolence today.” Tyrion turned to his nephew. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Joffrey, it is past time you called on Lord Eddard and his lady, to offer them your </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">comfort.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Joffrey looked as petulant as only a boy prince can look. “What good will my </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">comfort do them?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“None,” Tyrion said. “Yet it is expected of you. Your absence has been </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">noted.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The Stark boy is nothing to me,” Joffrey said. “I cannot abide the wailing of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">women.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister reached up and slapped his nephew hard across the face. The </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">boy’s cheek began to redden. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="507" height="22" font="2">“One word,” Tyrion said, “and I will hit you again.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">“I’m going to tell Mother!” Joffrey exclaimed. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">Tyrion hit him again. Now both cheeks flamed. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You tell your mother,” Tyrion told him. “But first you get yourself to Lord </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Lady Stark, and you fall to your knees in front of them, and you tell them how </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">very sorry you are, and that you are at their service if there is the slightest thing you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">can do for them or theirs in this desperate hour, and that all your prayers go with </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">them. Do you understand? <i>Do you</i>?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The boy looked as though he was going to cry. Instead, he managed a weak </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nod. Then he turned and fled headlong from the yard, holding his cheek. Tyrion </text>
</page>
<page number="71" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">watched him run. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A shadow fell across his face. He turned to find Clegane looming overhead </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">like a cliff.  His soot-dark armor seemed to blot out the sun. He had lowered the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">visor on his helm. It was fashioned in the likeness of a snarling black hound, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fearsome to behold, but Tyrion had always thought it a great improvement over </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="326" height="22" font="2">Clegane’s hideously burned face. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The prince will remember that, little lord,” the Hound warned him. The helm </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">turned his laugh into a hollow rumble. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I pray he does,” Tyrion Lannister replied. “If he forgets, be a good dog and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remind him.” He glanced around the courtyard. “Do you know where I might find </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">my brother?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="309" height="22" font="2">“Breaking fast with the queen.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Ah,” Tyrion said. He gave Sandor Clegane a perfunctory nod and walked </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">away as briskly as his stunted legs would carry him, whistling. He pitied the first </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">knight to try the Hound today. The man did have a temper. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A cold, cheerless meal had been laid out in the morning room of the Guest </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">House. Jaime sat at table with Cersei and the children, talking in low, hushed </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">voices. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Is Robert still abed?” Tyrion asked as he seated himself, uninvited, at the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">table. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">His sister peered at him with the same expression of faint distaste she had </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">worn since the day he was born. “The king has not slept at all,” she told him. “He is </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="601" height="22" font="2">with Lord Eddard. He has taken their sorrow deeply to heart.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He has a large heart, our Robert,” Jaime said with a lazy smile. There was </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">very little that Jaime took seriously. Tyrion knew that about his brother, and forgave </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">it. During all the terrible long years of his childhood, only Jaime had ever shown </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him the smallest measure of affection or respect, and for that Tyrion was willing to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">forgive him most anything. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A servant approached. “Bread,” Tyrion told him, “and two of those little fish, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">until it turns black.” The man bowed and moved off. Tyrion turned back to his </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part this morning. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="770" height="22" font="2">fashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would rather not know. Bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="544" height="22" font="2">Another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="622" height="22" font="2">Prince Tommen spoke up. “Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I stopped by the sickroom last night,” Tyrion announced. “There was no </text>

<page number="72" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="484" height="22" font="2">change. The maester thought that a hopeful sign.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I don’t want Brandon to die,” Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Not like his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">pod themselves. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well,” Jaime mused. “One of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="688" height="22" font="2">the hostages murdered by Targaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely,” Tyrion said. The servant brought his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">plate. He ripped off a chunk of black bread. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">Cersei was studying him warily. “What do you mean?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion gave her a crooked smile. “Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="620" height="22" font="2">The maester thinks the boy may yet live.” He took a sip of beer. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the children Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lasted no more than a second, but he did not miss it. Then his sister dropped her </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gaze to the table. “That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to let the child </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">linger in such pain.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">“What were the maester’s words?” Jaime asked. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moment and said, “He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">so already. It has been four days with no change.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Will Bran get better, Uncle?” little Myrcella asked. She had all of her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">mother’s beauty, and none of her nature. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“His back is broken, little one,” Tyrion told her. “The fall shattered his legs as </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">well. They keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="808" height="22" font="2">Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="463" height="22" font="2">“If he wakes,” Cersei repeated. “Is that likely?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“The gods alone know,” Tyrion told her. “The maester only hopes.” He </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chewed some more bread. “I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The creature is outside his window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">stronger.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The queen shuddered. “There is something unnatural about those animals,” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">she said. “They are dangerous. I will <i>not</i> have any of them coming south with us.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jaime said, “You’ll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">girls everywhere.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="550" height="22" font="2">Tyrion started on his fish. “Are you leaving soon, then?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Not near soon enough,” Cersei said. Then she frowned. “Are we leaving?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">she echoed. “What about you? Gods, don’t tell me you are staying <i>here</i>?” </text>
</page>
<page number="73" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion shrugged. “Benjen Stark is returning to the Night’s Watch with his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brother’s bastard. I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">so much of.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jaime smiled. “I hope you’re not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">brother.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion laughed. “What, me, celibate? The whores would go begging from </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">edge of the world.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Cersei stood abruptly. “The children don’t need to hear this filth. Tommen, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Myrcella, come.” She strode briskly from the morning room, her train and her pups </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">trailing behind her. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">death.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He will if Robert commands it,” Tyrion said. “And Robert <i>will</i> command it. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="601" height="22" font="2">There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He could end his torment,” Jaime said. “I would, if it were my son. It would </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="128" height="22" font="2">be a mercy.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother,” </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">Tyrion said. “He would not take it kindly.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Even if the boy does live, he  will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">grotesque. Give me a good clean death.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Speaking for the grotesques,” he said, “I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">while life is full of possibilities.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="560" height="22" font="2">Jaime smiled. “You are a perverse little imp, aren’t you?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Oh, yes,” Tyrion admitted. “I hope the boy does wake. I would be most </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">interested to hear what he might have to say.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">His brother’s smile curdled like sour milk. “Tyrion, my sweet brother,” he </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said darkly, “there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="47" height="22" font="2">on.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">beer to wash it all down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, “Why, Jaime, my sweet </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">brother,” he said, “you wound me. You know how much I love my family.” </text>

<text top="290" left="97" width="774" height="22" font="2">ever. Ghost padded silently beside him. Outside, snow swirled through the </text>
<text top="318" left="97" width="777" height="22" font="2">castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="580" height="22" font="2">walls it was still warm and quiet. Too quiet for Jon’s liking. </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">his hand. He took courage from that. He straightened, and entered the room. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">close on a fortnight. Not for a moment had she left Bran’s side. She had her meals </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">though it was said she had scarcely slept at all. She fed him herself, the honey and </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">water and herb mixture that sustained life. Not once did she leave the room. So Jon </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">had stayed away. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="325" height="22" font="2">But now there was no more time. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. The </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="721" height="22" font="2">window was open. Below, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Lady Stark looked over. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Finally she blinked. “What are <i>you</i> doing here?” she asked in a voice strangely flat </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">and emotionless. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="496" height="22" font="2">“I came to see Bran,” Jon said. “To say good-bye.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Her face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">looked as though she had aged twenty years. “You’ve said it. Now go away.” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">Bran again. He took a nervous step into the room. “Please,” he said. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Something cold moved in her eyes. “I told you to leave,” she said. “We don’t </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">want you here.” </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him </text>

<text top="1090" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Call them,” Jon said, defiant. “You can’t stop me from seeing him.” He </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">he lay. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the Bran </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">he remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick. His </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. The fall had </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">carry him off to his grave. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">each shallow breath. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Bran,” he said, “I’m sorry I didn’t come before. I was afraid.” He could feel </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the tears rolling down his cheeks. Jon no longer cared. “Don’t die, Bran. Please. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">We’re all waiting for you to wake up. Me and Robb and the girls, everyone. . .” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Lady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">acceptance. Outside the window, the direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">not had time to name. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I have to go now,” Jon said. “Uncle Benjen is waiting. I’m to go north to the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Wall. We have to leave today, before the snows come.” He remembered how </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey. It was more than he could </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his tears, leaned </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="584" height="22" font="2">“I wanted him to stay here with me,” Lady Stark said softly. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at him. She was talking to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="702" height="22" font="2">him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I prayed for it,” she said dully. “He was my special boy. I went to the sept </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="616" height="22" font="2">and leave him here with me. Sometimes prayers are answered.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon did not know what to say. “It wasn’t your fault,” he managed after an </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">awkward silence. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Her eyes found him. They were full of poison. “I need none  of your </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="204" height="22" font="2">absolution, bastard.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Bran’s hands. He took the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">other, squeezed it. Fingers like the bones of birds. “Good-bye,” he said. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He was at the door when she called out to him. “Jon,” she said. He should </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have kept going, but she had never called him by his name before. He turned to find </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="618" height="22" font="2">her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="155" height="22" font="2">“Yes?” he said. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It should have been you,” she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">before. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="356" height="22" font="2">It was a long walk down to the yard. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Outside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being loaded, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">men were shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">stables. A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">seemed to have grown of late, as if Bran’s fall and his mother’s collapse had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="555" height="22" font="2">somehow made him stronger. Grey Wind was at his side. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Uncle Benjen is looking for you,” he told Jon. “He wanted to be gone an </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">hour ago.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I know,” Jon said. “Soon.” He looked around at all the noise and confusion. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="342" height="22" font="2">“Leaving is harder than I thought.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“For me too,” Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="256" height="22" font="2">body. “Did you see him?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="407" height="22" font="2">Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="465" height="22" font="2">“He’s not going to die,” Robb said. “I know it.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You Starks are hard to kill,” Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">visit had taken all the strength from him. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="503" height="22" font="2">Robb knew something was wrong. “My mother. . .” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="372" height="22" font="2">“She was. . . very kind,” Jon told him. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb looked relieved. “Good.” He smiled. “The next time I see you, you’ll be </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">all in black.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon forced himself to smile back. “It was always my color. How long do you </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="168" height="22" font="2">think it will be?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Soon enough,” Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">fiercely. “Farewell, Snow.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="580" height="22" font="2">Jon hugged him back. “And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I will.” They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. “Uncle Benjen </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="606" height="22" font="2">said to send you to the stables if I saw you,” Robb finally said. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="488" height="22" font="2">“I have one more farewell to make,” Jon told him. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Then I haven’t seen you,” Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">armory. He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she was. Nymeria was helping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="772" height="22" font="2">But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">skinny  arms tight around his neck. “I was afraid you were gone,” she said, her </text>
</page>
<page number="77" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">breath catching in her throat. “They wouldn’t let me out to say good-bye.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="414" height="22" font="2">“What did you do now?” Jon was amused. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face. “Nothing. I was all </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">packed and everything.” She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room. “Septa Mordane says I have </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to do it all over. My things weren’t properly folded, she says. A proper southron </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">lady doesn’t just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="341" height="22" font="2">“Is that what you did, little sister?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Well, they’re going to get all messed up anyway,” she said. “Who cares how </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="163" height="22" font="2">they’re folded?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Septa Mordane,” Jon told her. “I don’t think she’d like Nymeria helping, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">either.” The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes. “It’s just as </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">well. I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="108" height="22" font="2">carefully.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="280" height="22" font="2">Her face lit up. “A present?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="388" height="22" font="2">“You could call it that. Close the door.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Wary but excited, Arya checked the hall. “Nymeria, here. Guard.” She left the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door. By then Jon had pulled off </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">the rags he’d wrapped it in. He held it out to her. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Arya’s eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. “A sword,” she said in a small, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">hushed breath. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel. “This is no toy,” he told </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="808" height="22" font="2">her. “Be careful you don’t cut yourself. The edges are sharp enough to shave with.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="303" height="22" font="2">“Girls don’t shave,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="575" height="22" font="2">“Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septa’s legs?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="355" height="22" font="2">She giggled at him. “It’s so skinny.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“So are you,” Jon told her. “I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It won’t hack a man’s </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="628" height="22" font="2">head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you’re fast enough.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="255" height="22" font="2">“I can be fast,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You’ll have to work at it every day.” He put the sword in her hands, showed </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="801" height="22" font="2">her how to hold it, and stepped back. “How does it feel? Do you like the balance?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="229" height="22" font="2">“I think so,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="562" height="22" font="2">“First lesson,” Jon said. “Stick them with the pointy end.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya gave him a <i>whap</i> on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot. “I know which end to use,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">A doubtful look crossed her face. “Septa Mordane will take it away from me.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="467" height="22" font="2">“Not if she doesn’t know you have it,” Jon said. </text>

<page number="78" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="273" height="22" font="2">“Who will I practice with?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You’ll find someone,” Jon promised her. “King’s Landing is a true city, a </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thousand times the size of Winterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">in the yard. Run, and ride, make yourself strong. And whatever you do. . .” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="549" height="22" font="2">Arya knew what was coming next. They said it together. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="282" height="22" font="2">“. . . <i>don’t</i>. . . <i>tell</i>. . . <i>Sansa!</i>” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="521" height="22" font="2">Jon messed up her hair. “I will miss you, little sister.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry. “I wish you were coming with </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="44" height="22" font="2">us.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows?” He was </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">feeling better now. He was not going to let himself be sad. “I better go. I’ll spend </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">longer.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya ran to him for a last  hug. “Put down the sword first,” Jon warned her, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="713" height="22" font="2">balance. “I almost forgot,” he told her. “All the best swords have names.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Like Ice,” she said. She looked at the blade in her hand. “Does this have a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">name? Oh, tell me.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="571" height="22" font="2">“Can’t you guess?” Jon teased. “Your very favorite thing.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. She was that quick. They </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">said it together: </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="102" height="22" font="2">“<i>Needle!</i>” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="623" height="22" font="2">The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north. </text>

<text top="731" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not </text>

<text top="787" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="2">glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. “So long as he pays the price.” </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. “I </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“I counsel you to be patient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but </text>

<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. “You woke the dragon,” he </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">screamed as he kicked her. “You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon.” Her </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there was a hideous <i>ripping</i> sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">found hers, she  woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She had </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">never been so afraid. . .  </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">. . . until the day of her wedding came at last. </text>

<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">drinking and feasting and fighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grass palaces, and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and frightening. The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mare’s milk and Illyrio’s </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">in Dany’s ears. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scarlet dragon on the chest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of high honor, just below the <i>khal</i>’s own bloodriders, but Dany could see the anger </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in her brother’s lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the slaves offered each dish first to the <i>khal</i> and his bride, and served him from the </text>

<page number="81" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">portions they refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="683" height="22" font="2">did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the kitchens of Pentos, but she waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">knew she could keep none of it down. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">There was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him. They had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the <i>khal</i> knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">hear her. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">talking silently to herself. <i>I am blood of the dragon</i>, she told herself.<i> I am Daenerys </i></text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="4"><i>Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="4"><i>Conqueror</i>. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the <i>khal</i>. Drogo watched </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. “The </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a <i>khalasar</i>, and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="459" height="22" font="2">they do not understand sin or shame as we do.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">way to avert her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the  <i>arakhs</i>  were out, long razor-sharp </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="626" height="22" font="2">shrieking insults at each clash. No one made a move to interfere. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It ended as quickly as it began. The <i>arakhs</i> shivered together faster than Dany </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel </text>

<page number="82" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bit into flesh just above the Dothraki’s waist, and opened him from backbone to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hold of the nearest woman—not even the one they had been quarreling over—and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="747" height="22" font="2">had her there and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. “A Dothraki wedding </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,” he had said. Her wedding must </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="750" height="22" font="2">have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">to scream. She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">bronze mask. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="503" height="22" font="4"><i>I am the blood of the dragon</i>, she told herself again. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. Drogo </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thought aside, but it would not leave her. She hugged herself to try to keep from </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">shaking. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">cost him nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped  eyes, Doreah a fair-</text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. “These are no common servants, sweet sister,” her </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. “Illyrio and I selected </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them personally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love.” He smiled thinly. “She’s </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. “It is a small thing, my princess, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">but all a poor exile could afford,” he said as he laid a small stack of old books </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">before her. They were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce. . . and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned </text>
</page>
<page number="83" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. “What are they?” she </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Dragon’s eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai,” said Magister </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">Illyrio. “The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I shall treasure them always.” Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The <i>khal</i>’s bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">weapons they were. Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Cohollo a magnificent  <i>arakh</i>  chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the traditional refusals for these offerings. “This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">O blood of my blood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="556" height="22" font="2">stead.” And so Khal Drogo too received his “bride gifts.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">made from the skin of a thousand mice. “A handsome gift,  <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Magister </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. “Most lucky.” The gifts </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">more gifts than she could want or use. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">until it had swallowed the whole  <i>khalasar</i>.  When he returned, the dense press of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">horses to know that this was no  ordinary animal. There was something about her </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that took the breath away. She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">smoke. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horse’s neck, ran her fingers </text>
</page>
<page number="84" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">through the silver of her mane. Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio translated. “Silver for the silver of your hair, the <i>khal</i> says.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="348" height="22" font="2">“She’s beautiful,” Dany murmured. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“She is the pride of the  <i>khalasar</i>,  “Illyrio said. “Custom decrees that the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="4"><i>khaleesi</i> must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the <i>khal</i>.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">easily as if she were a child and set her on the thin Dothraki saddle, so much </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smaller than the ones she was used to. Dany sat there uncertain for a moment. No </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="685" height="22" font="2">one had told her about this part. “What should I do?” she asked Illyrio. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. “Take the reins and ride. You need </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="116" height="22" font="2">not go far.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stirrups. She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wagon and palanquin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall off and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="182" height="22" font="2">the first time ever. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">parted for her, every eye upon them. Dany found herself moving faster than she had </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">trot, and she smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest pressure with </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">jumped out of her way. As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop. A daring </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="721" height="22" font="2">she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="513" height="22" font="2">The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, “Tell Khal Drogo that </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he has given me the wind.” The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="761" height="22" font="2">her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">then. Dany had lost all track of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. As the  <i>khal</i>  was saddling the horse, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="154" height="22" font="2">woken before.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The fear came back to her then, with her brother’s words. She felt like a child </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">her. </text>

<page number="85" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the  <i>khalasar</i>  and the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grass palaces behind. Khal Drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">softly as he rode. “I am the blood of the dragon,” she whispered aloud as she </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">followed, trying to keep her courage up. “I am the blood of the dragon. I am the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="498" height="22" font="2">blood of the dragon.” The dragon was never afraid. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">off his horse and lifted her down from hers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">cry. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. “No,” </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">he said. He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">thumb. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="557" height="22" font="2">“You speak the Common Tongue,” Dany said in wonder. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="200" height="22" font="2">“No,” he said again. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she had known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="553" height="22" font="2">tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">into his eyes. Drogo towered over her as he towered  over everyone. Taking her </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">finally at a height. “No,” he said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="486" height="22" font="2">“Is that the only word you know?” she asked him. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Drogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward to help. When they were done, Drogo </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="707" height="22" font="2">gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen hair so long, so black, so thick. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="447" height="22" font="2">Then it was his turn. He began to undress her. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">small breasts, she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself </text>
</page>
<page number="86" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">with her hands. “No,” Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. “No,” he </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">repeated. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="298" height="22" font="2">“No,” she echoed back at him. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. The </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">and legs. She was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">with his eyes. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">After a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sense the fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">own and brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a hand gently down her leg. He </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">around, massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thumbs, pinched them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="700" height="22" font="2">and looked into his eyes. “No?” he said, and she knew it was a question. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="517" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” she whispered as she put his finger inside her. </text>

<text top="373" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. “Up, </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="627" height="22" font="2">Stark!” he roared. “Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss.” </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“By all means,” Ned said. “Come inside, Your Grace.” Alyn lifted the flap of </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">the tent. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No, no, <i>no</i>,” Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. “The camp is </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">full of ears. Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours.” Ser Boros </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="646" height="22" font="2">nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beside him, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blew his words away, and the king did not hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">Robert would not slow. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">then they were miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Ned reined up beside him. “Gods,” he swore, laughing, “it feels good to get out and </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>ride</i> the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to drive a man mad.” He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. “That </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I do, I do,” the king said. “What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Would that we could,” Ned said, “but we have duties now, my liege. . . to the </text>

<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you could drown in them. Yours was. . .   Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Her name was Wylla,” Ned replied with cool courtesy, “and I would sooner </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="177" height="22" font="2">not speak of her.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Wylla. Yes.” The king grinned. “She must have been a rare wench if she </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told </text>

<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned’s mouth tightened in anger. “Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you say you bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="470" height="22" font="2">“Gods have mercy, you scarcely <i>knew</i> Catelyn.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="518" height="22" font="2">“I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">Robert frowned. “Have we ridden onto a graveyard?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace,” Ned told him. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="182" height="22" font="2">“This land is old.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“And cold,” Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. “Well, I did </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">“Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Would that I might forget him,” Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">king’s justice. Five years had passed since then. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">him to return from exile,” Robert explained. “Lord Varys makes good use of him.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So the slaver has become a spy,” Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">back. “I would rather he become a corpse.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses,” Robert said. “Jorah </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">aside, what do you make of his report?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">send her a wedding gift?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The king frowned. “A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">wield it.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned did not feign surprise; Robert’s hatred of the Targaryens was a madness </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in him. He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar’s wife and children as a token of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fealty. Ned had named that murder; Robert called it war. When he had protested </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">replied, “I see no babes. Only dragonspawn.” Not even Jon Arryn had been able to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the last battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">them; Lyanna’s death, and the grief they had shared over her passing. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. “Your Grace, the girl is scarcely </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">more than a child. You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.” It was said </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">that Rhaegar’s little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin’s </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">soldiers had torn him from his mother’s breast and dashed his head against a wall. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And how long will this one remain an innocent?” Robert’s mouth grew hard. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“This <i>child</i> will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">to plague me.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="779" height="22" font="2">“Nonetheless,” Ned said, “the murder of children. . . it would be </text>
</page>
<page number="90" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">vile. . . unspeakable. . .” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>Unspeakable?</i>” the king roared. “What Aerys did to your brother Brandon </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">was unspeakable. The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable. And </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Rhaegar. . . how many times do you think he raped your sister? How many </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>hundreds</i> of times?” His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">angry finger at Ned. “I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">are as dead as their dragons, and then I will piss on their graves.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not quenched Robert’s thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. “You can’t </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="519" height="22" font="2">get your hands on this one, can you?” he said quietly. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">The king’s mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. “No, gods be cursed. Some pox-</text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now he’s handed them over to the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="622" height="22" font="2">them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">“Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. “This </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="126" height="22" font="2">say to that?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea,” Ned replied calmly. “The </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="575" height="22" font="2">barbarians have no <i>ships</i>. They hate and fear the open sea.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. “Perhaps. There are ships to be </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had in the Free Cities, though. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If  the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He will not cross,” Ned promised. “And if by some mischance he does, we </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="2">will throw him back into the sea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East—” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The king groaned. “For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="784" height="22" font="2">would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned was ready for that. “Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Robert Arryn will not do, name one of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">siege of Storm’s End, surely.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">He looked uncomfortable. </text>
</page>
<page number="91" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That is,” Ned finished quietly, watching, “unless you have already promised </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">the honor to another.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">became annoyance. “What if I have?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="313" height="22" font="2">“It’s Jaime Lannister, is it not?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the barrows. Ned kept pace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. “Yes,” </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="507" height="22" font="2">he said at last. A single hard word to end the matter. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Kingslayer,” Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ground now, he knew. “An able and courageous man, no doubt,” he said carefully, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">honor. No one man should hold both East and West.” He left unsaid  his real </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="138" height="22" font="2">of Lannisters. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field,” the king said </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stubbornly. “At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. Don’t vex me about this, Ned, the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">stone has been set.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="354" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace, may I speak frankly?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I seem unable to stop you,” Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">grasses. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="326" height="22" font="2">“Can you trust Jaime Lannister?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He is my wife’s twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="294" height="22" font="2">and honor all bound to mine.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="602" height="22" font="2">“As they were bound to Aerys Targaryen’s,” Ned pointed out. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">him. His sword helped win the throne I sit on.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>His sword helped taint the throne you sit on</i>, Ned thought, but he did not </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">permit the words to pass his lips. “He swore a vow to protect his king’s life with his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">own. Then he opened that king’s throat with a sword.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Seven hells, <i>someone</i> had to kill Aerys!” Robert said, reining his mount to a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. “If Jaime hadn’t done it, it would have been </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="192" height="22" font="2">left for you or me.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard,” Ned said. The time had </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">come for Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. “Do you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="361" height="22" font="2">remember the Trident, Your Grace?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="475" height="22" font="2">“I won my crown there. How should I forget it?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“You took a wound from Rhaegar,” Ned reminded him. “So when the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of </text>
</page>
<page number="92" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Rhaegar’s army fled back to King’s Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="765" height="22" font="2">Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert gave an impatient shake of his head. “Instead you found that our men </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">had already taken the city. What of it?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Not our men,” Ned said patiently. “Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="804" height="22" font="2">over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The war had raged for close  to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Robert’s banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had remained aloof from the struggle, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">appeared before the gates of King’s Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">professing loyalty. So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">city to the lions at the gate. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well,” Robert said. The anger was </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">building in him again. “Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="450" height="22" font="2">deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You were not there,” Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled sleep was no </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="444" height="22" font="2">night. “There was no honor in that conquest.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Others take your honor!” Robert swore. “What did any Targaryen ever </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">know of honor? Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragon’s </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">honor!” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You avenged Lyanna at the Trident,” Ned said, halting beside the king. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="4"><i>Promise me, Ned</i>, she had whispered. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That did not bring her back.” Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“The gods be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown. . . it was the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>girl</i> I prayed them for. Your sister, safe. . . and mine again, as she was meant to be. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">kings and cowherds alike.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace. . . only for what I found when I </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">rode into the throne room that day,” Ned said. “Aerys was dead on the floor, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lannister’s men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">shape of a lion’s head. How he glittered!” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="424" height="22" font="2">“This is well known,” the king complained. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long </text>

<page number="93" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">

<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, its </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">edge red with a king’s blood. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister’s </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">‘Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It’s not a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="347" height="22" font="2">very comfortable seat, I’m afraid.’” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">moments?” He shook with laughter again. “Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="178" height="22" font="2">more than a boy.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="437" height="22" font="2">“Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps he was tired,” Robert suggested. “Killing kings is weary work. Gods </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">know, there’s no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">truly, it  <i>is</i>  a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one.” The king </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">shook his head. “Well, now I know Jaime’s dark sin, and the matter can be </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned. It’s </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all as tedious as counting coppers. Come, let’s ride, you used to know how. I want </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">to feel the wind in my hair again.” He kicked his horse back into motion and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">For a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with a vast sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">doing here and why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="490" height="22" font="2">belonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">A man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="568" height="22" font="2">Stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king. </text>

<text top="373" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queen’s huge </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="464" height="22" font="2">turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="481" height="22" font="2">It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">their stony summits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">were rude inns to be found. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-</text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders. When the wind </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">banners. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">With the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">through the wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. “The wolfswood,” Benjen Stark called it, </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">distant. Jon Snow’s albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">never raised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">animal, Tyrion thought. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with two of his own men, as befit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">nephew and some fresh mounts for the Night’s Watch, but at the edge of the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and sinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">peasant boys from the Fingers. “Rapers,” Yoren said with a cold look at his charges. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no doubt it was </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">preferable to castration. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Five men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">over to Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="297" height="22" font="2">for the kingsroad, or any road. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard were  matted and greasy and full of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="516" height="22" font="2">even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Night’s Watch </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was made up of men like his uncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had chosen a hard life. . . or perhaps he </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="501" height="22" font="2">should say that a hard life had been chosen for him. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother’s distaste for Lannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him of his intentions. “I warn you, Lannister, you’ll find no inns at the Wall,” he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">had said, looking down on him. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No doubt you’ll find some place to put me,” Tyrion had replied. “As you </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">might have noticed, I’m small.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">One did not say no to the queen’s brother, of course, so that had settled the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">matter, but Stark had not been happy. “You will not like the ride, I promise you </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">that,” he’d said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">to live up to that promise. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By the end of the first week, Tyrion’s thighs were raw from hard riding, his </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">legs were cramping badly, and he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="582" height="22" font="2">was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to him in an excess of Night’s Watch </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously decline. Tyrion had accepted with a </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">up here, and growing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="177" height="22" font="2">what was offered. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="632" height="22" font="2">shelter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hobbled, too in-the-way. So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="400" height="22" font="2">a wineskin and go off by himself to read. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark’s permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="518" height="22" font="2">Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="757" height="22" font="2">He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-</text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dragonbone.  <i>Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content</i>,  the book told </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">him.<i>  It  is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly </i></text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small </i></text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="588" height="22" font="4"><i>wonder. An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow</i>. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">King’s Landing for his sister’s wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryen’s throne </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">room. King Robert had replaced them  with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="776" height="22" font="2">persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">not thought to find them beautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. They liked the fire, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he sensed. He’d thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">knives of black diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bathed in the heat of far greater fires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">sworn that the beast’s empty eye sockets had watched him go. </text>
</page>
<page number="97" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">There were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">old; the youngest a mere century and a half. The most recent were also the smallest; </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">a matched pair no bigger than mastiff’s skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the last of the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given them the names of gods: </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar’s gullet, although you </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would not have ridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even </text>

<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">conquest. That was close on three hundred years ago, when the Seven Kingdoms </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>were</i> kingdoms, and not mere provinces of a greater realm. Between them, the Two </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Kings had six hundred banners flying, five thousand mounted knights, and ten times </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">as many freeriders and men-at-arms. Aegon Dragonlord had perhaps a fifth that </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">number, the chroniclers said, and most of those were conscripts from the ranks of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="489" height="22" font="2">the last king he had slain, their loyalties uncertain. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The hosts met on the broad plains of the Reach, amidst golden fields of wheat </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ripe for harvest. When the Two Kings charged, the Targaryen army shivered and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shattered and began to run. For a few moments, the chroniclers wrote, the conquest </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was at an end. . . but only for those few moments, before Aegon Targaryen and his </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">sisters joined the battle. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">It was the only time that Vhaghar, Meraxes, and Balerion were all unleashed </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">at once. The singers called it the Field of Fire. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Near four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Reach. King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="750" height="22" font="2">fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="291" height="22" font="2">“Why do you read so much?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, “Look at </text>
</page>
<page number="98" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">me and tell me what you see.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The boy looked at him suspiciously. “Is this some kind of trick? I see you. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion sighed. “You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="247" height="22" font="2">“Fourteen,” the boy said. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Fourteen, and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">me to some slaver’s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that very same king, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my House, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my mind. . . and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">its edge.” Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. “That’s why I read so much, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">long, solemn, guarded, a face that gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">been, she had left little of herself in her son. “What are you reading about?” he </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">asked. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="279" height="22" font="2">“Dragons,” Tyrion told him. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“What good is that? There are no more dragons,” the boy said with the easy </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">certainty of youth. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“So they say,” Tyrion replied. “Sad, isn’t it? When I was your age, used to </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">dream of having a dragon of my own.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You did?” the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">fun of him. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">world when he’s seated on a dragon’s back.” Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">climbed to his feet. “I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes I’d imagine my </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">father burning. At other times, my sister.” Jon Snow was staring at him, a look </text>
</page>
<page number="99" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. “Don’t look at me that way, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="680" height="22" font="2">bastard. I know your secret. You’ve dreamt the same kind of dreams.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="467" height="22" font="2">“No,” Jon Snow said, horrified. “I wouldn’t. . .” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No? Never?” Tyrion raised an eyebrow. “Well, no doubt the Starks have </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been terribly good to you. I’m certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">her own. And your brother Robb, he’s always been kind, and why not? He gets </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father. . . he must have good reasons for </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">packing you off to the Night’s Watch. . .” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Stop it,” Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. “The Night’s Watch is a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">noble calling!” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion laughed. “You’re too smart to believe that. The Night’s Watch is a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">midden heap for all the misfits of the realm. I’ve seen you looking at Yoren and his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them? Sullen </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">warned you about. The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so it’s scarcely </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since you’re not </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="542" height="22" font="2">allowed to breed anyway, I don’t suppose that matters.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>Stop it!</i>” the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">fists, close to tears. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Suddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ground, the book spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his teeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="490" height="22" font="2">“Help me,” he said to the boy, reaching up a hand. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">And suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thing never made a sound. He only looked at him with those bright red eyes, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. Tyrion sagged back to the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="745" height="22" font="2">ground with a grunt. “Don’t help me, then. I’ll sit right here until you leave.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="714" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow stroked Ghost’s thick white fur, smiling now. “Ask me nicely.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">will. It was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated, and it would not be </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. “I should be very grateful for your kind </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="312" height="22" font="2">assistance, Jon,” he said mildly. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Down, Ghost,” the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red </text>
</page>
<page number="100" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes never left Tyrion. Jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="775" height="22" font="2">and lifted him easily to his feet. Then he picked up the book and handed it back. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Why did he attack me?” Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="406" height="22" font="2">“Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. “Oh, gods,” </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he said, choking on his laughter and shaking his head, “I suppose I do rather look </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="432" height="22" font="2">like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You don’t want to know.” Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">Tyrion. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his mouth. The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="537" height="22" font="2">belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. “Want some?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. “It’s true, isn’t it?” he said </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">when he was done. “What you said about the Night’s Watch.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="154" height="22" font="2">Tyrion nodded. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="737" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. “If that’s what it is, that’s what it is.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion grinned at him. “That’s good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="229" height="22" font="2">hard truth than face it.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">“Most men,” the boy said. “But not you.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No,” Tyrion admitted, “not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">There are no dragons.” He scooped up the fallen bearskin. “Come, we had better </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="504" height="22" font="2">return to camp before your uncle calls the banners.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cramping badly by the time they got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him off. He would make his own way, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters had been </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">against the wind. The horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stone, skinning a squirrel. The savory smell of stew filled Tyrion’s nostrils. He </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. “More </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">pepper,” he said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. “There you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">are. Jon, damn it, don’t go off like that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">you.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It was the grumkins,” Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">a baffled look at Yoren. The old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his </text>
</page>
<page number="101" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">bloody work. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hard cheese that night around their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">even Yoren grew mellow. One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="635" height="22" font="2">to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the night’s first watch. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="548" height="22" font="2">fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="459" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed. </text>

<text top="428" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin,” she told him, never taking her </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="683" height="22" font="2">eyes from Bran. “I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away.” </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My lady, the king’s party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="102" height="22" font="2">before—” </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She cut him off. “I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">needs.” </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We have no steward,” Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">thought, he would not let go. “Poole  went south to establish Lord Eddard’s </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">household at King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Catelyn nodded absently. “Oh, yes. I remember.” Bran looked so pale. She </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">morning sun. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“There are several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jory’s place, a new </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">master of horse—” </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her eyes snapped around and found him. “A master of <i>horse</i>?” Her voice was </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">a whip. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The maester was shaken. “Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="62" height="22" font="2">so—” </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">master of <i>horse</i>? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my </text>

<text top="1090" left="108" width="587" height="22" font="2">He bowed his head. “Yes, my lady, but the appointments—” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="400" height="22" font="2">“I’ll make the appointments,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her. She had been shouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="640" height="22" font="2">happening to her? She was so tired, and her head hurt all the time. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. “I have prepared a  list of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices,” he said, offering Robb a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="300" height="22" font="2">paper plucked from his sleeve. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Her son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cheeks were red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown.  “Good men,” he </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">said. “We’ll talk about them tomorrow.” He handed back the list of names. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="566" height="22" font="2">“Very good, my lord.” The paper vanished into his sleeve. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Leave us now,” Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the door behind him and turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. “Mother, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="212" height="22" font="2">what are you doing?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa, he had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face, something as stern and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hard as the north. “What am I doing?” she echoed, puzzled. “How can you ask that? </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">What do you imagine I’m doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">of Bran.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Is that what you call it? You haven’t left this room since Bran was hurt. You </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="656" height="22" font="2">didn’t even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">window.” She had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">everything had changed now, couldn’t he see that? It was no use. He had no choice, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he had told her, and then he left, choosing. “I can’t leave him, even for a moment, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not when any moment could be his last. I have to be with him, if. . . if. . .” She took </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her son’s limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own. He was so frail and thin, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="86" height="22" font="2">his skin. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robb’s voice softened. “He’s not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">the time of greatest danger has passed.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and I’m not </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">here?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“<i>Rickon  </i>needs you,” Robb said sharply. “He’s only three, he doesn’t </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">understand what’s happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I don’t know what to do with him.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way he’d done when he was </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">little. “Mother, <i>I</i> need you too. I’m trying but I can’t. . . I can’t do it all by myself.” </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fourteen. She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="240" height="22" font="2">and she could not move. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="745" height="22" font="2">Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Bran’s.” Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">room. The howling grew louder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="122" height="22" font="2">and despair. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="491" height="22" font="2">“Don’t,” she told him. “Bran needs to stay warm.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He needs to hear them sing,” Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first. Then a third, closer. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Shaggydog and Grey Wind,” Robb said as their voices rose and fell together. “You </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">can tell them apart if you listen close.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. “Make </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them stop!” she cried. “I can’t stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">all if you must, just make them <i>stop</i>!” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She didn’t remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lifting her, holding her in strong arms. “Don’t be afraid, Mother. They would never </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hurt him.” He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom. “Close </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">your eyes,” he said gently. “Rest. Maester Luwin tells me you’ve hardly slept since </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">Bran’s fall.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I <i>can’t</i>,” she wept. “Gods forgive me, Robb, I can’t, what if he dies while I’m </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies. . .”  The wolves were still howling. She </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="632" height="22" font="2">screamed and held her ears again. “Oh, gods, close the window!” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“If you swear to me you’ll sleep.” Robb went to the window, but as he </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">direwolves. “Dogs,” he said, listening. “All the dogs are barking. They’ve never </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">done that before. . .” Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she looked </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">up, his face was pale in the lamplight. “<i>Fire</i>,” he whispered. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>Fire</i>,  she thought, and then,  <i>Bran</i>!  “Help me,” she said urgently, sitting up. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">“Help me with Bran.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="669" height="22" font="2">Robb did not seem to hear her. “The library tower’s on fire,” he said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She sagged with relief. Bran was safe. The library was across the bailey, there was </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">no way the fire would reach them here. “Thank the gods,” she whispered. </text>
</page>
<page number="105" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb looked at her as if she’d gone mad. “Mother, stay here. I’ll come back as </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soon as the fire’s out.” He ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">room, heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">at a time. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Outside, there were shouts of “Fire!” in the yard, screams, running footsteps, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the whinny of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony. The direwolves </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="165" height="22" font="2">had fallen silent. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the window. Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="696" height="22" font="2">the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the shutters. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="737" height="22" font="2">When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You weren’t s’posed to be here,” he muttered sourly. “No one was s’posed to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">be here.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. He </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">was a dagger in his hand. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. “No,” she said. The word stuck in </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="298" height="22" font="2">her throat, the merest whisper. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="674" height="22" font="2">He must have heard her. “It’s a mercy,” he said. “He’s dead already.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No,” Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. “No, you <i>can’t</i>.” </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">She spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">than she would have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The stench of him </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="194" height="22" font="2">was overwhelming. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pulling it away from her throat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were slippery with blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her head to the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">into his palm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">him, and all of a sudden he let go. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, breathing </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="606" height="22" font="2">blood. “You weren’t s’posed to be here,” he repeated stupidly. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a </text>
</page>
<page number="106" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">something, because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap. They went </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where she’d fallen. The wolf had him </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">under the jaw. The man’s shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">back its head, taking out half his throat. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="565" height="22" font="2">His blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">golden in the dark room. It was Bran’s wolf, she realized. Of course it was. “Thank </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you,” Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny. She lifted her hand, trembling. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">rough tongue. When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">silently and jumped up on Bran’s bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">laugh hysterically. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That was the way they found them, when Robb  and Maester Luwin and Ser </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Rodrik burst in with half the guards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to her own chambers. Old Nan  undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="500" height="22" font="2">bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in her fingers </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where he’d </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pulled out a handful of hair. The maester told her the pain was just starting now, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="476" height="22" font="2">and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="271" height="22" font="2">Finally she closed her eyes. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">When she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Catelyn nodded and sat up in bed. It all seemed like a  nightmare to her now, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">everything since Bran’s fall, a terrible dream of blood and grief, but she had the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="563" height="22" font="2">strangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Bring me some bread and honey,” she told her servants, “and take word to </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing.” They looked at her in surprise </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="254" height="22" font="2">and ran to do her bidding. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had let them all down, her children, her husband, her House. It would not happen </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="798" height="22" font="2">again. She would show these northerners how strong a Tully of Riverrun could be. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Robb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">husband’s ward Theon Greyjoy, and  lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a square brown beard. He was the new captain of the guard, Robb said. Her </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at his </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">waist. </text>

<page number="107" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="358" height="22" font="2">“Who was he?” Catelyn asked them. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“No one knows his name,” Hallis Mollen told her. “He was no man of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, m’lady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">few weeks.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“One of the king’s men, then,” she said, “or one of the Lannisters’. He could </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">have waited behind when the others left.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Maybe,” Hal said. “With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">there’s no way of saying who he belonged to.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“He’d been hiding in your stables,” Greyjoy said. “You could smell it on </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">him.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="511" height="22" font="2">“And how could he go unnoticed?” she said sharply. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Hallis Mollen looked abashed. “Between the horses Lord Eddard took south </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and them we sent north to the Night’s Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">great trick to hide from the stableboys. Could be Hodor saw him, the talk is that </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">boy’s been acting queer, but simple as he is. . .” Hal shook his head. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“We found where he’d been sleeping,” Robb put in. “He had ninety silver </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="748" height="22" font="2">“It’s good to know my son’s life was not sold cheaply,” Catelyn said bitterly. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Hallis Mollen looked at her, confused. “Begging your grace, m’lady, you </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">saying he was out to kill your <i>boy</i>?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy was doubtful. “That’s madness.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He came for Bran,” Catelyn said. “He kept muttering how I wasn’t supposed </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to be there. He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="744" height="22" font="2">guards with me. If I hadn’t been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Why would anyone want to kill Bran?” Robb said. “Gods, he’s only a little </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">boy, helpless, sleeping. . .” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. “If you are to rule in the north, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you must think these things through, Robb. Answer your own question. Why would </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">anyone want to kill a sleeping child?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Before he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the kitchen. There was much more than she’d asked for: hot bread, butter and honey </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and blackberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="575" height="22" font="2">cheese, a pot of mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“How is my son, Maester?” Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="118" height="22" font="2">no appetite. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="557" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin lowered his eyes. “Unchanged, my lady.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">It was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with pain, as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">and looked back to Robb. “Do you have the answer yet?” </text>
</page>
<page number="108" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Someone is afraid Bran might wake up,” Robb said, “afraid of what he might </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">say or do, afraid of something he knows.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn was proud of him. “Very good.” She turned to the new captain of the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="770" height="22" font="2">guard. “We must keep Bran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="526" height="22" font="2">“How many guards do you want, m’lady?” Hal asked. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell,” she told </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robb stood a little taller.  “Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">warrant or my mother’s.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="217" height="22" font="2">“As you say, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="317" height="22" font="2">“Do it now,” Catelyn suggested. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="569" height="22" font="2">“And let his wolf stay in the room with him,” Robb added. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="432" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Catelyn said. And then again: “Yes.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="385" height="22" font="2">Hallis Mollen bowed and left the room. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Lady Stark,” Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, “did you chance </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">to notice the dagger the killer used?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="646" height="22" font="2">for its edge,” Catelyn replied with a dry smile. “Why do you ask?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We found the knife still in the villain’s grasp. It seemed to me that it was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked at it long and hard. The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. A weapon like that has no business </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">being in the hands of such as him. Someone gave it to him.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="507" height="22" font="2">Catelyn nodded, thoughtful. “Robb, close the door.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="495" height="22" font="2">He looked at her strangely, but did as she told him. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“What I am about to tell you must not leave this room,” she told them. “I want </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">your oaths on that. If even part of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="752" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard is a second father to me,” said Theon Greyjoy. “I do so swear.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="412" height="22" font="2">“You have my oath,” Maester Luwin said. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="409" height="22" font="2">“And mine, my lady,” echoed Ser Rodrik. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="404" height="22" font="2">She looked at her son. “And you, Robb?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="230" height="22" font="2">He nodded his consent. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband,  Lord Arryn, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Hand of the King,” Catelyn told them. “It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not join the hunt the day Bran fell. He remained here in the castle.” The room was </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">deathly quiet. “I do not think Bran fell from that tower,” she said into the stillness. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">“I think he was thrown.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The shock was plain on their faces. “My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion,” </text>
</page>
<page number="109" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said Rodrik Cassel. “Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">child.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">“Oh, would he?” Theon Greyjoy asked. “I wonder.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="715" height="22" font="2">“There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition,” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“The boy had always been surehanded in the past,” Maester Luwin said </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="495" height="22" font="2">thoughtfully. “He knew every stone in Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Gods</i>,” Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. “If this is true, he will </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">pay for it.” He drew his sword and waved it in the air. “I’ll kill him myself!” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik bristled at him. “Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leagues away. <i>Never</i> draw your sword unless you mean to use it. How many times </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">must I tell you, foolish boy?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Abashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn said to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik, “I see my son is wearing steel now.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="513" height="22" font="2">The old master-at-arms said, “I thought it was time.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robb was looking at her anxiously. “Past time,” she said. “Winterfell may </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="717" height="22" font="2">have need of all its swords soon, and they had best not be made of wood.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, “My lady, if it </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. “All </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">we have is conjecture. This is the queen’s beloved brother we mean to accuse. She </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="653" height="22" font="2">will not take it kindly. We must have proof, or forever keep silent.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your proof is in the dagger,” Ser Rodrik said. “A fine blade like that will not </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">have gone unnoticed.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized. “Someone </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">must go to King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="201" height="22" font="2">“I’ll go,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No,” she told him. “Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Winterfell.”  She looked at Ser Rodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous. Who to </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">send? Who would be believed? Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push back the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone. She climbed out of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="242" height="22" font="2">bed. “I must go myself.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“My lady,” said Maester Luwin, “is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">greet your arrival with suspicion.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“What about Bran?” Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">“You can’t mean to leave him.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I have done everything I can for Bran,” she said, laying a wounded hand on </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his arm. “His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="565" height="22" font="2">me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="523" height="22" font="2">“You will need a strong escort, my lady,” Theon said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="527" height="22" font="2">“I’ll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” Catelyn said. “A large party attracts unwelcome attention. I would not </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="396" height="22" font="2">have the Lannisters know I am coming.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik protested. “My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">can be perilous for a woman alone.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“I will not be taking the kingsroad,” Catelyn replied. She thought for a </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moment, then nodded her consent. “Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses. I will </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us </text>

<text top="290" left="122" width="750" height="22" font="2">broke their fast. “The king sent for him. Another hunt, I do believe. There </text>
<text top="318" left="122" width="458" height="22" font="2">are still wild aurochs in these lands, I am told.” </text>
<text top="345" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’ve never seen an aurochs,” Sansa said, feeding a piece of bacon to Lady </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">under the table. The direwolf took it from her hand, as delicate as a queen. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane sniffed in disapproval. “A noble lady does not feed dogs at her </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">table,” she said, breaking off another piece of comb and letting the honey drip down </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">onto her bread. </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“She’s not a dog, she’s a direwolf,” Sansa pointed out as Lady licked her </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fingers with a rough tongue. “Anyway, Father said we could keep them with us if </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">we want.” </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The septa was not appeased. “You’re a good girl, Sansa, but I do vow, when it </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">comes to that creature you’re as willful as your sister Arya.” She scowled. “And </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="290" height="22" font="2">where is Arya this morning?” </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“She wasn’t hungry,” Sansa said, knowing full well  that her sister had </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">probably stolen down to the kitchen hours ago and wheedled a breakfast out of </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="175" height="22" font="2">some cook’s boy. </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Do remind her to dress nicely today. The grey velvet, perhaps. We are all </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">invited to ride with the queen and Princess Myrcella in the royal wheelhouse, and </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">we must look our best.” </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa already looked her best. She had brushed out her long auburn hair until </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it shone, and picked her nicest blue silks. She had been looking forward to today for </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">more than a week. It was a great honor to ride with the queen, and besides, Prince </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Joffrey might be there. Her betrothed. Just thinking it made her feel a strange </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fluttering inside, even though they were not to marry for years and years. Sansa did </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not really  <i>know</i>  Joffrey yet, but she was already in love with him. He was all she </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ever dreamt her prince should be, tall and handsome and strong, with hair like gold. </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">She treasured every chance to spend time with him, few as they were. The only </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thing that scared her about today was Arya. Arya had a way of ruining everything. </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">You never knew what she would do. “I’ll tell her,” Sansa said uncertainly, “but </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she’ll dress the way she always does.” She hoped it wouldn’t be too embarrassing. </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You may.” Septa Mordane helped herself to more bread and honey, and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Sansa slid from the bench. Lady followed at her heels as she ran from the inn’s </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Outside, she stood for a moment amidst the shouts and curses and the creak of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">wooden wheels as the men broke down the tents and pavilions and loaded the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wagons for another day’s march. The inn was a sprawling three-story structure of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pale stone, the biggest that Sansa had ever seen, but even so, it had accommodations </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">for less than a third of the king’s party, which had swollen to more than four </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">hundred with the addition of her father’s household and the freeriders who had </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="240" height="22" font="2">joined them on the road. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She found Arya on the banks of the Trident, trying to hold Nymeria still while </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">she brushed dried mud from her fur. The direwolf was not enjoying the process. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Arya was  wearing the same riding leathers she had worn yesterday and the day </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">before. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You better put on something pretty,” Sansa told her. “Septa Mordane said so. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="721" height="22" font="2">We’re traveling in the queen’s wheelhouse with Princess Myrcella today.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’m not,” Arya said, trying  to brush a tangle out of Nymeria’s matted grey </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="745" height="22" font="2">fur. “Mycah and I are going to ride upstream and look for rubies at the ford.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="414" height="22" font="2">“Rubies,” Sansa said, lost. “What rubies?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya gave her a look like she was so stupid. “<i>Rhaegar’s </i>rubies. This is where </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">King Robert killed him and won the crown.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Sansa regarded her scrawny little sister in disbelief. “You can’t look for </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="617" height="22" font="2">rubies, the princess is expecting us. The queen invited us both.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I don’t care,” Arya said. “The wheelhouse doesn’t even have <i>windows</i>, you </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="179" height="22" font="2">can’t see a thing.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What could you want to see?” Sansa said, annoyed. She had been thrilled by </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the invitation, and her stupid sister was going to ruin everything, just as she’d </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="502" height="22" font="2">feared. “It’s all just fields and farms and holdfasts.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="757" height="22" font="2">“It is <i>not</i>,” Arya said stubbornly. “If you came with us sometimes, you’d see.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I <i>hate</i> riding,” Sansa said fervently. “All it does is get you soiled and dusty </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">and sore.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya shrugged. “Hold <i>still</i>,” she snapped at Nymeria, “I’m not hurting you.” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Then to Sansa she said, “When we were crossing the Neck, I counted thirty-six </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="635" height="22" font="2">flowers I never saw before, and Mycah showed me a lizard-lion.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sansa shuddered. They had been twelve days crossing the Neck, rumbling </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down a crooked causeway through an endless black bog, and she had hated every </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">moment of it. The air had been damp and clammy, the causeway so narrow they </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could not even make proper camp at night, they had to stop right on the kingsroad. </text>

<page number="113" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dense thickets of half-drowned trees pressed close around them, branches dripping </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with curtains of pale fungus. Huge flowers bloomed in the mud and floated on pools </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of stagnant water, but if you were stupid enough to leave the causeway to pluck </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them, there were quicksands waiting to suck you down, and snakes watching from </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the trees, and lizard-lions floating half-submerged in the water, like black logs with </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">eyes and teeth. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">None of which stopped Arya, of course. One day she came back grinning her </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">horsey grin, her hair all tangled and her clothes covered in mud, clutching a raggedy </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bunch of purple and green flowers for Father. Sansa kept hoping he would tell Arya </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to behave herself and act like the highborn lady she was supposed to be, but he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">never did, he only hugged her and thanked her for the flowers. That just made her </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">worse. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Then it turned out the purple flowers were called <i>poison kisses</i>, and Arya got a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">rash on her arms. Sansa would have thought that might have taught her a lesson, but </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Arya laughed about it, and the next day she rubbed mud all over her arms like some </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">ignorant bog woman just because her friend Mycah told her it would stop the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">itching. She had bruises on her arms and shoulders too, dark purple welts and faded </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">green-and-yellow splotches, Sansa had seen them when her sister undressed for </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="575" height="22" font="2">sleep. How she had gotten <i>those</i> only the seven gods knew. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya was still going on, brushing out Nymeria’s tangles and chattering about </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">things she’d seen on the trek south. “Last week we found this haunted watchtower, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and the day before we chased a herd of wild horses. You should have seen them run </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when they caught a scent of Nymeria.” The wolf wriggled in her grasp and Arya </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="680" height="22" font="2">scolded her. “Stop that, I have to do the other side, you’re all muddy.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You’re not supposed to leave the column,” Sansa reminded her. “Father said </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="44" height="22" font="2">so.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Arya shrugged. “I didn’t go far. Anyway, Nymeria was with me the whole </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">time. I don’t always go off, either. Sometimes it’s fun just to ride along with the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">wagons and talk to people.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Sansa knew all about the sorts of people Arya liked to talk to: squires and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grooms and serving girls, old men and naked children, rough-spoken freeriders of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">uncertain birth. Arya would make friends with <i>anybody</i>. This Mycah was the worst; </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a butcher’s boy, thirteen and wild, he slept in the meat wagon and smelled of the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slaughtering block. Just the sight of him was enough to make Sansa feel sick, but </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">Arya seemed to prefer his company to hers. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa was running out of patience now. “You have to come with me,” she told </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">her sister firmly. “You can’t refuse the queen. Septa Mordane will expect you.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya ignored her. She gave a hard yank with the brush. Nymeria growled and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">spun away, affronted. “Come <i>back</i> here!” </text>
</page>
<page number="114" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“There’s going to be lemon cakes and tea,” Sansa went on, all adult and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">reasonable. Lady brushed against her leg. Sansa scratched her ears the way she </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">liked, and Lady sat beside her on her haunches, watching Arya chase Nymeria. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Why would you want to ride a smelly old horse and get all sore and sweaty when </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="654" height="22" font="2">you could recline on feather pillows and eat cakes with the queen?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I don’t like the queen,” Arya said casually. Sansa sucked in her breath, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shocked that even <i>Arya</i> would say such a thing, but her sister prattled on, heedless. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“She won’t even let me bring Nymeria.” She thrust the brush under her belt and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="547" height="22" font="2">stalked her wolf. Nymeria watched her approach warily. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“A royal wheelhouse is no place for a  <i>wolf</i>,” Sansa said. “And Princess </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="422" height="22" font="2">Myrcella is afraid of them, you know that.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Myrcella is a little baby.” Arya grabbed Nymeria around her neck, but the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moment she pulled out the brush again the direwolf wriggled free and bounded off. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="633" height="22" font="2">Frustrated, Arya threw down the brush. “<i>Bad </i>wolf!” she shouted. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa couldn’t help but smile a little. The kennelmaster once told her that an </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">animal takes after its master. She gave Lady a quick little hug. Lady licked her </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cheek. Sansa giggled.  Arya heard and whirled around, glaring. “I don’t care what </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">you say, I’m going out riding.” Her long horsey face got the stubborn look that </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="443" height="22" font="2">meant she was going to do something willful. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Gods be true, Arya, sometimes you act like such a <i>child</i>,” Sansa said. “I’ll go </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">by myself then. It will be ever so much nicer that way. Lady and I will eat all the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="525" height="22" font="2">lemon cakes and just have the best time without you.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She turned to walk off, but Arya shouted after her, “They won’t let you bring </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lady either.” She was gone before Sansa could think of a reply, chasing Nymeria </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="152" height="22" font="2">along the river. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Alone and humiliated, Sansa took the long way back to the inn, where she </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knew Septa Mordane would be waiting. Lady padded quietly by her side. She was </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">almost in tears. All she wanted was for  things to be nice and pretty, the way they </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were in the songs. Why couldn’t Arya be sweet and delicate and kind, like Princess </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">Myrcella? She would have liked a sister like that. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sansa could never understand how two sisters, born only two years apart, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">could  be so different. It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their half brother Jon. She even <i>looked</i> like Jon, with the long face and brown hair </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her coloring. And </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Jon’s mother had been <i>common</i>, or so people whispered. Once, when she was littler, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Sansa had even asked Mother if perhaps there hadn’t been some mistake. Perhaps </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the grumkins had stolen her <i>real</i> sister. But Mother had only laughed and said no, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Arya was her daughter and Sansa’s trueborn sister, blood of their blood. Sansa </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could not think why Mother would want to lie about it, so she supposed it had to be </text>

<page number="115" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">true. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As she neared the center of camp, her distress was quickly forgotten. A crowd </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had gathered around the queen’s wheelhouse. Sansa heard excited voices buzzing </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">like a hive of bees. The doors had been thrown open, she saw, and the queen stood </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">at the top of the wooden steps, smiling down at someone. She heard her saying, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">“The council does us great honor, my good lords.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="495" height="22" font="2">“What’s happening?” she asked a squire she knew. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The council sent riders from King’s Landing to escort us the rest of the way,” </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="418" height="22" font="2">he told her. “An honor guard for the king.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Anxious to see, Sansa let Lady clear a path through the crowd. People moved </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">aside  hastily for the direwolf. When she got closer, she saw two knights kneeling </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="682" height="22" font="2">before the queen, in armor so fine and gorgeous that it made her blink. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">One knight wore an intricate suit of white enameled scales, brilliant as a field </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of new-fallen snow, with silver chasings and clasps that glittered in the sun. When </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he removed his helm, Sansa saw that he was an old man with hair as pale as his </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">armor, yet he seemed strong and graceful for all that. From his shoulders hung the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="351" height="22" font="2">pure white cloak of the Kingsguard. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His companion was a man near twenty whose armor was steel plate of a deep </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">forest-green. He was the handsomest man Sansa had ever set eyes upon; tall and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">powerfully made, with jet-black hair that fell to his shoulders and framed a clean-</text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shaven face, and laughing green eyes to match his armor. Cradled under one arm </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="612" height="22" font="2">was an antlered helm, its magnificent rack shimmering in gold. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">At first Sansa did not notice the third stranger. He did not kneel with the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">others. He stood to one side, beside their horses, a gaunt grim man who watched the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">proceedings in silence. His face was pockmarked and beardless, with deepset eyes </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and hollow cheeks. Though he was not an old man, only a few wisps of hair </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">remained to him, sprouting above his ears, but those he had grown long as a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">woman’s. His armor was iron-grey chainmail over layers of boiled leather, plain </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and unadorned, and it spoke of age and hard use. Above his right shoulder the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stained leather hilt of the blade strapped to his back was visible; a two-handed </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">greatsword, too long to be worn at his side. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The king is gone hunting, but I know he will be pleased to see you when he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">returns,” the queen was saying to the two knights who knelt before her, but Sansa </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could not take her eyes off the third man. He seemed to feel the weight of her gaze. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Slowly he turned his head. Lady growled. A terror as overwhelming as anything </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa Stark had ever felt filled her suddenly. She stepped backward and bumped </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">into someone. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Strong hands grasped her by the shoulders, and for a moment Sansa thought it </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was her father, but when she turned, it was the burned face of Sandor Clegane </text>

<page number="116" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looking down at her, his mouth twisted in a terrible mockery of a smile. “You are </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">shaking, girl,” he said, his voice rasping. “Do I frighten you so much?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He did, and had since she had first laid eyes on the ruin that fire had made of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his face, though it seemed to her now that he was not half so terrifying as the other. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Still, Sansa wrenched away from him, and the Hound laughed, and Lady moved </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">between them, rumbling a warning. Sansa dropped to her knees to wrap her arms </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around the wolf. They were all gathered around gaping, she could feel their eyes on </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">her, and here and there she heard muttered comments and titters of laughter. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A wolf,” a man said, and someone else said, “Seven hells, that’s a direwolf,” </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the first man said, “What’s it doing in camp?” and the Hound’s rasping voice </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">replied, “The Starks use them for wet nurses,” and Sansa realized that the two </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stranger knights were looking down on her and Lady, swords in their hands, and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="641" height="22" font="2">then she was frightened again, and ashamed. Tears filled her eyes. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="443" height="22" font="2">She heard the queen say, “Joffrey, go to her.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="253" height="22" font="2">And her prince was there. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Leave her alone,” Joffrey said. He stood over her, beautiful in blue wool and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">black leather, his golden curls shining in the sun like a crown. He gave her his hand, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">drew her to her feet. “What is it, sweet lady? Why are you afraid? No one will hurt </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you. Put away your swords, all of you. The wolf is her little pet, that’s all.” He </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">looked at Sandor Clegane. “And you, dog, away with you, you’re scaring my </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">betrothed.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The Hound, ever faithful, bowed and slid away quietly through the press. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Sansa struggled to steady herself. She felt like such a fool. She was a Stark of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, a noble lady, and someday she would be a queen. “It was not him, my </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="561" height="22" font="2">sweet prince,” she tried to explain. “It was the other one.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The two stranger knights exchanged a look. “Payne?” chuckled the young </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">man in the green armor. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The older man in white spoke to Sansa gently. “Ofttimes Ser Ilyn frightens me </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">as well, sweet lady. He has a fearsome aspect.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“As well he should.” The queen had descended from the wheelhouse. The </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">spectators parted to make way for her. “If the wicked do not fear the King’s Justice, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">you have put the wrong man in the office.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa finally found her words. “Then surely you have chosen the right one, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="661" height="22" font="2">Your Grace,” she said, and a gale of laughter erupted all around her. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Well spoken, child,” said the old man in white. “As befits the daughter of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark. I am honored to know you, however irregular the manner of our </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="650" height="22" font="2">meeting. I am Ser Barristan Selmy, of the Kingsguard.” He bowed. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa knew the name, and now the courtesies that Septa Mordane had taught </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her over the years came back to her. “The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard,” </text>

<page number="117" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">she said, “and councillor to Robert our king and to Aerys Targaryen before him. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The honor is mine, good knight. Even in the far north, the singers praise the deeds </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">of Barristan the Bold.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The green knight laughed again. “Barristan the Old, you mean. Don’t flatter </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him too sweetly, child, he thinks overmuch of himself already.” He smiled at her. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Now, wolf girl, if you can put a name to me as well, then I must concede that you </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="307" height="22" font="2">are truly our Hand’s daughter.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="721" height="22" font="2">Joffrey stiffened beside her. “Have a care how you address my betrothed.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I can answer,” Sansa said quickly, to quell her prince’s anger. She smiled at </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the green knight. “Your helmet bears golden antlers, my lord. The stag is the sigil of </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the royal House. King Robert has two brothers. By your extreme youth, you can </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">only be Renly Baratheon, Lord of Storm’s End and councillor to the king, and so I </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">name you.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan chuckled. “By his extreme youth, he can only be a prancing </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">jackanapes, and so <i>I</i> name him.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was general laughter, led by Lord Renly himself. The tension of a few </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moments ago was gone, and Sansa was beginning to feel comfortable. . . until Ser </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ilyn Payne shouldered two men aside, and stood before her, unsmiling. He did not </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">say a word. Lady bared her teeth and began to growl, a low rumble full of menace, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but this time Sansa silenced the wolf with a gentle hand to the head. “I am sorry if I </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">offended you, Ser Ilyn,” she said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She waited for an answer, but none came. As the headsman looked at her, his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pale colorless eyes seemed to strip the clothes away from her, and then the skin, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">leaving her soul naked before him. Still silent, he turned and walked away. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sansa did not understand. She looked at her prince. “Did I say something </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="506" height="22" font="2">wrong, Your Grace? Why will he not speak to me?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Ilyn has not been feeling talkative these past fourteen years,” Lord Renly </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">commented with a sly smile. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Joffrey gave his uncle a look of pure loathing, then took Sansa’s hands in his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">own. “Aerys Targaryen had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“He speaks  most eloquently with his sword, however,” the queen said, “and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his devotion to our realm is unquestioned.” Then she smiled graciously and said, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Sansa, the good councillors and I must speak together until the king returns with </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">your father. I fear we shall  have to postpone your day with Myrcella. Please give </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">your sweet sister my apologies. Joffrey, perhaps you would be so kind as to </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">entertain our guest today.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It would be my pleasure, Mother,” Joffrey said very formally. He took her by </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the arm and led her away from the wheelhouse, and Sansa’s spirits took flight. A </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whole day with her prince! She gazed at Joffrey worshipfully. He was so gallant, </text>

<page number="118" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she thought. The way he had rescued her from Ser Ilyn and the Hound, why, it was </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">almost like the songs, like the time Serwyn of the Mirror Shield saved the Princess </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Daeryssa from the giants, or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight championing Queen </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="488" height="22" font="2">Naerys’s honor against evil Ser Morgil’s slanders. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The touch of Joffrey’s hand on her sleeve made her heart beat faster. “What </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">would you like to do?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>Be with you</i>, Sansa thought, but she said, “Whatever you’d like to do, my </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">prince.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="489" height="22" font="2">Jofftey reflected a moment. “We could go riding.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="305" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I <i>love</i> riding,” Sansa said. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Joffrey glanced back at Lady, who was following at their heels. “Your wolf is </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">liable to frighten the horses, and my dog seems to frighten you. Let us leave them </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="533" height="22" font="2">both behind and set off on our own, what do you say?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa hesitated. “If you like,” she said uncertainly. “I suppose I could tie Lady </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">up.” She did not quite understand, though. “I didn’t know you had a dog. . .” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Joffrey laughed. “He’s my mother’s dog, in truth. She has set him to guard </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">me, and so he does.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You mean the Hound,” she said. She wanted to hit herself for being so slow. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Her prince would never love her if she seemed stupid. “Is it safe to leave him </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">behind?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Prince Joffrey looked annoyed that she would even ask. “Have no fear, lady. I </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">am almost a man grown, and I don’t fight with wood like your brothers. All I need </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is this.” He drew his sword and showed it to her; a longsword adroitly shrunken to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">suit a boy of twelve, gleaming blue steel, castle-forged and double-edged, with a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leather grip and a lion’s-head pommel in gold. Sansa exclaimed over it admiringly, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">and Joffrey looked pleased. “I call it Lion’s Tooth,” he said. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">And so they left her direwolf and his bodyguard behind them, while they </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ranged east along the north bank of the Trident with no company save Lion’s Tooth. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">It was a glorious day, a magical day. The air was warm and heavy with the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scent of flowers, and the woods here had a gentle beauty that Sansa had never seen </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the north. Prince Joffrey’s mount was a blood bay courser, swift as the wind, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he rode it with reckless abandon, so fast that Sansa was hard-pressed to keep up on </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her mare. It was a day for adventures. They explored the caves by the riverbank, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and tracked a shadowcat to its lair, and when they grew hungry, Joffrey found a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">holdfast by its smoke and told them to fetch food and wine for their prince and his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lady. They dined on trout fresh from the river, and Sansa drank more wine than she </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had ever drunk before. “My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,” </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="272" height="22" font="2">she confessed to her prince. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,” Joffrey said, refilling her cup. </text>
</page>
<page number="119" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as they rode, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">his voice high and sweet and pure. Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">“Shouldn’t we be starting back?” she asked. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Soon,” Joffrey said. “The battleground is right up ahead, where the river </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bends. That was where my father killed Rhaegar Targaryen, you know. He smashed </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">in his chest,  <i>crunch</i>,  right through the armor.” Joffrey swung an imaginary </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">warhammer to show her how it was done. “Then my uncle Jaime killed old Aerys, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">and my father was king. What’s that sound?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa heard it too, floating through the woods, a kind of wooden clattering, </text>

<text top="335" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">let’s go back.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I want to see what it is.” Joffrey turned his horse in the direction of the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sounds, and Sansa had no choice but to follow. The noises grew louder and more </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">distinct, the clack of wood on wood, and as they grew closer they heard heavy </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">breathing as well, and now and then a grunt. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Someone’s there,” Sansa said anxiously. She found herself thinking of Lady, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">wishing the direwolf was with her. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You’re safe with me.” Joffrey drew his Lion’s Tooth from its sheath. The </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sound of steel on leather made her tremble. “This way,” he said, riding through a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="140" height="22" font="2">stand of trees. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Beyond, in a clearing overlooking the river, they came upon a boy and a girl </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">playing at knights. Their swords were wooden sticks, broom handles from the look </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of them, and they were rushing across the grass, swinging at each other lustily. The </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">boy was years older, a head taller, and much stronger, and he was pressing the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">attack. The girl, a scrawny thing in soiled leathers, was dodging and managing to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">get her stick in the way of most of the boy’s blows, but not all. When she tried to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lunge at him, he caught her  stick with his own, swept it aside, and slid his wood </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">down hard on her fingers. She cried out and lost her weapon. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Prince Joffrey laughed. The boy looked around, wide-eyed and startled, and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dropped his stick in the grass. The girl glared at them, sucking on her knuckles to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">take the sting out, and Sansa was horrified. “<i>Arya?</i>” she called out incredulously. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Go away,” Arya shouted back at them, angry tears in her eyes. “What are </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">you doing here? Leave us alone.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Joffrey glanced from Arya to Sansa and back again. “Your sister?” She </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nodded, blushing. Joffrey examined the boy, an ungainly lad with a coarse, freckled </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">face and thick red hair. “And who are you, boy?” he asked in a commanding tone </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="633" height="22" font="2">that took no notice of the fact that the other was a year his senior. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Mycah,” the boy muttered. He recognized the prince and averted his eyes. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">“M’lord.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="364" height="22" font="2">“He’s the butcher’s boy,” Sansa said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="593" height="22" font="2">“He’s my friend,” Arya said sharply. “You leave him alone.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A butcher’s boy who wants to be a knight, is it?” Joffrey swung down from </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his mount, sword in hand. “Pick up your sword, butcher’s boy,” he said, his eyes </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">bright with amusement. “Let us see how good you are.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="356" height="22" font="2">Mycah stood there, frozen with fear. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Joffrey walked toward him. “Go on, pick it up. Or do you only fight little </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">girls?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="526" height="22" font="2">“She ast me to, m’lord,” Mycah said. “She <i>ast</i> me to.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa had only to glance at Arya and see the flush on her sister’s face to know </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the boy was telling the truth, but Joffrey was in no mood to listen. The wine had </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">made him wild. “Are you going to pick up your sword?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Mycah shook his head. “It’s only a stick, m’lord. It’s not no sword, it’s only a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">stick.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And you’re only a butcher’s boy, and no knight.” Joffrey lifted Lion’s Tooth </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and laid its point on Mycah’s cheek below the eye, as the butcher’s boy stood </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">trembling. “That was my lady’s sister you were hitting, do you know that?” A </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bright bud of blood blossomed where his sword pressed into Mycah’s flesh, and a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">slow red line trickled down the boy’s cheek. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="564" height="22" font="2">“<i>Stop it!</i>” Arya screamed. She grabbed up her fallen stick. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="451" height="22" font="2">Sansa was afraid. “Arya, you stay out of this.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I won’t hurt him. . . much,” Prince Joffrey told Arya, never taking his eyes </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">off the butcher’s boy. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="190" height="22" font="2">Arya went for him. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa slid off her mare, but she was too slow. Arya swung with both hands. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">There was a loud <i>crack</i> as the wood split against the back of the prince’s head, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">then everything happened at once before Sansa’s horrified eyes. Joffrey staggered </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and whirled around, roaring curses. Mycah ran for the trees as fast as his legs would </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">take him. Arya swung at the prince again, but this time Joffrey caught the blow on </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lion’s Tooth and sent her broken stick flying from her hands. The back of his head </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was all bloody and his eyes were on fire. Sansa was shrieking, “No, no, stop it, stop </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it, both of you, you’re spoiling it,” but no one was listening. Arya scooped up a rock </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and hurled it at Joffrey’s head. She hit his horse instead, and the blood bay reared </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and went galloping off after Mycah. “<i>Stop it, don’t, stop it!</i>” Sansa screamed. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Joffrey slashed at Arya with his sword, screaming obscenities, terrible words, filthy </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">words. Arya darted back, frightened now, but Joffrey followed, hounding her </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">toward the woods, backing her up against a tree. Sansa didn’t know what to do. She </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="466" height="22" font="2">watched helplessly, almost blind from her tears. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Then a grey blur flashed past her, and suddenly Nymeria was there, leaping, </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">jaws closing around Joffrey’s sword arm. The steel fell from his fingers as the wolf </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knocked him off his feet, and they rolled in the grass, the wolf snarling and ripping </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="718" height="22" font="2">at him, the prince shrieking in pain. “Get it <i>off</i>,” he screamed. “Get it <i>off</i>!” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="446" height="22" font="2">Arya’s voice cracked like a whip. “<i>Nymeria!</i>” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The direwolf let go of Joffrey and moved to Arya’s side. The prince lay in the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grass, whimpering, cradling his mangled arm. His shirt was soaked in blood. Arya </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">said, “She didn’t hurt you. . . much.” She picked up Lion’s Tooth where it had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="608" height="22" font="2">fallen, and stood over him, holding the sword with both hands. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jofftey made a scared whimpery sound as he looked up at her. “No,” he said, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">“don’t hurt me. I’ll tell my mother.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="512" height="22" font="2">“<i>You leave him alone!</i>” Sansa screamed at her sister. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya whirled and heaved the sword into the air, putting her whole body into </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the throw. The blue steel flashed in the sun as the sword spun out over the river. It </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hit the water and vanished with a splash. Joffrey moaned. Arya ran off to her horse, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">Nymeria loping at her heels. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">After they had gone, Sansa went to Prince Joffrey. His eyes were closed in </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pain, his breath ragged. Sansa knelt beside him. “Joffrey,” she sobbed. “Oh, look </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">what they did, look what they did. My poor prince. Don’t be afraid. I’ll ride to the </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His eyes snapped open and looked at her, and there was nothing but loathing </text>

<text top="290" left="226" width="439" height="22" font="2">Ned rose quickly. “Our men or Lannister’s?” </text>
<text top="318" left="226" width="646" height="22" font="2">“It was Jory,” his steward Vayon  Poole replied. “She’s not been </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">harmed.” </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Thank the gods,” Ned said. His men had been searching for Arya for four </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">days now, but the queen’s men had been out hunting as well. “Where is she? Tell </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="304" height="22" font="2">Jory to bring her here at once.” </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I am sorry, my lord,” Poole told him. “The guards on the gate were Lannister </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">men, and they informed the queen when Jory brought her in. She’s being taken </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">directly before the king. . .” </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“<i>Damn </i>that woman!” Ned said, striding to the door. “Find Sansa and bring her </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to the audience chamber. Her voice may be needed.” He descended the tower steps </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in a red rage. He had led searches himself for the first three days, and had scarcely </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">slept an hour since Arya had disappeared. This morning he had been so heartsick </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and weary he could scarcely stand, but now his fury was on him, filling him with </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">strength. </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Men called out to him as he crossed the castle yard, but Ned ignored them in </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his haste. He would have run, but he was still the King’s Hand, and a Hand must </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">keep his dignity. He was aware of the eyes that followed him, of the muttered </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">voices wondering what he would do. </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The castle was a modest holding a half day’s ride south of the Trident. The </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Darry, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher’s boy was conducted on both sides </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of the river. They were not welcome visitors. Ser Raymun lived under the king’s </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">peace, but his family had fought beneath Rhaegar’s dragon banners at the Trident, </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and his three older brothers had died there, a truth neither Robert nor Ser Raymun </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">had forgotten. With king’s men, Darry men, Lannister men, and Stark men all </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions burned hot and heavy. </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The king had appropriated Ser Raymun’s audience chamber, and that was </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">where Ned found them. The room was crowded when he burst in. Too crowded, he </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">thought; left alone, he and Robert might have been able to settle the matter </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert was slumped in Darry’s high seat at the far end of the room, his face </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">closed and sullen. Cersei Lannister and her son stood beside him. The queen had </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="794" height="22" font="2">her hand on Joffrey’s shoulder. Thick silken bandages still covered the boy’s arm. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya stood in the center of the room, alone but for Jory Cassel, every eye </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">upon her. “Arya,” Ned called loudly. He went to her, his boots ringing on the stone </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="555" height="22" font="2">floor. When she saw him, she cried out and began to sob. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned went to one knee and took her in his arms. She was shaking. “I’m sorry,” </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">she sobbed, “I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I know,” he said. She felt so tiny in his arms, nothing but a scrawny little girl. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="698" height="22" font="2">It was hard to see how she had caused so much trouble. “Are you hurt?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“No.” Her face was dirty, and her tears left pink tracks down her cheeks. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="608" height="22" font="2">“Hungry some. I ate some berries, but there was nothing else.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We’ll feed you soon enough,” Ned promised. He rose to face the king. “What </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is the meaning of this?” His eyes swept the room, searching for friendly faces. But </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for his own men, they were few enough. Ser Raymun Darry guarded his look well. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly wore a half smile that might mean anything, and old Ser Barristan was </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">grave; the rest were Lannister men, and hostile. Their only good fortune was that </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">both Jaime Lannister and Sandor Clegane were missing, leading searches north of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">the Trident. “Why was I not told that my daughter had been found?” Ned </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="702" height="22" font="2">demanded, his voice ringing. “Why was she not brought to me at once?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He spoke to Robert, but it was Cersei Lannister who answered. “How  <i>dare</i> </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="389" height="22" font="2">you speak to your king in that manner!” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">At that, the king stirred. “Quiet, woman,” he snapped. He straightened in his </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seat. “I am sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. It seemed best to bring her </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="442" height="22" font="2">here and get the business done with quickly.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="523" height="22" font="2">“And what business is that?” Ned put ice in his voice. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The queen stepped forward. “You know full well, Stark. This girl of yours </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">attacked my son. Her and her butcher’s boy. That animal of hers tried to tear his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="94" height="22" font="2">arm off.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“That’s not true,” Arya said loudly. “She just bit him a little. He was hurting </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">Mycah.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Joff told us what happened,” the queen said. “You and the butcher boy beat </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“That’s not how it was,” Arya said, close to tears again. Ned put a hand on her </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">shoulder. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Yes it is!” Prince Joffrey insisted. “They all attacked me, and she threw </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lion’s Tooth in the river!” Ned noticed that he did not so much as glance at Arya as </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">he spoke. </text>
</page>
<page number="124" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="200" height="22" font="2">“Liar!” Arya yelled. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="333" height="22" font="2">“Shut up!” the prince yelled back. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Enough!</i>” the king roared, rising from his seat, his voice thick with irritation. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Silence fell. He glowered at Arya through his thick beard. “Now, child, you will tell </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">me what happened. Tell it all, and tell it true. It is a great crime to lie to a king.” </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Then he looked over at his son. “When she is done, you will have your turn. Until </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="240" height="22" font="2">then, hold your tongue.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">As Arya began her story, Ned heard the door open behind him. He glanced </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">back and saw Vayon Poole enter with Sansa. They stood quietly at the back of the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hall as Arya spoke. When she got to the part where she threw Joffrey’s sword into </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the middle of the Trident, Renly Baratheon began to laugh. The king bristled. “Ser </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="591" height="22" font="2">Barristan, escort my brother from the hall before he chokes.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly stifled his laughter. “My brother is too kind. I can find the door </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">myself.” He bowed to Joffrey. “Perchance later you’ll tell me how a nine-year-old </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">girl the size of a wet rat managed to disarm you with a broom handle and throw </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your sword in the river.” As the door swung shut behind him, Ned heard him say, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">“Lion’s Tooth,” and guffaw once more. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Prince Joffrey was pale as he began his very different version of events. When </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his son was done talking, the king rose heavily from his seat, looking like a man </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">who wanted to be anywhere but here. “What in all the seven hells am I supposed to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="498" height="22" font="2">make of this? He says one thing, she says another.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They were not the only ones present,” Ned said. “Sansa, come here.” Ned </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had heard her version of the story the night Arya had vanished. He knew the truth. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">“Tell us what happened.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His eldest daughter stepped forward hesitantly. She was dressed in blue </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">velvets trimmed with white, a silver chain around her neck. Her thick auburn hair </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had been brushed until it shone. She blinked at her sister, then at the young prince. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“I don’t know,” she said tearfully, looking as though she wanted to bolt. “I don’t </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">remember. Everything happened so fast, I didn’t see. . .” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>You rotten!</i>” Arya shrieked. She flew at her sister like an arrow, knocking </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="624" height="22" font="2">Sansa down to the ground, pummeling her. “Liar, liar, liar, liar.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Arya, <i>stop it!</i>” Ned shouted. Jory pulled her off her sister, kicking. Sansa was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pale and shaking as Ned lifted her back to her feet. “Are you hurt?” he asked, but </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="521" height="22" font="2">she was staring at Arya, and she did not seem to hear. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“The girl is as wild as that filthy animal of hers,” Cersei Lannister said. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="301" height="22" font="2">“Robert, I want her punished.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Seven hells,” Robert swore. “Cersei, look at her. She’s a child. What would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It’s over. No </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="238" height="22" font="2">lasting harm was done.” </text>
</page>
<page number="125" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="718" height="22" font="2">The queen was furious. “Joff will carry those scars for the rest of his life.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert Baratheon looked at his eldest son. “So he will. Perhaps they will teach </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him a lesson. Ned, see that your daughter is disciplined. I will do the same with my </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">son.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="470" height="22" font="2">“Gladly, Your Grace,” Ned said with vast relief. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert started  to walk away, but the queen was not done. “And what of the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="730" height="22" font="2">direwolf?” she called after him. “What of the beast that savaged your son?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The king stopped, turned back, frowned. “I’d forgotten about the damned </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">wolf.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned could see Arya tense in Jory’s arms. Jory spoke up quickly. “We found </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">no trace of the direwolf, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="441" height="22" font="2">Robert did not look unhappy. “No? So be it.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The queen raised her voice. “A hundred golden dragons to the man who </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">brings me its skin!” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A costly pelt,” Robert grumbled. “I want no part  of this, woman. You can </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">damn well buy your furs with Lannister gold.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The queen regarded him coolly. “I had not thought you so niggardly. The king </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">I’d thought to wed would have laid a wolfskin across my bed before the sun went </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">down.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Robert’s face darkened with anger. “That would be a fine trick, without a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">wolf.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We have a wolf,” Cersei Lannister said. Her voice was very quiet, but her </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="307" height="22" font="2">green eyes shone with triumph. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">It took them all a moment to comprehend her words, but when they did, the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="603" height="22" font="2">king shrugged irritably. “As you will. Have Ser Ilyn see to it.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">“Robert, you cannot mean this,” Ned protested. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The king was in no mood for more argument. “Enough, Ned, I will hear no </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">more. A direwolf is a savage beast. Sooner or later it would have turned on your girl </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="754" height="22" font="2">the same way the other did on my son. Get her a dog, she’ll be happier for it.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">That was when Sansa finally seemed to comprehend. Her eyes were </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">frightened as they went to her father. “He doesn’t mean Lady, does he?” She saw </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the truth on his face. “No,” she said. “No, not Lady, Lady didn’t bite anybody, she’s </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">good. . .” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="649" height="22" font="2">“Lady wasn’t there,” Arya shouted angrily. “You leave her alone!” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stop them,” Sansa pleaded, “don’t let them do it, please, please, it wasn’t </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lady, it was Nymeria, Arya did it, you can’t, it wasn’t Lady, don’t let them hurt </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="701" height="22" font="2">Lady, I’ll make her be good, I promise, I promise. . .” She started to cry. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">All Ned could do was take her in his arms and hold her while she wept. He </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">looked across the room at Robert. His old friend, closer than any brother. “Please, </text>
</page>
<page number="126" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="726" height="22" font="2">Robert. For the love you bear me. For the love you bore my sister. Please.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The king looked at them for a long moment, then turned his eyes on his wife. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="420" height="22" font="2">“Damn you, Cersei,” he said with loathing. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned stood, gently disengaging himself from Sansa’s grasp. All the weariness </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the past four days had returned to him. “Do it yourself then, Robert,” he said in a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="721" height="22" font="2">voice cold and sharp as steel. “At least have the courage to do it yourself.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert looked at Ned with flat, dead eyes and left without a word, his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">footsteps heavy as lead. Silence filled the hall. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Where is the direwolf?” Cersei Lannister asked when her husband was gone. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">Beside her, Prince Joffrey was smiling. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The beast is chained up outside the gatehouse, Your Grace,” Ser Barristan </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">Selmy answered reluctantly. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="225" height="22" font="2">“Send for Ilyn Payne.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ned said. “Jory, take the girls back to their rooms and bring me Ice.” </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The words tasted of bile in his throat, but he forced them out. “If it must be done, I </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="109" height="22" font="2">will do it.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Cersei Lannister regarded him suspiciously. “You, Stark? Is this some trick? </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="334" height="22" font="2">Why would you do such a thing?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They were all staring at him, but it was Sansa’s look that cut. “She is of the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">north. She deserves better than a butcher.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He left the room with his eyes burning and his daughter’s wails echoing in his </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ears, and found the direwolf pup where they chained her. Ned sat beside her for a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">while. “Lady,” he said, tasting the name. He had never paid much attention to the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">names the children had picked, but looking at her now, he knew that  Sansa had </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">chosen well. She was the smallest of the litter, the prettiest, the most gentle and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">trusting. She looked at him with bright golden eyes, and he ruffled her thick grey </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="40" height="22" font="2">fur. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="295" height="22" font="2">Shortly, Jory brought him Ice. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When it was over, he said, “Choose four men and have them take the body </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="298" height="22" font="2">north. Bury her at Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="368" height="22" font="2">“All that way?” Jory said, astonished. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“All that way,” Ned affirmed. “The Lannister woman shall never have  <i>this</i> </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">skin.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He was walking back to the tower to give himself up to sleep at last when </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane and his riders came pounding through the castle gate, back from </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">their hunt. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">There was something slung over the back of his destrier, a heavy shape </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wrapped in a bloody cloak. “No sign of your daughter, Hand,” the Hound rasped </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down, “but the day was not wholly wasted. We got her little pet.” He reached back </text>

<page number="127" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="649" height="22" font="2">and shoved the burden off, and it fell with a thump in front of Ned. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bending, Ned pulled back the cloak, dreading the words he would have to find </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">for Arya, but it was not Nymeria after all. It was the butcher’s boy, Mycah, his body </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">covered in dried blood. He had been cut almost in half from shoulder to waist by </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">some terrible blow struck from above. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="323" height="22" font="2">“You rode him down,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">The Hound’s eyes seemed to glitter through the steel of that hideous dog’s-</text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="770" height="22" font="2">head helm. “He ran.” He looked at Ned’s face and laughed. “But not very fast.” </text>

<text top="400" left="54" width="542" height="22" font="2">the way he shattered. “But I never fall,” he said, falling. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The ground was so far below him he could barely make it out through the grey </text>

<text top="593" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The ground was closer now, still far far away, a thousand miles away, but </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">closer than it had been. It was cold here in the darkness. There was no sun, no stars, </text>

<text top="842" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">fell. “Help me,” he said. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="462" height="22" font="4"><i>I’m trying</i>, the crow replied. <i>Say, got any corn? </i></text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran reached into his pocket as the darkness spun dizzily around him. When </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he pulled his hand out, golden kernels slid from between his fingers into the air. </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">They fell with him. </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">The crow landed on his hand and began to eat. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="367" height="22" font="2">“Are you really a crow?” Bran asked. </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="4"><i>Are you really falling? </i>the crow asked back. </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="292" height="22" font="2">“It’s just a dream,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="211" height="22" font="4"><i>Is it? </i>asked the crow. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="544" height="22" font="2">“I’ll wake up when I hit the ground,” Bran told the bird. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="754" height="22" font="4"><i>You’ll die when you hit the ground</i>, the crow said. It went back to eating corn. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran looked down. He could see mountains now, their peaks white with snow, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="791" height="22" font="2">and the silver thread of rivers in dark woods. He closed his eyes and began to cry. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>That won’t do any good</i>, the crow said.  <i>I told you, the answer is flying, not </i></text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>crying. How hard can it be? I’m doing it</i>.  The crow took to the air and flapped </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">around Bran’s hand. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="363" height="22" font="2">“You have wings,” Bran pointed out. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="185" height="22" font="4"><i>Maybe you do too</i>. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="491" height="22" font="2">Bran felt along his shoulders, groping for feathers. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="477" height="22" font="4"><i>There are different kinds of wings</i>, the crow said. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran was staring at his arms, his legs. He was so skinny, just skin stretched </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">taut over bones. Had he always been so thin? He tried to remember. A face swam </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">up at him out of the grey mist, shining with light, golden. “The things I do for love,” </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">it said. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="155" height="22" font="2">Bran screamed. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The crow took to the air, cawing. <i>Not that</i>, it shrieked at him. <i>Forget that, you </i></text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>do not need it now, put it aside, put it away</i>.  It landed on Bran’s shoulder, and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="519" height="22" font="2">pecked at him, and the shining golden face was gone. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran was falling faster than ever. The grey mists howled around him as he </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">plunged toward the earth below. “What are you doing to me?” he asked the crow, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">tearful. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="243" height="22" font="4"><i>Teaching you how to fly</i>. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="130" height="22" font="2">“I can’t fly!” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="237" height="22" font="4"><i>You’re flying right now</i>. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="139" height="22" font="2">“I’m <i>falling</i>!” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="554" height="22" font="4"><i>Every flight begins with a fall</i>, the crow said. <i>Look down</i>. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="154" height="22" font="2">“I’m afraid. . .” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="155" height="22" font="4"><i>LOOK DOWN! </i></text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran looked down, and felt his insides turn to water. The ground was rushing </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">up at him now. The whole world was spread out below him, a tapestry of white and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brown and green. He could see everything so clearly that for a moment he forgot to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="578" height="22" font="2">be afraid. He could see the whole realm, and everyone in it. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He saw Winterfell as the eagles see it, the tall towers looking squat and stubby </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from above, the castle walls just lines in the dirt. He saw Maester Luwin on his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">balcony, studying the sky through a polished bronze tube and frowning as he made </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">notes in a book. He saw his brother Robb, taller and stronger than he remembered </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him, practicing swordplay in the yard with real steel in his hand. He saw Hodor, the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">simple giant from the stables, carrying an anvil to Mikken’s forge, hefting it onto </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his shoulder as easily as another man might heft a bale of hay. At the heart of the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">godswood, the great white weirwood brooded over its reflection in the black pool, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">its leaves rustling in a chill wind. When it felt Bran watching, it lifted its eyes from </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="483" height="22" font="2">the still waters and stared back at him knowingly. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He looked east, and saw a galley racing across the waters of the Bite. He saw </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his mother sitting alone in a cabin, looking at a bloodstained knife on a table in </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">front of her, as the rowers pulled at their oars and Ser Rodrik leaned across a rail, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shaking and heaving. A storm was gathering ahead of them, a vast dark roaring </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="536" height="22" font="2">lashed by lightning, but somehow they could not see it. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He looked south, and saw the great blue-green rush of the Trident. He saw his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">father  pleading with the king, his face etched with grief. He saw Sansa crying </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">herself to sleep at night, and he saw Arya watching in silence and holding her </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">secrets hard in her heart. There were shadows all around them. One shadow was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dark as ash, with the terrible face of a hound. Another was armored like the sun, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">golden and beautiful. Over them both loomed a giant in armor made of stone, but </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he opened his visor, there was nothing inside but darkness and thick black </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">blood. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He lifted his eyes and saw clear across the narrow sea, to the Free Cities and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the green Dothraki sea and beyond, to Vaes Dothrak under its mountain, to the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">fabled lands of the Jade Sea,  to Asshai by the Shadow, where dragons stirred </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="196" height="22" font="2">beneath the sunrise. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Finally he looked north. He saw the  Wall shining like blue crystal, and his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bastard brother Jon sleeping alone in a cold bed, his skin growing pale and hard as </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the memory of all warmth fled from him. And he looked past the Wall, past endless </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forests cloaked in snow, past the frozen shore and the great blue-white rivers of ice </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and the dead plains where nothing grew or lived. North and north and north he </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked, to the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid, and the heat </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="325" height="22" font="2">of his tears burned on his cheeks. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Now you know</i>, the crow whispered as it sat on his shoulder.  <i>Now you know </i></text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="4"><i>why you must live</i>. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="522" height="22" font="2">“Why?” Bran said, not understanding, falling, falling. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="258" height="22" font="4"><i>Because winter is coming</i>. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran looked at the crow on his shoulder, and the crow looked back. It had </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">three eyes, and the third eye was full of a terrible knowledge. Bran looked down. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">There was nothing below him now but snow and cold and death, a frozen wasteland </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">where jagged blue-white spires of ice waited to embrace him. They flew up at him </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">like spears. He saw the bones of a thousand other dreamers impaled upon their </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">points. He was desperately afraid. </text>
</page>
<page number="131" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?” he heard his own voice saying, small </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">and far away. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">And his father’s voice replied to him. “That is the only time a man can be </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">brave.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="463" height="22" font="4"><i>Now, Bran</i>, the crow urged. <i>Choose. Fly or die</i>. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="338" height="22" font="2">Death reached for him, screaming. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="303" height="22" font="2">Bran spread his arms and flew. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Wings unseen drank the wind and filled and pulled him upward. The terrible </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">needles of ice receded below him. The sky opened up above. Bran soared. It was </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">better than climbing. It was better than anything. The world grew small beneath </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="356" height="22" font="2">“I’m flying!” he cried out in delight. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>I’ve noticed</i>, said the three-eyed crow. It took to the air, flapping its wings in </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his face, slowing him, blinding him. He faltered in the air as its pinions beat against </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his cheeks. Its beak stabbed at him fiercely, and Bran felt a sudden blinding pain in </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">the middle of his forehead, between his eyes. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="350" height="22" font="2">“What are you doing?” he shrieked. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The crow opened its beak and cawed at him, a shrill scream of fear, and the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grey mists shuddered and swirled around him and ripped away like a veil, and he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw that the crow was really a woman, a serving woman with long black hair, and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he knew her from somewhere, from Winterfell, yes, that was it, he remembered her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">now, and then he realized that he was in Winterfell, in a bed high in some chilly </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tower room, and the black-haired woman dropped a basin of water to shatter on the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">floor and ran down the steps, shouting, “He’s awake, he’s awake, he’s awake.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran touched his forehead, between his eyes. The place where the crow had </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pecked him was still burning, but there was nothing there, no blood, no wound. He </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">felt weak and dizzy. He tried to get out of bed, but nothing happened. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And then there was movement beside the bed, and something landed lightly </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on his legs. He felt nothing. A pair of yellow eyes looked into his own, shining like </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the sun. The window was open and it was cold in the room, but the warmth that </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">came off the wolf enfolded him like a hot bath. His pup, Bran realized. . . or was it? </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">He was so <i>big</i> now. He reached out to pet him, his hand trembling like a leaf. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">tower steps, the direwolf was licking Bran’s face. Bran looked up calmly. “His </text>

<text top="290" left="260" width="610" height="22" font="2">Catelyn turned away from the rail and forced herself to smile. </text>
<text top="318" left="206" width="668" height="22" font="2">“Your oarmen have done well by us, Captain. Each one of them </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="502" height="22" font="2">shall have a silver stag, as a token of my gratitude.” </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Captain Moreo Turnitis favored her with a half bow. “You are far too </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">generous, Lady Stark. The honor of carrying a great lady like yourself is all the </text>

<text top="456" left="108" width="358" height="22" font="2">“But they’ll take the silver anyway.” </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Moreo smiled. “As you say.” He spoke the Common Tongue fluently, with </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">only the slightest hint of a Tyroshi accent. He’d been plying the narrow sea for </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thirty years, he’d told her, as oarman, quartermaster, and finally captain of his own </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">trading galleys. The <i>Storm Dancer</i> was his fourth ship, and his fastest, a two-masted </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">galley of sixty oars. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She had certainly been the fastest of the ships available in White Harbor when </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Catelyn and Ser Rodrik Cassel had arrived after their headlong gallop downriver. </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The Tyroshi were notorious for their avarice, and Ser Rodrik had argued for hiring a </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fishing sloop out of the Three Sisters, but Catelyn had insisted on the galley. It was </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">good that she had. The winds had been against them much of the voyage, and </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">without the galley’s oars they’d still be beating their way past the Fingers, instead </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="542" height="22" font="2">of skimming toward King’s Landing and journey’s end. </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>So close</i>, she thought. Beneath the linen bandages, her fingers still throbbed </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">where the dagger had bitten. The pain was her scourge, Catelyn felt, lest she forget. </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She could not bend the last two fingers on her left hand, and the others would never </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">again be dexterous. Yet that was a small enough price to pay for Bran’s life. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik chose that moment to appear on deck. “My good friend,” said </text>

<text top="1007" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Ser Rodrik agreed. “I haven’t wanted to die for almost two days now.” </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the side when the storm seized them unexpectedly off Dragonstone, yet somehow </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he had clung to a rope until three of Moreo’s men could rescue him and carry him </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">safely below decks. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="761" height="22" font="2">“The captain was just telling me that our voyage is almost at an end,” she said. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik managed a wry smile. “So soon?” He looked odd without his great </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">white side whiskers; smaller somehow, less fierce, and ten years older. Yet back on </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Bite it had seemed prudent to submit to a crewman’s razor, after his whiskers </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had become hopelessly befouled for the third time while he leaned over the rail and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">retched into the swirling winds. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I will leave you to discuss your business,” Captain Moreo said. He bowed </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">and took his leave of them. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The galley skimmed the water like a dragonfly, her oars rising and falling in </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">perfect time. Ser Rodrik held the rail and looked out over the passing shore. “I have </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">not been the most valiant of protectors.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn touched his arm. “We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">truly matters.” Her hand groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The dagger was still at her side. She found she had to touch it now and then, to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">reassure herself. “Now we must reach the king’s master-at-arms, and pray that he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">can be trusted.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one.” Ser Rodrik’s hand went </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looked nonplussed. “He may know the blade, yes. . . but, my lady, the moment we </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will know you on sight.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn’s mouth grew tight. “Littlefinger,” she murmured. His face swam up </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">before her; a boy’s face, though he was a boy no longer. His father had died several </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called him Littlefinger. Her </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. His family’s </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">short for his age. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik cleared his throat. “Lord Baelish once, ah. . .” His thought trailed </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">off uncertainly in search of the polite word. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn was past delicacy. “He was my father’s ward. We grew up together in </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Riverrun. I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were. . . more than </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">brotherly. When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, Petyr </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyr’s  life. He let him off with a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scar. Afterward my father sent him away. I have not seen him since.” She lifted her </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away. “He wrote to </text>
</page>
<page number="134" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">knew that Ned would marry me in his brother’s place.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="777" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik’s fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="428" height="22" font="2">“Littlefinger sits on the small council now.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I knew he would rise high,” Catelyn said. “He was always clever, even as a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">have done to him.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">High overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around them the  <i>Storm Dancer</i> </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">burst into frenetic activity as King’s Landing slid into view atop its three high hills. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Three hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">forest, and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into the sea. Then Aegon the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put ashore, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and granaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchant’s stalls, taverns </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and graveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. She could hear the clamor of </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings were broad roads lined </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with trees, wandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not walk abreast. Visenya’s hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors closed </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">now for a century. The Street of the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="500" height="22" font="2">The city walls rose in the distance, high and strong. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Pentos and Lys. Catelyn spied the queen’s ornate barge, tied up beside a fat-bellied </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whaler from the Port of Ibben,  its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">golden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">water. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And above it all, frowning down from Aegon’s high hill, was the Red Keep; </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and dungeons and granaries, massive </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">curtain walls studded with archers’ nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. Aegon the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">completed. Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know </text>

<page number="135" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="608" height="22" font="2">the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="337" height="22" font="2">crowned stag of House Baratheon. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">its white sails huge with wind. The <i>Storm Dancer</i> moved past it, pulling steadily for </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">shore. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My lady,” Ser Rodrik said, “I have thought on how best to proceed while I </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lay abed. You must not enter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">to you in some safe place.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities. “You would be as much at risk as </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">I would.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik smiled. “I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and scarcely recognized myself. My mother was the last person to see me without </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="731" height="22" font="2">whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe I am safe enough, my lady.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Moreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the river, then </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">inside the hull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">up. Moreo came bustling up, all smiles. “King’s Landing, my lady, as you did </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage. Will you be </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="629" height="22" font="2">someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. “Just so. I know of several </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">establishments that might suit your needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon. And of course the extra </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="407" height="22" font="2">“For the oarmen,” Catelyn reminded him. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, of a certainty,” said Moreo. “Though perhaps I should hold it for them </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">until we return to Tyrosh. For the sake of their wives and children. If you give them </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="814" height="22" font="2">the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a night’s pleasure.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“There are worse things to spend money on,” Ser Rodrik put in. “Winter is </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">coming.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A man must make his own choices,” Catelyn said. “They earned the silver. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="412" height="22" font="2">How they spend it is no concern of mine.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="581" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lady,” Moreo replied, bowing and smiling. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenya’s hill to the inn </text>

<page number="136" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley. The woman </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">rooms were large and airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. Best of all, she had no interest in their </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">names. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I think it best if you stay away  from the common room,” Ser Rodrik said, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">after they had settled in. “Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">watching.” He wore ringmail, dagger, and longsword under a dark cloak with a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hood he could pull up over his head. “I will be back before nightfall, with Ser </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="415" height="22" font="2">Aron,” he promised. “Rest now, my lady.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn  <i>was</i>  tired. The voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">longer as young as she had been. Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She watched Ser Rodrik set off, striding </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers, but she had no </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">trouble falling asleep. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">She woke to a pounding on her door. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of King’s Landing </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were red in the light of the setting sun. She had slept longer than she intended. A </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called out, “Open, in the name of the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">king.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A moment,” she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was on the bedside table. She snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">door. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the City Watch. Their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, “No need </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="495" height="22" font="2">for that, m’lady. We’re to escort you to the castle.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="315" height="22" font="2">“By whose authority?” she said. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was a mockingbird, in grey wax. “Petyr,” she said. So soon. Something must have </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">happened to Ser Rodrik. She looked at the head guardsman. “Do you know who I </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">am?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No, m’lady,” he said. “M’lord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="333" height="22" font="2">see that you were not mistreated.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">Catelyn nodded. “You may wait outside while I dress.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. Her </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">drab brown cloak about her neck. How could Littlefinger have known she was </text>

<page number="137" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">here? Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he was stubborn, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached King’s Landing </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">before her? No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">come to her. How. . . ? </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Then she thought, <i>Moreo</i>. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">were, damn him. She hoped he’d gotten a good price for the information. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They had brought a horse for her. The lamps were being lit along the streets as </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they set out, and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the guard in their golden cloaks. When they reached the Red Keep, the portcullis </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle windows were alive </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">escorted her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil lamp beside </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">her. “Cat,” he said quietly. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">“Why have I been brought here in this fashion?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. “Leave us.” The men departed. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">“You were not mistreated, I trust,” he said after they had gone. “I gave firm </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">instructions.” He noticed her bandages. “Your hands. . .” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">Catelyn ignored the implied question. “I am not accustomed to being </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">summoned like a serving wench,” she said icily. “As a boy, you still knew the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">meaning of courtesy.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’ve angered you, my lady. That was never my intent.” He looked contrite. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The look brought back vivid memories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a gift he had. The years had not </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a small man, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beard now, and threads of silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">They went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak. Even as a child, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="301" height="22" font="2">he had always loved his silver. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="530" height="22" font="2">“How did you know I was in the city?” she asked him. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Lord Varys knows all,” Petyr said with a sly smile. “He will be joining us </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="78" height="22" font="2">years?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn ignored his familiarity. There were more important questions. “So it </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="380" height="22" font="2">was the King’s Spider who found me.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger winced. “You don’t want to call him that. He’s very sensitive. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Comes of being an eunuch, I imagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys </text>

<page number="138" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">knowing. Ofttimes he knows about it  <i>before</i>  it happens. He has informants </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">everywhere. His little birds, he calls them. One of his little birds heard about your </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">visit. Thankfully, Varys came to me first.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="127" height="22" font="2">“Why you?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He shrugged. “Why not me? I am master of coin, the king’s own councillor. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Selmy and Lord Renly rode north to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis  is gone to </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me. I was the obvious choice. I was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="508" height="22" font="2">ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="289" height="22" font="2">“Does Varys know about. . .” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Lord Varys knows everything. . . except why you are here.” He lifted an </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="307" height="22" font="2">eyebrow. “Why <i>are</i> you here?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">daughters close, who can tell her no?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger laughed. “Oh, very good, my lady, but please don’t expect me to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="676" height="22" font="2">believe that. I know you too well. What were the Tully words again?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her throat was dry. “<i>Family, Duty, Honor</i>,” she recited stiffly. He did know </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">her too well. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Family, Duty, Honor,” he echoed. “All of which required you to remain in </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, where our Hand left you. No, my lady, something has happened.  This </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. I beg of you, let me help. Old </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other.” There was a soft knock </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="428" height="22" font="2">on the door. “Enter,” Littlefinger called out. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as hairless as an egg. He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet. “Lady Stark,” he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said, taking her hand in both of his, “to see you again after so many years is such a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">joy.” His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. “Oh, your poor </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hands. Have you burned yourself, sweet lady? The fingers are so delicate. . . Our </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="684" height="22" font="2">good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. “I thank you, my lord, but my own </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Varys bobbed his head. “I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="300" height="22" font="2">so young. The gods are cruel.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“On that we agree, Lord Varys,” she said. The title was but a courtesy due him </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as a council member; Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">none but his whisperers. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The eunuch spread his soft hands. “On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="142" height="22" font="2">King Robert.” </text>
</page>
<page number="139" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” she was forced to say. “For a certainty.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert,” quipped Littlefinger. He </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="472" height="22" font="2">smiled slyly. “At least in Lord Varys’s hearing.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Good lady,” Varys said with great solicitude. “There are men in the Free </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Cities with wondrous healing powers. Say only the word, and I will send for one for </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">your dear Bran.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran,” she told him. She </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would not speak of Bran, not here, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger only </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let them see her grief. “Lord Baelish </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Varys giggled like a little girl. “Oh, yes. I suppose I am guilty. I hope you </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">forgive me, kind lady.” He eased himself down into a seat and put his hands </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="662" height="22" font="2">together. “I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He <i>was</i> a spider, she </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thought wildly, an enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="616" height="22" font="2">unless. . . “What have you done to Ser Rodrik?” she demanded. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger was lost. “I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">without his lance. What dagger are we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell,” Varys informed him. “I </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">assure you, Lady Stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser Aron Santagar in the armory, and they </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">talked of a certain dagger. About sunset, they left the castle together and walked to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">common room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">gone.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="317" height="22" font="2">“How could you know all that?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The whisperings of little birds,” Varys said, smiling. “I know things, sweet </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lady. That is the nature of my service.” He shrugged. “You <i>do</i> have the dagger with </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">you, yes?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">front of him. “Here. Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="122" height="22" font="2">belongs to.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">edge. Blood welled, and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">table. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="401" height="22" font="2">“Careful,” Catelyn told him, “it’s sharp.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel,” Littlefinger said as Varys sucked </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. He flipped it in the air, caught it </text>
</page>
<page number="140" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">again with his other hand. “Such sweet balance. You want to find the owner, is that </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="256" height="22" font="2">should have come to me.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="561" height="22" font="2">“And if I had,” she said, “what would you have told me?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at King’s </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Landing.” He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger, drew it back over </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. “It’s mine.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="587" height="22" font="2">“<i>Yours?</i>” It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Until the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day,” he said, crossing the room </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to wrench the dagger from the wood. “I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with half the court.” Petyr’s sheepish grin made him look half a boy again. “When </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime lost a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Who?</i>” Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="179" height="22" font="2">remembered pain. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“The Imp,” said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. “Tyrion </text>

<text top="318" left="122" width="751" height="22" font="2">Jon’s chest as he pressed the attack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">himself clumsily. When he raised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boy’s leg and sent him </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">staggering. Grenn’s downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow. Jon </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">pain. </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="726" height="22" font="2">“<i>Enough!</i>” Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">Grenn cradled his hand. “The bastard broke my wrist.” </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. </text>

<text top="704" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">frosty morning air felt good on his face. He leaned on his sword, drew a deep </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="572" height="22" font="2">breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“That is a longsword, not an old man’s cane,” Ser Alliser said sharply. “Are </text>

<text top="842" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he came to practice. The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">slid the longsword back into its scabbard. “No,” he replied. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moved. He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="644" height="22" font="2">hair and eyes like chips of onyx. “The truth now,” he commanded. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I’m tired,” Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done. </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="241" height="22" font="2">“What you are is weak.” </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="89" height="22" font="2">“I won.” </text>
<text top="258" left="54" width="96" height="101" font="6">T </text>

<page number="142" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="240" height="22" font="2">“No. The Aurochs lost.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">One of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">master-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">course, he hated the other boys even worse. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That will be all,” Thorne told them. “I can only stomach so much ineptitude </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">in any one day. If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">alone here. There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could call a friend. Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit. Pyp </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Halder’s blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">he spent with them, the more Jon despised them. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the others around him. Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">long room, but Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with him here. In </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">fastenings on his cloak.  <i>So cold</i>,  he thought, remembering the warm halls of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a man’s </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">here, and the people colder. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">No one had told him the Night’s Watch would be like this; no one except </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="624" height="22" font="2">like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person. He was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="400" height="22" font="2">than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him. Benjen </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">refused him curtly. “This is not Winterfell,” he told him as he cut his meat with fork </text>
</page>
<page number="143" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and dagger. “On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. You’re no ranger, Jon, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Stupidly, Jon argued. “I’ll be fifteen on my name day,” he said. “Almost a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="131" height="22" font="2">man grown.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Benjen Stark frowned. “A boy you are, and a boy you’ll remain until Ser </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Night’s Watch. If you thought your Stark </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. We put aside our old families </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when we swear our vows. Your father will always have a place in my heart, but </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>these</i> are my brothers now.” He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="297" height="22" font="2">all the hard cold men in black. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave. One of his rangers, a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="623" height="22" font="2">“How often must I tell you no, Jon? We’ll speak when I return.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his mind’s eye he </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="2">What was he becoming? </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="212" height="22" font="2">in his thick white fur. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">implacable as winter. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but “my half </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">brother” since she was old enough to  understand what  <i>bastard</i>  meant. And </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Arya. . . he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seemed to fit, no more than he had. . . yet she could always make Jon smile. He </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="536" height="22" font="2">her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="349" height="22" font="2">“You broke my wrist, bastard boy.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and red of face, with three of his friends behind him. He knew Todder, a short ugly </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all called him Toad. The other two were </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, rapers taken down in </text>
</page>
<page number="144" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Fingers. He’d forgotten their names. He hardly ever spoke to them, if he could </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="2">help it. They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon stood up. “I’ll break the other one for you if you ask nicely.” Grenn was </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sixteen  and a head taller than Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">they did not scare him. He’d beaten every one of them in the yard. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="474" height="22" font="2">“Maybe we’ll break you,” one of the rapers said. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Try.” Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">twisted it behind his back. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="429" height="22" font="2">“You make us look bad,” complained Toad. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You looked bad before I ever met you,” Jon told him. The boy who had his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">arm jerked upward on him, hard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">out. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Toad stepped close. “The little lordling has a mouth on him,” he said. He had </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pig eyes, small and shiny. “Is that your mommy’s mouth, bastard? What was she, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="742" height="22" font="2">some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her a time or two.” He laughed. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">holding him. There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free. He flew at Toad, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="531" height="22" font="2">his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Grenn began to kick at him. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="640" height="22" font="2">voice cut through the gloom of the armory. “STOP THIS! <i>NOW!</i>” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them. “The yard </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">is for fighting,” the armorer said. “Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or I’ll </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">make them my quarrels. You won’t like that.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="345" height="22" font="2">away bloody. “He tried to kill me.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="414" height="22" font="2">“’S true. I saw it,” one of the rapers put in. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="750" height="22" font="2">“He broke my wrist,” Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. “A bruise. Perhaps </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">a sprain. Maester Aemon will give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="815" height="22" font="2">wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your cells. Not you, Snow. You stay.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution. His arm was </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">throbbing. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Watch has need of every man it can get,” Donal Noye said when they </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">were alone. “Even men like Toad. You won’t win any honors killing him.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="462" height="22" font="2">Jon’s anger flared. “He said my mother was—” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="371" height="22" font="2">“—a whore. I heard him. What of it?” </text>
</page>
<page number="145" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores,” Jon said icily. “His </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">honor—” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="555" height="22" font="2">“—did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="353" height="22" font="2">Jon was cold with rage. “Can I go?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="310" height="22" font="2">“You go when I tell you to go.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around. “Look at me when I’m </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="204" height="22" font="2">talking to you, boy.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a longsword. “Words won’t make your mother a whore. She was what she was, and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nothing Toad says can change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="228" height="22" font="2">mothers <i>were</i> whores.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="4"><i>Not my mother</i>, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">eyes were kind. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You think you had it hard, being a high lord’s bastard?” the armorer went on. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“That boy Jeren is a septon’s get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">wench. Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I don’t care,” Jon said. “I don’t care about them and I don’t care about you or </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it. I hate it here. It’s too. . .  it’s cold.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yes. Cold and hard and mean, that’s the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">wet nurse. This is the way it is, and you’re here for life, same as the rest of us.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Life,” Jon repeated bitterly. The armorer could talk about life. He’d had one. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He’d only taken the black after he’d lost an arm at the siege of Storm’s End. Before </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that he’d smithed for Stannis Baratheon, the king’s brother. He’d seen the Seven </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Kingdoms from one end to the other; he’d feasted and wenched and fought in a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">hundred battles. They said it was Donal Noye who’d forged King Robert’s </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">warhammer, the one that crushed the life from Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He’d done all the things that Jon would never do, and then when he was old, well </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">past thirty, he’d taken a glancing blow from an axe and the wound had festered until </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the whole arm had to come off. Only then, crippled, had Donal Noye come to the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">Wall, when his life was all but over. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes, life,” Noye said. “A long life or a short one, it’s up to you, Snow. The </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="787" height="22" font="2">road you’re walking, one of your brothers will slit your throat for you one night.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They’re not my brothers,” Jon snapped. “They hate me because I’m better </text>

<page number="146" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">than they are.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No. They hate you because you act like you’re better than they are. They </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">look at you and see a castle-bred bastard who thinks he’s a lordling.” The armorer </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">leaned close. “You’re no lordling. Remember that. You’re a Snow, not a Stark. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">You’re a bastard and a bully.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A  <i>bully</i>?” Jon almost choked on the word. The accusation was so unjust it </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">took his breath away. “They were the ones who came after me. Four of them.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Four that you’ve humiliated in the yard. Four who are probably afraid of you. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">I’ve watched you fight. It’s not training with you. Put a good edge on your sword, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and they’d be dead meat; you know it, I know it, they know it. You leave them </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">nothing. You shame them. Does that make you proud?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon hesitated. He did feel proud when he won. Why shouldn’t he? But the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">armorer was taking that away too, making it sound as if he were doing something </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="547" height="22" font="2">wrong. “They’re all older than me,” he said defensively. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">“Older and bigger and stronger, that’s the truth. I’ll wager your master-at-</text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">arms taught you how to fight bigger men at Winterfell, though. Who was he, some </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">old knight?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Rodrik Cassel,” Jon said warily. There was a trap here. He felt it closing </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="122" height="22" font="2">around him. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Donal Noye leaned forward, into Jon’s face. “Now think on this, boy. None of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">these others have ever had a master-at-arms until Ser Alliser. Their fathers were </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">farmers and wagonmen and poachers, smiths and miners and oars on a trading </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">galley. What they know of fighting they learned between decks, in the alleys of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Oldtown and Lannisport, in wayside brothels and taverns on the kingsroad. They </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">may have clacked a few sticks together before they came here, but I promise you, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not one in twenty was ever rich enough to own a real sword.” His look was grim. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="641" height="22" font="2">“So how do you like the taste of your victories now, Lord Snow?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Don’t call me that!” Jon said sharply, but the force had gone out of his anger. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">Suddenly he felt ashamed and guilty. “I never. . .  I didn’t think. . .” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Best you start thinking,” Noye warned him. “That, or sleep with a dagger by </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="196" height="22" font="2">your bed. Now go.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">By the time Jon left the armory, it was almost midday. The sun had broken </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">through the clouds. He turned his back on it and lifted his eyes to the Wall, blazing </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blue and crystalline in the sunlight. Even after all these weeks, the sight of it still </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">gave him the shivers. Centuries of windblown dirt had pocked and scoured it, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">covering it like a film, and it often seemed a pale grey, the color of an overcast </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sky. . . but when the sun caught it fair on a bright day, it <i>shone</i>, alive with light, a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">colossal blue-white cliff that filled up half the sky. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon </text>
</page>
<page number="147" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. “And </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beyond a doubt the most useless,” Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from miles off, a pale blue </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in the far distance, immense and unbroken. <i>This is the end of the world</i>, it seemed to </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="44" height="22" font="2">say. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When they finally spied Castle Black, its timbered keeps and stone towers </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">looked like nothing more than a handful of toy blocks scattered on the snow, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beneath the vast wall of ice. The ancient stronghold of the black brothers was no </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, no true castle at all. Lacking walls, it could not be defended, not from </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the south, or east, or west;  but it was only the north that concerned the Night’s </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Watch, and to the north loomed the Wall. Almost seven hundred feet high it stood, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">three times the height of the tallest tower in the stronghold it sheltered. His uncle </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">said the top was wide enough for a  dozen armored knights to ride abreast. The </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">gaunt outlines of huge catapults and monstrous wooden cranes stood sentry up </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">there, like the skeletons of great birds, and among them walked men in black as </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">small as ants. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As he stood outside the armory looking up, Jon felt almost as overwhelmed as </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he had that day on the kingsroad, when he’d seen it for the first time. The Wall was </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">like that. Sometimes he could almost forget that it was there, the way you forgot </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">about the sky or the earth underfoot, but there were other times when it seemed as if </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">there was nothing else in the world. It was older than the Seven Kingdoms, and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">when he stood beneath it and looked up, it made Jon dizzy. He could feel the great </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">weight of all that ice pressing down on him, as if it were about to topple, and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="531" height="22" font="2">somehow Jon knew that if it fell, the world fell with it. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="593" height="22" font="2">“Makes you wonder what lies beyond,” a familiar voice said. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="738" height="22" font="2">Jon looked around. “Lannister. I didn’t see—I mean, I thought I was alone.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister was bundled in furs so thickly he looked like a very small </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bear. “There’s much to be said for taking people unawares. You never know what </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="175" height="22" font="2">you might learn.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You won’t learn anything from me,” Jon told him. He had seen little of the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dwarf since their journey ended. As the queen’s own brother, Tyrion Lannister had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been an honored guest of the Night’s Watch. The Lord Commander had given him </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rooms in the King’s Tower—so-called, though no king had visited it for a hundred </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">years—and Lannister dined at Mormont’s own table and spent his days riding the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Wall and his nights dicing and drinking with Ser Alliser and Bowen Marsh and the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">other high officers. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I learn things everywhere I go.” The little man gestured up at the Wall </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a gnarled black walking stick. “As I was saying. . . why is it that when one </text>
</page>
<page number="148" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">man builds a wall, the next man immediately needs to know what’s on the other </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">side?” He cocked his head and looked at Jon with his curious mismatched eyes. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="586" height="22" font="2">“You <i>do</i> want to know what’s on the other side, don’t you?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It’s nothing special,” Jon said. He wanted to ride with Benjen Stark on his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">rangings, deep into the mysteries of the haunted forest, wanted to fight Mance </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Rayder’s wildlings and ward the realm against the Others, but it was better not to </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">speak of the things you wanted. “The rangers say it’s just woods and mountains and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">frozen lakes, with lots of snow and ice.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“And the grumkins and the snarks,” Tyrion said. “Let us not forget them, Lord </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">Snow, or else what’s that big thing for?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="279" height="22" font="2">“Don’t call me Lord Snow.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The dwarf lifted an eyebrow. “Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">see that their words can cut you, and you’ll never be free of the mockery. If they </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can’t hurt you with it </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">anymore.” He gestured with his stick. “Come, walk with me. They’ll be serving </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">some vile stew in the common hall by now, and I could do with a bowl of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">something hot.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon was hungry too, so he fell in beside Lannister and slowed his pace to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">match the dwarf’s awkward, waddling steps. The wind was rising, and they could </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hear the old wooden buildings creaking around them, and in the distance a heavy </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shutter banging, over and over, forgotten. Once there was a muffled  <i>thump</i>  as a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="533" height="22" font="2">blanket of snow slid from a roof and landed near them. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">“I don’t see your wolf,” Lannister said as they walked. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I chain him up in the old stables when we’re training. They board all the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">horses in the east stables now, so no one bothers him. The rest of the time he stays </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="478" height="22" font="2">with me. My sleeping cell is in Hardin’s Tower.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“That’s  the one with the broken battlement, no? Shattered stone in the yard </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">below, and a lean to it like our noble king Robert after a long night’s drinking? I </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">thought all those buildings had been abandoned.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jon shrugged. “No one cares where you sleep. Most of the old keeps are </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">empty, you can pick any cell you want.” Once Castle Black had housed five </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thousand fighting men with all their horses and servants and weapons. Now it was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="636" height="22" font="2">home to a tenth that number, and parts of it were falling into ruin. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister’s laughter steamed in the cold air. “I’ll be sure to tell your </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">father to arrest more stonemasons, before your tower collapses.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon could taste the mockery there, but there was no denying the truth. The </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Watch had built nineteen great strongholds along the Wall, but only three were still </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">occupied: Eastwatch on its grey windswept shore, the Shadow Tower hard by the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mountains where the Wall ended, and Castle Black between them, at the end of the </text>
</page>
<page number="149" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kingsroad. The other keeps, long deserted, were lonely, haunted places, where cold </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">winds whistled through black windows and the spirits of the dead manned the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">parapets. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It’s better that I’m by myself,” Jon said stubbornly. “The rest of them are </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">scared of Ghost.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Wise boys,” Lannister said. Then he changed the subject. “The talk is, your </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">uncle is too long away.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon remembered the wish he’d wished in his anger, the vision of Benjen Stark </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dead in the snow, and he looked away quickly. The dwarf had a way of sensing </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">things, and Jon did not want him to see the guilt in his eyes. “He said he’d be back </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">by my name day,” he admitted. His name day had come and gone, unremarked, a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fortnight past. “They were looking for Ser Waymar Royce, his father is bannerman </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to Lord Arryn. Uncle Benjen said they might search as far as the Shadow Tower. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">That’s all the way up in the mountains.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I hear that a good many rangers have vanished of late,” Lannister said as they </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">mounted the steps to the common hall. He grinned and pulled open the door. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps the grumkins are hungry this year.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Inside, the hall was immense and drafty, even with a fire roaring in its great </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">hearth. Crows nested in the timbers of its lofty ceiling. Jon heard their cries </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">overhead as he accepted a bowl of stew and a heel of black bread from the day’s </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cooks. Grenn and Toad and some of the others were seated at the bench nearest the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">warmth, laughing and cursing each other in rough voices. Jon eyed them </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thoughtfully for a moment. Then he chose a spot at the far end of the hall, well </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">away from the other diners. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister sat across from him, sniffing at the stew suspiciously. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“Barley, onion, carrot,” he muttered. “Someone should tell the cooks that turnip </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">isn’t a meat.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“It’s mutton stew.” Jon pulled off his gloves and warmed his hands in the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">steam rising from the bowl. The smell made his mouth water. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="88" height="22" font="2">“Snow.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon knew Alliser Thorne’s voice, but there was a curious note in it that he had </text>

<text top="942" left="108" width="472" height="22" font="2">“The Lord Commander wants to see you. Now.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">For a moment Jon was too frightened to move. Why would the Lord </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Commander want to see him? They had heard something about Benjen, he thought </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wildly, he was dead, the vision had come true. “Is it my uncle?” he blurted. “Is he </text>

<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Lord Commander is not accustomed to waiting,” was Ser Alliser’s reply. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="747" height="22" font="2">“And I am not accustomed to having my commands questioned by bastards.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister swung off the bench and rose. “Stop it, Thorne. You’re </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">frightening the boy.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Keep out of matters that don’t concern you, Lannister. You have no place </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">here.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I have a place at court, though,” the dwarf said, smiling. “A word in the right </text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ser Alliser said. “This is another matter entirely. A bird arrived this </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">morning from Winterfell, with a message that concerns his brother.” He corrected </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">himself. “His half brother.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Bran,” Jon breathed, scrambling to his feet. “Something’s happened to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">Bran.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="722" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister laid a hand on his arm. “Jon,” he said. “I am truly sorry.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon scarcely heard him. He brushed off Tyrion’s hand and strode across the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hall. He was running by the time he hit the doors. He raced to the Commander’s </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Keep, dashing through drifts of old snow. When the guards passed him, he took the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">tower steps two at a time. By the time he burst into the presence of the Lord </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Commander, his boots were soaked and Jon was wild-eyed and panting. “Bran,” he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="360" height="22" font="2">said. “What does it say about Bran?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jeor Mormont, Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, was a gruff old man </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with an immense bald head and a shaggy grey beard. He had a raven on his arm, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and he was feeding it kernels of corn. “I am told you can read.” He shook the raven </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">off, and it flapped its wings and flew to the window, where it sat watching as </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Mormont drew a roll of paper from his belt and handed it to Jon. “<i>Corn</i>,” it </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="416" height="22" font="2">muttered in a raucous voice. “<i>Corn</i>, <i>corn</i>.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon’s finger traced the outline of the direwolf in the white wax of the broken </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seat. He recognized Robb’s hand, but the letters seemed to blur and run as he tried </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to read them. He realized he was crying. And then, through the tears, he found the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sense in the words, and raised his head. “He woke up,” he said. “The gods gave him </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">back.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="690" height="22" font="2">“Crippled,” Mormont said. “I’m sorry, boy. Read the rest of the letter.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He looked at the words, but they didn’t matter. Nothing mattered. Bran was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">going to live. “My brother is going to live,” he told Mormont. The Lord </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Commander shook his head, gathered up a fistful of corn, and whistled. The raven </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">flew to his shoulder, crying, “<i>Live! Live!</i>” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon ran down the stairs, a smile on his face and Robb’s letter in his hand. “My </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother is going to live,” he told the guards. They exchanged a look. He ran back to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the common hall, where he found Tyrion Lannister just finishing his meal. He </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">grabbed the little man under the arms, hoisted him up in the air, and spun him </text>

<page number="151" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">around in a circle. “<i>Bran is going to live!</i>” he whooped. Lannister looked startled. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="752" height="22" font="2">Jon put him down and thrust the paper into his hands. “Here, read it,” he said. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Others were gathering around and looking at him curiously. Jon noticed Grenn </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a few feet away. A thick woolen bandage was wrapped around one hand. He looked </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">anxious and uncomfortable, not menacing at all. Jon went to him. Grenn edged </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="700" height="22" font="2">backward and put up his hands. “Stay away from me now, you bastard.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon smiled at him. “I’m sorry about your wrist. Robb used the same move on </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">me once, only with a wooden blade. It hurt like seven hells, but yours must be </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="607" height="22" font="2">worse. Look, if you want, I can show you how to defend that.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Alliser Thorne overheard him. “Lord Snow wants to take my place now.” He </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sneered. “I’d have an easier time teaching a wolf to juggle than you will training </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="138" height="22" font="2">this aurochs.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="720" height="22" font="2">“I’ll take that wager, Ser Alliser,” Jon said. “I’d love to see Ghost juggle.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="556" height="22" font="2">Jon heard Grenn suck in his breath, shocked. Silence fell. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Then Tyrion Lannister guffawed. Three of the black brothers joined in from a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nearby table. The laughter spread up and down the benches, until even the cooks </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">joined in. The birds stirred in the rafters, and finally even Grenn began to chuckle. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Alliser never took his eyes from Jon. As the laughter rolled around him, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his face darkened, and his sword hand curled into a fist. “That was a grievous error, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="559" height="22" font="2">Lord Snow,” he said at last in the acid tones of an enemy. </text>

<text top="290" left="122" width="748" height="22" font="2">tired, hungry, and irritable. He was still ahorse, dreaming of a long hot soak, </text>
<text top="318" left="122" width="749" height="22" font="2">a roast fowl, and a featherbed, when the king’s steward told him that Grand </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Maester Pycelle had convened an urgent meeting of the small council. The honor of </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">the Hand’s presence was requested as soon as it was convenient. “It will be </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="585" height="22" font="2">convenient on the morrow,” Ned snapped as he dismounted. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The steward bowed very low. “I shall give the councillors your regrets, my </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">lord.” </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No, damn it,” Ned said. It would not do to offend the council before he had </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">even begun. “I will see them. Pray give me a few moments to change into </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">something more presentable.” </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord,” the steward said. “We have given you Lord Arryn’s former </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chambers in the Tower of the Hand, if it please you. I shall have your things taken </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">there.” </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My thanks,” Ned said as he ripped off his riding gloves and tucked them into </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his belt. The rest of his household was coming through the gate behind him. Ned </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw Vayon Poole, his own steward, and called out. “It seems the council has urgent </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">need of me. See that my daughters find their bedchambers, and tell Jory to keep </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them there. Arya is not to go exploring.”Poole bowed. Ned turned back to the royal </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">steward. “My wagons are still straggling through the city. I shall need appropriate </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">garments.” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="463" height="22" font="2">“It will be my great pleasure,” the steward said. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">And so Ned had come striding into the council chambers, bone-tired and </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dressed in borrowed clothing, to find four members of the small council waiting for </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The chamber was richly furnished. Myrish carpets covered the floor instead of </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rushes, and in one corner a hundred fabulous beasts cavorted in bright paints on a </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">carved screen from the Summer Isles. The walls were hung with tapestries from </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Norvos and Qohor and Lys, and a pair of Valyrian sphinxes flanked the door, eyes </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="510" height="22" font="2">of polished garnet smoldering in black marble faces. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The councillor Ned liked least, the eunuch Varys, accosted him the moment </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">he entered. “Lord Stark, I was grievous sad to hear about your troubles on the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">kingsroad. We have all been visiting the sept to light candles for Prince Joffrey. I </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pray for his recovery.” His hand left powder stains on Ned’s sleeve, and he smelled </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">as foul and sweet as flowers on a grave. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your gods have heard you,” Ned replied, cool yet polite. “The prince grows </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stronger every day.” He disentangled himself from the eunuch’s grip and crossed </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the room to where Lord Renly stood by the screen, talking quietly with a short man </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">who could only be Littlefinger. Renly had been a boy of eight when Robert won the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">throne, but he had grown into a man so like his brother that Ned found it </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">disconcerting. Whenever he saw him, it was as if the years had slipped away and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="609" height="22" font="2">Robert stood before him, fresh from his victory on the Trident. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="538" height="22" font="2">“I see you have arrived safely, Lord Stark,” Renly said. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“And you as well,” Ned replied. “You must forgive me, but sometimes you </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">look the very image of your brother Robert.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="392" height="22" font="2">“A poor copy,” Renly said with a shrug. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Though much better dressed,” Littlefinger quipped. “Lord Renly spends </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">more on clothing than half the ladies of the court.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was true enough. Lord Renly was in dark green velvet, with a dozen golden </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stags embroidered on his doublet. A cloth-of-gold half cape was draped casually </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">across one shoulder, fastened with an emerald brooch. “There are worse crimes,” </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">Renly said with a laugh. “The way <i>you</i> dress, for one.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger ignored the jibe.  He eyed Ned with a smile on his lips that </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bordered on insolence. “I have hoped to meet you for some years, Lord Stark. No </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me to you.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“She has,” Ned replied with a chill in his voice. The sly arrogance of the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="749" height="22" font="2">comment rankled him. “I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="541" height="22" font="2">Renly Baratheon laughed. Varys shuffled over to listen. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Rather too well,” Littlefinger said. “I still carry a token of his esteem. Did </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">Brandon speak of me too?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Often, and with some heat,” Ned said, hoping that would end it. He had no </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">patience with this game they played, this dueling with words. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I should have thought that heat ill suits you Starks,” Littlefinger said. “Here </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the south, they say you are all made of ice, and melt when you ride below the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">Neck.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I do not plan on melting soon, Lord Baelish. You may count on it.” Ned </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">moved to the council table and said, “Maester Pycelle, I trust you are well.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Grand Maester smiled gently from his tall chair at the foot of the table. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Well enough for a man of my years, my lord,” he replied, “yet I do tire easily, I </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fear.” Wispy strands of white hair fringed the broad bald dome of his forehead </text>

<page number="154" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">above a kindly face. His maester’s collar was no simple metal choker such as Luwin </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wore, but two dozen heavy chains wound together into a ponderous metal necklace </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">that covered him from throat to breast. The links were forged of every metal known </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to man: black iron and red gold, bright copper and dull lead, steel and tin and pale </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">silver, brass and bronze and platinum. Garnets and amethysts and black pearls </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">adorned the metalwork, and here and there an emerald or ruby. “Perhaps we might </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">begin soon,” the Grand Maester said, hands knitting together atop his broad </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">stomach. “I fear I shall fall asleep if we wait much longer.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“As you will.” The king’s seat sat empty at the head of the table, the crowned </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stag of Baratheon embroidered in gold thread on its pillows. Ned took the chair </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beside it, as the right hand of his king. “My lords,” he said formally, “I am sorry to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">have kept you waiting.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“You are the King’s Hand,” Varys said. “We serve at your pleasure, Lord </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">Stark.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">As the others took their accustomed seats, it struck Eddard Stark forcefully </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that he did not belong here, in this room, with these men. He remembered what </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert had told him in the crypts below Winterfell.  <i>I am surrounded by flatterers </i></text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>and fools</i>, the king had insisted. Ned looked down the council table and wondered </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">which were the flatterers and which the fools. He thought he knew already. “We are </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="246" height="22" font="2">but five,” he pointed out. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Lord Stannis took himself to Dragonstone not long after the king went </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">north,” Varys said, “and our gallant Ser Barristan no doubt rides beside the king as </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">he makes his way through the city, as befits the Lord Commander of the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps we had best wait for Ser Barristan and the king to join us,” Ned </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">suggested. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Renly Baratheon laughed aloud. “If we wait for my brother to grace us with </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">his royal presence, it could be a long sit.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Our good King Robert has many cares,” Varys said. “He entrusts some small </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="330" height="22" font="2">matters to us, to lighten his load.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What Lord Varys means is that all this business of coin and crops and justice </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bores my royal brother to tears,” Lord Renly said, “so it falls to us to govern the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">realm. He does send us a command from time to time.” He drew a tightly rolled </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">paper from his sleeve and laid it on the table. “This morning he commanded me to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ride ahead with all haste and ask Grand Maester Pycelle to convene this council at </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">once. He has an urgent task for us.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger smiled and handed the paper to Ned. It bore the royal seal. Ned </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">broke the wax with his thumb and flattened the letter to consider the king’s urgent </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">command, reading the words with mounting disbelief. Was there no end to Robert’s </text>
</page>
<page number="155" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">folly? And to do this in <i>his</i> name, that was salt in the wound. “Gods be good,” he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">swore. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What Lord Eddard means to say,” Lord Renly announced, “is that His Grace </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">instructs us to stage a great tournament in honor of his appointment as the Hand of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">the King.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="401" height="22" font="2">“How much?” asked Littlefinger, mildly. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned read the answer off the letter. “Forty thousand golden dragons to the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">champion. Twenty thousand to the man who comes second, another twenty to the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="2">winner of the melee, and ten thousand to the victor of the archery competition.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ninety thousand gold pieces,” Littlefinger sighed. “And we must not neglect </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the other costs. Robert will want a prodigious feast. That means cooks, carpenters, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">serving girls, singers, jugglers, fools. . .” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="429" height="22" font="2">“Fools we have in plenty,” Lord Renly said. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Grand  Maester Pycelle looked to Littlefinger and asked, “Will the treasury </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">bear the expense?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What treasury is that?” Littlefinger replied with a twist of his mouth. “Spare </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">me the foolishness, Maester. You know as well as I that the treasury has been empty </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">for  years. I shall have to borrow the money. No doubt the Lannisters will be </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">accommodating. We owe Lord Tywin some three million dragons at present, what </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="344" height="22" font="2">matter another hundred thousand?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned was stunned. “Are you claiming that the Crown is  <i>three million</i>  gold </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">pieces in debt?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The Crown is more than  <i>six</i>  million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels. Of late I’ve had to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">turn to the Faith. The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned was aghast. “Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with gold. How </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">could you let this happen?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger gave a shrug. “The master of coin finds the money. The king and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">the Hand spend it.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I will not believe that Jon Arryn allowed Robert to beggar the realm,” Ned </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">said hotly. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle shook his great bald head, his chains clinking softly. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Lord Arryn was a prudent man, but I fear that His Grace does not always listen to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">wise counsel.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My royal brother loves tournaments and feasts,” Renly Baratheon said, “and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">he loathes what he calls ‘counting coppers.’” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I will speak with His Grace,” Ned said. “This tourney is an extravagance the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="212" height="22" font="2">realm cannot afford.” </text>
</page>
<page number="156" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Speak to  him as you will,” Lord Renly said, “we had still best make our </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">plans.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Another day,” Ned said. Perhaps too sharply, from the looks they gave him. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He would have to remember that he was no longer in Winterfell, where only the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">king stood higher; here, he was but first among equals. “Forgive me, my lords,” he </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said in a softer tone. “I am tired. Let us call a halt for today and resume when we </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">are fresher.” He did not ask for their consent, but stood abruptly, nodded at them all, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="224" height="22" font="2">and made for the door. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Outside, wagons and riders were still pouring through the castle gates, and the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">yard was a chaos of mud and horseflesh and shouting men. The king had not yet </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">arrived, he was told. Since the ugliness on the Trident, the Starks and their </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">household had ridden well ahead of the main column, the better to separate </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">themselves from the Lannisters and the growing tension. Robert had hardly been </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">seen; the talk was he was traveling in the huge wheelhouse, drunk as often as not. If </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">so, he might be hours behind, but he would still be here too soon for Ned’s liking. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He had only to look at Sansa’s face to feel the rage twisting inside him once again. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The last fortnight of their journey had been a misery. Sansa blamed Arya and told </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her that it should have been Nymeria who died. And Arya was lost after she heard </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">what had happened to her butcher’s boy. Sansa cried herself to sleep, Arya brooded </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">silently all day long, and Eddard Stark dreamed of a frozen hell reserved for the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">Starks of Winterfell. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He crossed the outer yard, passed under a portcullis into the inner bailey, and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was walking toward what he thought was the Tower of the Hand when Littlefinger </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="772" height="22" font="2">appeared in front of him. “You’re going the wrong way, Stark. Come with me.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Hesitantly, Ned followed. Littlefinger led him into a tower, down a stair, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">across a small sunken courtyard, and along a deserted corridor where empty suits of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">armor stood sentinel along the walls. They were relics of the Targaryens, black steel </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with dragon scales cresting their helms, now dusty and forgotten. “This is not the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">way to my chambers,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Did I say it was? I’m leading you to the dungeons to slit your throat and seal </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">your corpse up behind a wall,” Littlefinger replied, his voice dripping with sarcasm. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="511" height="22" font="2">“We have no time for this, Stark. Your wife awaits.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“What game are you playing, Littlefinger? Catelyn is at Winterfell, hundreds </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">of leagues from here.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Oh?” Littlefinger’s grey-green eyes glittered with amusement. “Then it </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">appears someone has managed an astonishing impersonation. For the last time, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">come. Or don’t come, and I’ll keep her for myself.” He hurried down the steps. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned followed him warily, wondering if this day would ever end. He had no </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">taste for these intrigues, but he was beginning to realize that they were meat and </text>
</page>
<page number="157" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="310" height="22" font="2">mead to a man like Littlefinger. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">At the foot of the steps was a heavy door of oak and iron. Petyr Baelish lifted </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the crossbar and gestured Ned through. They stepped out into the ruddy glow of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">dusk, on a rocky bluff high above the river. “We’re outside the castle,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You are a hard man to fool, Stark,” Littlefinger said with a smirk. “Was it the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sun that gave it away, or the sky? Follow me. There are niches cut in the rock. Try </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not to fall to your death, Catelyn would never understand.” With that, he was over </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="525" height="22" font="2">the side of the cliff, descending as quick as a monkey. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned studied the rocky face of the bluff for a moment, then followed more </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">slowly. The niches were there, as Littlefinger had promised, shallow cuts that would </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">be invisible from below, unless you knew just  where to look for them. The river </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was a long, dizzying distance below. Ned kept his face pressed to the rock and tried </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="468" height="22" font="2">not to look down any more often than he had to. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When at last he reached the bottom, a narrow, muddy trail along the water’s </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">edge, Littlefinger was lazing against a rock and eating an apple. He was almost </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down to the core. “You are growing old and slow, Stark,” he said, flipping the apple </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">casually into the rushing water. “No matter, we ride the rest of the way.” He had </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">two horses waiting. Ned mounted up and trotted behind him, down the trail and into </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">the city. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Finally Baelish drew rein in front of a ramshackle building, three stories, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">timbered, its windows bright with lamplight in the gathering dusk. The sounds of </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">music and raucous laughter drifted out and floated over the water. Beside the door </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="738" height="22" font="2">swung an ornate oil lamp on a heavy chain, with a globe of leaded red glass. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark dismounted in a fury. “A brothel,” he said as he seized Littlefinger </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">by the shoulder and spun him around. “You’ve brought me all this way to take me </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="132" height="22" font="2">to a brothel.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="383" height="22" font="2">“Your wife is inside,” Littlefinger said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">It was the final insult. “Brandon was too kind to you,” Ned said as he </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">slammed the small man back against a wall and shoved his dagger up under the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="2">little pointed chin beard. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My lord, <i>no</i>,” an urgent voice called out. “He speaks the truth.” There were </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">footsteps behind him. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned spun, knife in hand, as an old white-haired man hurried toward them. He </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was dressed in brown roughspun, and the soft flesh under his chin wobbled as he </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ran. “This is no business of yours,” Ned began; then, suddenly, the recognition </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">came. He lowered the dagger, astonished. “<i>Ser Rodrik?</i>” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="544" height="22" font="2">Rodrik Cassel nodded. “Your lady awaits you upstairs.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Ned was lost. “Catelyn is truly here? This is not some strange jape of </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="376" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger’s?” He sheathed his blade. </text>
</page>
<page number="158" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Would that it were, Stark,” Littlefinger said. “Follow me, and try to look a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shade more lecherous and a shade less like the King’s Hand. It would not do to have </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">you recognized. Perhaps you could fondle a breast or two, just in passing.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They went inside, through a crowded common room where a fat woman was </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">singing bawdy songs while pretty young girls in linen shifts and wisps of colored </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">silk pressed themselves against their lovers and dandled on their laps. No one paid </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Ned the least bit of attention. Ser Rodrik waited below while Littlefinger led him up </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">to the third floor, along a corridor, and through a door. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Inside, Catelyn was waiting. She cried out when she saw him, ran to him, and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="228" height="22" font="2">embraced him fiercely. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="421" height="22" font="2">“My lady,” Ned whispered in wonderment. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="726" height="22" font="2">“Oh, very good,” said Littlefinger, closing the door. “You recognized her.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I feared you’d never come, my lord,” she whispered against his chest. “Petyr </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">has been bringing me reports. He told me of your troubles with Arya and the young </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">prince. How are my girls?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Both in mourning, and full of anger,” he told her. “Cat, I do not understand. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">What are you doing in King’s Landing? What’s happened?” Ned asked his wife. “Is </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">it Bran? Is he. . .” <i>Dead </i>was the word that came to his lips, but he could not say it. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">“It is Bran, but not as you think,” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="737" height="22" font="2">Ned was lost. “Then how? Why are you here, my love? What is this place?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Just what it appears,” Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“A brothel. Can you think of a less likely place to find a Catelyn Tully?” He smiled. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="174" height="22" font="2">King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Why?” Ned asked. He saw her hands then, the awkward way she held them, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the raw red scars, the stiffness of the last two fingers on her left. “You’ve been </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hurt.” He took her hands in his own, turned them over. “Gods. Those are deep </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">cuts. . . a gash from a sword or. . . how did this happen, my lady?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn slid a dagger out from under her cloak and placed it in his hand. “This </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="610" height="22" font="2">blade was sent to open Bran’s throat and spill his life’s blood.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">Ned’s head jerked up. “But. . . who. . . why would. . .” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She put a finger to his lips. “Let me tell it all, my love. It will go faster that </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">way. Listen.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">So he listened, and she told it all, from the fire in the library tower to Varys </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and the guardsmen and Littlefinger. And when she was done, Eddard Stark sat </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dazed beside the table, the dagger in his hand. Bran’s wolf had saved the boy’s life, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he thought dully. What was it that Jon had said when they found the pups in the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">snow?  <i>Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord</i>.  And he had killed </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa’s, and for what? Was it guilt he was feeling? Or fear? If the gods had sent </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">these wolves, what folly had he done? </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Painfully, Ned forced his thoughts back to the dagger and what it meant. “The </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Imp’s dagger,” he repeated. It made no sense. His hand curled around the smooth </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dragonbone hilt, and he slammed the blade into the table, felt it bite into the wood. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">It stood mocking him. “Why should Tyrion Lannister want Bran dead? The boy has </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">never done him harm.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Do you Starks have nought but snow between your ears?” Littlefinger asked. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">“The Imp would never have acted alone.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned rose and paced the length of the room. “If the queen had a role in this or, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gods forbid, the king himself. . . no, I will not believe that.” Yet even as he said the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">words, he remembered that chill morning on the barrowlands, and Robert’s talk of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sending hired knives after the Targaryen princess. He remembered Rhaegar’s infant </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">son, the red ruin of his skull, and the way the king had turned away, as he had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">turned away in Darry’s audience hall not so long ago. He could still hear Sansa </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">pleading, as Lyanna had pleaded once. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Most likely the king did  <i>not</i>  know,” Littlefinger said. “It would not be the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">first time. Our good Robert is practiced at closing his eyes to things he would rather </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">not see.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned had no reply for that. The face of the butcher’s boy swam up before his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eyes, cloven almost in two, and afterward the king had said not a word. His head </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">was pounding. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger sauntered over to the table, wrenched the knife from the wood. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“The accusation is treason either way. Accuse the king and you will dance with Ilyn </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Payne before the words are out of your mouth. The queen. . . <i>if </i>you can find proof, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="509" height="22" font="2">and <i>if </i> you can make Robert listen, then perhaps. . .” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="497" height="22" font="2">“We have proof,” Ned said. “We have the dagger.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“This?” Littlefinger flipped the knife casually end over end. “A sweet piece of </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">steel, but it cuts two ways, my lord. The Imp will no doubt swear the blade was lost </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">or stolen while he was at Winterfell, and with his hireling dead, who is there to give </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him the lie?” He tossed the knife lightly to Ned. “My counsel is to drop that in the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">river and forget that it was ever forged.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned regarded him coldly. “Lord Baelish, I am a Stark of Winterfell. My son </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lies crippled, perhaps dying. He would be dead, and Catelyn with him, but for a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wolf pup we found in the snow. If you truly believe I could forget that, you are as </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="617" height="22" font="2">big a fool now as when you took up sword against my brother.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A fool I may be, Stark. . . yet I’m still here, while your brother has been </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moldering in his frozen grave for some fourteen years now. If you are so eager to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">molder beside him, far be it from me to dissuade you, but I would rather not be </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="436" height="22" font="2">included in the party, thank you very much.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You would be the last man I would willingly include in any party, Lord </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">Baelish.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You wound me deeply.” Littlefinger placed a hand over his heart. “For my </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">part, I always found you Starks a tiresome lot, but Cat seems to have become </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">attached to you, for reasons I cannot comprehend. I shall try to keep you alive for </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="2">her sake. A fool’s task, admittedly, but I could never refuse your wife anything.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I told Petyr our suspicions about Jon Arryn’s death,” Catelyn said. “He has </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">promised to help you find the truth.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That was not news that Eddard Stark welcomed, but it was true enough that </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they needed help, and Littlefinger had been almost a brother to Cat once. It would </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">despised. “Very well,” he said, thrusting the dagger into his belt. “You spoke of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">Varys. Does the eunuch know all of it?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Not from my lips,” Catelyn said. “You did not wed a fool, Eddard Stark. But </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Varys has ways of learning things that no man could know. He has some dark art, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="164" height="22" font="2">Ned, I swear it.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="552" height="22" font="2">“He has spies, that is well known,” Ned said, dismissive. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“It  is more than that,” Catelyn insisted. “Ser Rodrik spoke to Ser Aron </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Santagar in all secrecy, yet somehow the Spider knew of their conversation. I fear </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">that man.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger smiled. “Leave Lord Varys to me, sweet lady. If you will permit </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">me a small obscenity—and where better for it—I hold the man’s balls in the palm </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of my hand.” He cupped his fingers, smiling. “Or would, if he were a man, or had </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">any balls. You see, if the pie is opened, the birds begin to sing, and Varys would not </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">like that. Were I you, I would worry more about the Lannisters and less about the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">eunuch.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned did not need Littlefinger to tell him that. He was thinking back to the day </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Arya had been found, to the look on the queen’s face when she said,  <i>We have a </i></text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>wolf</i>, so soft and quiet. He was thinking of the boy Mycah, of Jon Arryn’s sudden </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">death, of Bran’s fall, of old mad Aerys Targaryen dying on the floor of his throne </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">room while his life’s blood dried on a golden blade. “My lady,” he said, turning to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Catelyn, “there is nothing more you can do here. I want you to return to Winterfell </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at once. If there was one assassin, there could be others. Whoever ordered Bran’s </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">death will learn soon enough that the boy still lives.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="447" height="22" font="2">“I had hoped to see the girls. . .” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“That would be most unwise,” Littlefinger put in. “The Red Keep is full of </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="315" height="22" font="2">curious eyes, and children talk.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He speaks truly, my love,” Ned told her. He embraced her. “Take Ser Rodrik </text>
</page>
<page number="161" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and ride for Winterfell. I will watch over the girls. Go home to our sons and keep </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">them safe.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lord.” Catelyn lifted her face, and Ned kissed her. Her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">maimed fingers clutched against his back with a desperate strength, as if to hold </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="415" height="22" font="2">him safe forever in the shelter of her arms. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Would the lord and lady like the use of a bedchamber?” asked Littlefinger. “I </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="750" height="22" font="2">should warn you, Stark, we usually charge for that sort of thing around here.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="472" height="22" font="2">“A moment alone, that’s all I ask,” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Very well.” Littlefinger strolled to the door. “Don’t be too long. It is past </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="695" height="22" font="2">time the Hand and I returned to the castle, before our absence is noted.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn went to him and took his hands in her own. “I will not forget the help </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you gave me, Petyr. When your men came for me, I did not know whether they </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">were taking me to a friend or an enemy. I have found you more than a friend. I have </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="325" height="22" font="2">found a brother I’d thought lost.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Petyr Baelish smiled. “I am desperately sentimental, sweet lady. Best not tell </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">anyone. I have spent years convincing the court that I am wicked and cruel, and I </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">should hate to see all that hard work go for naught.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned believed not a word of that, but he kept his voice polite as he said, “You </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">have my thanks as well, Lord Baelish.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">“Oh, now <i>there’s</i> a treasure,” Littlefinger said, exiting. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When the door had closed behind him, Ned turned back to his wife. “Once </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you are home, send word to Helman Tallhart and Galbart Glover under my seal. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">They are to raise a hundred bowmen each and fortify Moat Cailin. Two hundred </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">determined archers can hold the Neck against an army. Instruct Lord Manderly that </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he is to strengthen and repair all his defenses at White Harbor, and see that they are </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">well manned. And from this day on, I want a careful watch kept over Theon </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="675" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy. If there is war, we shall have sore need of his father’s fleet.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="444" height="22" font="2">“<i>War?</i>” The fear was plain on Catelyn’s face. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It will not come to that,” Ned promised her, praying it was true. He took her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in his arms again. “The Lannisters are merciless in the face of weakness, as Aerys </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Targaryen learned to his sorrow, but they would not dare attack the north without </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">all the power of the realm behind them, and that they shall not have. I must play out </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">this fool’s masquerade as if nothing is amiss. Remember why I came here, my love. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="563" height="22" font="2">If I find proof that the Lannisters murdered Jon Arryn. . .” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He felt Catelyn tremble in his arms. Her scarred hands clung to him. “If,” she </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">said, “what then, my love?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">That was the most dangerous part, Ned knew. “All justice flows from the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">king,” he told her. “When I know the truth, I must go to Robert.” <i>And pray that he </i></text>

<text top="318" left="236" width="643" height="22" font="2">“Past certain, Lord Mormont,” Tyrion replied. “My brother </text>

<text top="400" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Would that I could.” Mormont picked up a crab claw and cracked it in his </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fist. Old as he was, the Lord Commander still had the strength of a bear. “You’re a </text>

<text top="483" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion grinned. “Then I shall scour the Seven Kingdoms for dwarfs and ship </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them all to you, Lord Mormont.” As they laughed, he sucked the meat from a crab </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">leg and reached for another. The crabs had arrived from Eastwatch only this </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">morning, packed in a barrel of snow, and they were succulent. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Alliser Thorne was the only man at table who did not so much as crack a </text>

<text top="649" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Only you, Ser Alliser,” Tyrion said. This time the laughter round the table </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">had a nervous, uncertain quality to it. </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Thorne’s black eyes fixed on Tyrion with loathing. “You have a bold tongue </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">for someone who is less than half a man. Perhaps you and I should visit the yard </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">together.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="432" height="22" font="2">“Why?” asked Tyrion. “The crabs are here.” </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The remark brought more guffaws from the others. Ser Alliser stood up, his </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">mouth a tight line. “Come and make your japes with steel in your hand.” </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion looked pointedly at his right hand. “Why, I <i>have</i> steel in my hand, Ser </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Alliser, although it appears to be a crab fork. Shall we duel?” He hopped up on his </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chair and began poking at Thorne’s chest with the tiny fork. Roars of laughter filled </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the tower room. Bits of crab flew from the Lord Commander’s mouth as he began </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to gasp and choke. Even his raven joined in, cawing loudly from above the window. </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">“<i>Duel! Duel! Duel!</i>” </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Alliser Thorne walked from the room so stiffly it looked as though he had </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">a dagger up his butt. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mormont was still gasping for breath. Tyrion pounded him on the back. “To </text>

<page number="163" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">the victor goes the spoils,” he called out. “I claim Thorne’s share of the crabs.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Finally the Lord Commander recovered himself. “You are a wicked man, to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="390" height="22" font="2">provoke our Ser Alliser so,” he scolded. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion seated himself and took a sip of wine. “If a man paints a target on his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">chest, he should expect that sooner or later someone will loose an arrow at him. I </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="594" height="22" font="2">have seen dead men with more humor than your Ser Alliser.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Not so,” objected the Lord Steward, Bowen Marsh, a man as round and red </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">as a pomegranate. “You ought to hear the droll names he gives the lads he trains.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion had heard a few of those droll names. “I’ll wager the lads have a few </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">names for him as well,” he said. “Chip the ice off your eyes, my good lords. Ser </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Alliser Thorne should be mucking out your stables, not drilling your young </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">warriors.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,” Lord Mormont grumbled. “That </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seems to be all they send us these days. Stableboys and sneak thieves and rapers. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Ser Alliser is an anointed knight, one of the few to take the black since I have been </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="561" height="22" font="2">Lord Commander. He fought bravely at King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“On the wrong side,” Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. “I ought to know, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">I was there on the battlements beside him. Tywin Lannister gave us a splendid </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before evenfall. No offense </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">intended, Tyrion.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“None taken, Ser Jaremy. My father is very fond of spiked heads, especially </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">those of people who have annoyed him in some fashion. And a face as noble as </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">yours, well, no doubt he saw you decorating the city wall above the King’s Gate. I </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="514" height="22" font="2">think you would have looked very striking up there.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="539" height="22" font="2">“Thank you,” Ser Jaremy replied with a sardonic smile. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Commander Mormont cleared his throat. “Sometimes I fear Ser Alliser </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">saw you true, Tyrion. You <i>do</i> mock us and our noble purpose here.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Tyrion shrugged. “We all need to be mocked from time to time, Lord </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Mormont, lest we start to take ourselves too seriously. More wine, please.” He held </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">out his cup. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As Rykker filled it for him, Bowen Marsh said, “You have a great thirst for a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="122" height="22" font="2">small man.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I think that Lord Tyrion is quite a large man,” Maester Aemon said from </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the far end of the table. He spoke softly, yet the high officers of the Night’s Watch </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">all fell quiet, the better to hear what the ancient had to say. “I think he is a giant </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="449" height="22" font="2">come among us, here at the end of the world.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion answered gently, “I’ve been called many things, my lord, but <i>giant</i> is </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">seldom one of them.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Nonetheless,” Maester Aemon said as his clouded, milk-white eyes moved to </text>
</page>
<page number="164" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s face, “I think it is true.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">For once, Tyrion Lannister found himself at a loss for words. He could only </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">bow his head politely and say, “You are too kind, Maester Aemon.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The blind man smiled. He was a tiny thing, wrinkled and hairless, shrunken </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beneath the weight of a hundred years so his maester’s collar with its links of many </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">metals hung loose about his throat. “I have been called many things, my lord,” he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="788" height="22" font="2">said, “but <i>kind</i> is seldom one of them.” This time Tyrion himself led the laughter. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Much later, when the serious business of eating was done and the others had </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">left, Mormont offered Tyrion a chair beside the fire and a cup of mulled spirits so </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">strong they brought tears to his eyes. “The kingsroad can be perilous this far north,” </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">the Lord Commander told him as they drank. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="717" height="22" font="2">“I have Jyck and Morrec,” Tyrion said, “and Yoren is riding south again.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yoren is only one man. The Watch shall escort you as far as Winterfell,” </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Mormont announced in a tone that brooked no argument. “Three men should be </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">sufficient.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“If you insist, my lord,” Tyrion said. “You might send young Snow. He would </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="396" height="22" font="2">be glad for a chance to see his brothers.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Mormont frowned through his thick grey beard. “Snow? Oh, the Stark bastard. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">I think not. The young ones need to forget the lives they left behind them, the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brothers and mothers and all that. A visit home would only stir up feelings best left </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">alone. I know these things. My own blood kin. . . my sister Maege rules Bear Island </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">now, since my son’s dishonor. I have nieces I have never seen.” He took a swallow. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Besides, Jon Snow is only a boy. You shall have three strong swords, to keep you </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">safe.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“I am touched by your concern, Lord Mormont.” The strong drink was </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">making Tyrion light-headed, but not so drunk that he did not realize that the Old </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="681" height="22" font="2">Bear wanted something from him. “I hope I can repay your kindness.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You can,” Mormont said bluntly. “Your sister sits beside the king. Your </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">brother is a great knight, and your father the most powerful lord in the Seven </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Kingdoms. Speak to them for us. Tell them of our need here. You have seen for </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">yourself, my lord. The Night’s Watch is dying. Our strength is less than a thousand </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">now. Six hundred here, two hundred in the Shadow Tower,  even fewer at </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Eastwatch, and a scant third of those fighting men. The Wall is a hundred leagues </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">long. Think on that. Should an attack come, I have three men to defend each mile of </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">wall.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="443" height="22" font="2">“Three and a third,” Tyrion said with a yawn. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Mormont scarcely seemed to hear him. The old man warmed his hands before </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the fire. “I sent Benjen Stark to search after Yohn Royce’s son, lost on his first </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ranging. The Royce boy was green as summer grass, yet he insisted on the honor of </text>

<page number="165" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his own command, saying it was his due as a knight. I did not wish to offend his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lord father, so I yielded. I sent him out with two men I deemed as good as any in the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">Watch. More fool I.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>Fool</i>,” the raven agreed. Tyrion glanced up. The bird peered down at him </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with those beady black eyes, ruffling its wings. “<i>Fool</i>,” it called again. Doubtless </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">old Mormont would take it amiss if he throttled the creature. A pity. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Lord Commander took no notice of the irritating bird. “Gared was near as </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">old as I am and longer on the Wall,” he went on, “yet it would seem he forswore </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">himself and fled. I should never have believed it, not of him, but Lord Eddard sent </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">me his head from Winterfell. Of Royce, there is no word. One deserter and two men </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lost, and now Ben Stark too has gone missing.” He sighed deeply. “Who am I to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">send searching after <i>him</i>? In two years I will be seventy. Too old and too weary for </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the burden I bear, yet if I set it down, who will pick it up? Alliser Thorne? Bowen </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Marsh? I would have to be as blind as Maester Aemon not to see what <i>they</i> are. The </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Night’s Watch has become an army of sullen boys and tired old men. Apart from </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the men at my table tonight, I have perhaps twenty who can read, and even fewer </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">who can think, or plan, or  <i>lead</i>.  Once the Watch spent its summers building, and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">each Lord Commander raised the Wall higher than he found it. Now it is all we can </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="169" height="22" font="2">do to stay alive.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He was in deadly earnest, Tyrion realized. He felt faintly embarrassed for the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">old man. Lord Mormont had spent a good part of his life on the Wall, and he needed </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to believe if those years were to have any meaning. “I promise, the king will hear of </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">your need,” Tyrion said gravely, “and I will speak to my father and my brother </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Jaime as well.” And he would. Tyrion Lannister was as good as his word. He left </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the rest unsaid; that King Robert would ignore him, Lord Tywin would ask if he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">had taken leave of his senses, and Jaime would only laugh. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You are a young man, Tyrion,” Mormont said. “How many winters have you </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">seen?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="2">He shrugged. “Eight, nine. I misremember.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="239" height="22" font="2">“And all of them short.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lord.” He had been born in the dead of winter, a terrible cruel </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">one that the maesters said had lasted near three years, but Tyrion’s earliest </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">memories were of spring. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“When I was a boy, it was said that a long summer always meant a long </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">winter to come. This summer has lasted <i>nine years</i>, Tyrion, and a tenth will soon be </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">upon us. Think on that.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“When <i>I</i> was a boy,” Tyrion replied, “my wet nurse told me that one day, if </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">men were good, the gods would give the world a summer without ending. Perhaps </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">we’ve been better than we thought, and the Great Summer is finally at hand.” He </text>

<page number="166" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">grinned. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The Lord Commander did not seem amused. “You are not fool enough to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no mistake, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord with his own. The end of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">summer stares us in the face.” Mormont reached out and clutched Tyrion tightly by </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the hand. “You must  <i>make</i>  them understand. I tell you, my lord, the darkness is </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">coming. There are wild things in the woods, direwolves and mammoths and snow </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">bears the size of aurochs, and I have seen darker shapes in my dreams.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“In your dreams,” Tyrion echoed, thinking how badly he needed another </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">strong drink. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Mormont was deaf to the edge in his voice. “The fisherfolk near Eastwatch </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">have glimpsed white walkers on the shore.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">This time Tyrion could not hold his tongue. “The fisherfolk of Lannisport </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">often glimpse merlings.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Denys Mallister writes that the mountain people are moving south, slipping </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">past the Shadow Tower in numbers greater than ever before. They are running, my </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lord. . . but running from  <i>what</i>?” Lord Mormont moved to the window and stared </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">out into the night. “These are old bones, Lannister, but they have never felt a chill </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">like this. Tell the king what I say, I pray you. Winter<i> is</i> coming, and when the Long </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Night falls, only the Night’s Watch will stand between the realm and the darkness </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="670" height="22" font="2">that sweeps from the north. The gods help us all if we are not ready.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The gods help <i>me</i> if I do not get some sleep tonight. Yoren is determined to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ride at first light.” Tyrion got to his feet, sleepy from wine and tired of doom. “I </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="656" height="22" font="2">thank you for all the courtesies you have done me, Lord Mormont.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Tell them, Tyrion. Tell them and make them believe. That is all the thanks I </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">need.” He whistled, and his raven flew to him and perched on his shoulder. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Mormont smiled and gave the bird some corn from his pocket, and that was how </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">Tyrion left him. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was bitter cold outside. Bundled thickly in his furs, Tyrion Lannister pulled </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on his gloves and nodded to the poor frozen wretches standing sentry outside the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Commander’s Keep. He set off across the yard for his own chambers in the King’s </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Tower, walking as briskly as his legs could manage. Patches of snow crunched </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beneath his feet as his boots broke the night’s crust, and his breath steamed before </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him like a banner. He shoved his hands into his armpits and walked faster, praying </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">that Morrec had remembered to warm his bed with hot bricks from the fire. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Behind the King’s Tower, the Wall glimmered in the light of the moon, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">immense and mysterious. Tyrion stopped for a moment to look up at it. His legs </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">ached of cold and haste. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Suddenly a strange madness took hold of him, a yearning to look once more </text>
</page>
<page number="167" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">off the end of the world. It would be his last chance, he thought; tomorrow he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">would ride south, and he could not imagine why he would ever want to return to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">this frozen desolation. The King’s Tower was before him, with its promise of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">warmth and a soft bed, yet Tyrion found himself walking past it, toward the vast </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">pale palisade of the Wall. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A wooden stair ascended the south face, anchored on huge rough-hewn beams </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sunk deep into the ice and frozen in place. Back and forth it switched, clawing its </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">way upward as crooked as a bolt of lightning. The black brothers assured him that it </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was much stronger than it looked, but Tyrion’s legs were cramping too badly for </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">him to even contemplate the ascent. He went instead to the iron cage beside the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="727" height="22" font="2">well, clambered inside, and yanked hard on the bell rope, three quick pulls. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He had to wait what seemed an eternity, standing there inside the bars with the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Wall to his back. Long enough for Tyrion to begin to wonder why he was doing </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">this. He had just about decided to forget his sudden whim and go to bed when the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="367" height="22" font="2">cage gave a jerk and began to ascend. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He moved upward slowly, by fits and starts at first, then more smoothly. The </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">ground fell away beneath him, the cage swung, and Tyrion wrapped his hands </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">around the iron bars. He could feel the cold of the metal even through his gloves. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Morrec had a fire burning in his room, he noted with approval, but the Lord </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="813" height="22" font="2">Commander’s tower was dark. The Old Bear had more sense than he did, it seemed. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Then he was above the towers, still inching his way upward. Castle Black lay </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">below him, etched in moonlight. You could see how stark and empty it was from up </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">here; windowless keeps, crumbling walls, courtyards choked with broken stone. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Farther off, he could see the lights of Mole’s Town, the little village half a league </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">south along the kingsroad, and here and there the bright glitter of moonlight on </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">water where icy streams descended from the mountain heights to cut across the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">plains. The rest of the world was a bleak emptiness of windswept hills and rocky </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="246" height="22" font="2">fields spotted with snow. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Finally a thick voice behind him said, “Seven hells, it’s the dwarf,” and the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cage jerked to a sudden stop and hung there, swinging slowly back and forth, the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="153" height="22" font="2">ropes creaking. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Bring him in, damn it.” There was a grunt and a loud groaning of wood as </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the cage slid sideways and then the Wall was beneath him. Tyrion waited until the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swinging had stopped before he pushed open the cage door and hopped down onto </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the ice. A heavy figure in black was leaning on the winch, while a second held the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cage with a gloved hand. Their faces were muffled in woolen scarves so only their </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes showed, and they were plump with layers of wool and leather, black on black. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="779" height="22" font="2">“And what will you be wanting, this time of night?” the one by the winch asked. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="139" height="22" font="2">“A last look.” </text>
</page>
<page number="168" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The men exchanged sour glances. “Look all you want,” the other one said. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Just have a care you don’t fall off, little man. The Old Bear would have our hides.” </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">A small wooden shack stood under the great crane, and Tyrion saw the dull glow of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a brazier and felt a brief gust of warmth when the winch men opened the door and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="404" height="22" font="2">went back inside. And then he was alone. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was bitingly cold up here, and the wind pulled at his clothes like an insistent </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lover. The top of the Wall was wider than the kingsroad often was, so Tyrion had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">no fear of falling, although the footing was  slicker than he would have liked. The </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">brothers spread crushed stone across the walkways, but the weight of countless </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">footsteps would melt the Wall beneath, so the ice would seem to grow around the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gravel, swallowing it, until the path was bare again and it was time to crush more </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">stone. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Still, it was nothing that Tyrion could not manage. He looked off to the east </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and west, at the Wall stretching before him, a vast white road with no beginning and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">no end and a dark abyss on either side. West, he decided, for no special reason, and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he began to walk that way, following the pathway nearest the north edge, where the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="224" height="22" font="2">gravel looked freshest. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">His bare cheeks were ruddy with the cold, and his legs complained more </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">loudly with every step, but Tyrion ignored them. The wind swirled around him, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gravel crunched beneath his boots, while ahead the white ribbon followed the lines </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the hills, rising higher and higher, until it was lost beyond the western horizon. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He passed a massive catapult, as tall as a city wall, its base sunk deep into the Wall. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The throwing arm had been taken off for repairs and then forgotten; it lay there like </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">a broken toy, half-embedded in the ice. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">On the far side of the catapult, a muffled voice called out a challenge. “Who </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="181" height="22" font="2">goes there? Halt!” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion stopped. “If I halt too long I’ll freeze in place, Jon,” he said as a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="790" height="22" font="2">shaggy pale shape slid toward him silently and sniffed at his furs. “Hello, Ghost.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow moved closer. He looked bigger and heavier in his layers of fur and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">leather, the hood of his cloak pulled down over his face. “Lannister,” he said, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">yanking loose the scarf to uncover his mouth. “This is the last place I would have </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">expected to see you.” He carried a heavy spear tipped in iron, taller than he was, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and a sword hung at his side in a leather sheath. Across his chest was a gleaming </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">black warhorn, banded with silver. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“This is the last place I would have expected to be seen,” Tyrion admitted. “I </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="683" height="22" font="2">was captured by a whim. If I touch Ghost, will he chew my hand off?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="341" height="22" font="2">“Not with me here,” Jon promised. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion scratched the white wolf behind the ears. The red eyes watched him </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">impassively. The beast came up as high as his chest now. Another year, and Tyrion </text>

<page number="169" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had the gloomy feeling he’d be looking  <i>up</i>  at him. “What are  <i>you</i>  doing up here </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="592" height="22" font="2">tonight?” he asked. “Besides freezing your manhood off . . .” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I have drawn night guard,” Jon said. “Again. Ser Alliser has kindly arranged </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for the watch commander to take a special interest in me. He seems to think that if </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">they keep me awake half the night, I’ll fall asleep during morning drill. So far I </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="240" height="22" font="2">have disappointed him.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="540" height="22" font="2">Tyrion grinned. “And has Ghost learned to juggle yet?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No,” said Jon, smiling, “but Grenn held his own against Halder this morning, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="639" height="22" font="2">and Pyp is no longer dropping his sword quite so often as he did.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="75" height="22" font="2">“Pyp?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Pypar is his real name. The small boy with the large ears. He saw me </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">working with Grenn and asked for help. Thorne had never even shown him the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">proper way to grip a sword.” He turned to look north. “I have a mile of Wall to </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="315" height="22" font="2">guard. Will you walk with me?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="336" height="22" font="2">“If you walk slowly,” Tyrion said. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The watch commander tells me I must walk, to keep my blood from freezing, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">but he never said how fast.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">They walked, with Ghost pacing along beside Jon like a white shadow. “I </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">leave on the morrow,” Tyrion said. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="364" height="22" font="2">“I know.” Jon sounded strangely sad. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I plan to stop at Winterfell on the way south. If there is any message that you </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">would like me to deliver. . .” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Tell Robb that I’m going to command the Night’s Watch and keep him safe, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">so he might as well take up needlework with the girls and have Mikken melt down </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">his sword for horseshoes.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Your brother is bigger than me,” Tyrion said with a laugh. “I decline to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">deliver any message that might get me killed.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Rickon will ask when I’m coming home. Try to explain where I’ve gone, if </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="739" height="22" font="2">you can. Tell him he can have all my things while I’m away, he’ll like that.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">People seemed to be asking a great deal of him today, Tyrion Lannister </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="531" height="22" font="2">thought. “You could put all this in a letter, you know.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Rickon can’t read yet. Bran. . .”  He stopped suddenly. “I don’t know what </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">message to send to Bran. Help him, Tyrion.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“What help could I give him? I am no maester, to ease his pain. I have no </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="323" height="22" font="2">spells to give him back his legs.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="524" height="22" font="2">“You gave me help when I needed it,” Jon Snow said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="433" height="22" font="2">“I gave you nothing,” Tyrion said. “Words.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="358" height="22" font="2">“Then give your words to Bran too.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“You’re asking a lame man to teach a cripple how to dance,” Tyrion said. </text>
</page>
<page number="170" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“However sincere the lesson, the result is likely to be grotesque. Still, I know what </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">it is to love a brother, Lord Snow. I will give Bran whatever small help is in my </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">power.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, my lord of Lannister.” He pulled off his glove and offered his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="202" height="22" font="2">bare hand. “Friend.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion found himself oddly touched. “Most of my kin are bastards,” he said </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a wry smile, “but  you’re the first I’ve had to friend.” He pulled a glove off </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with his teeth and clasped Snow by the hand, flesh against flesh. The boy’s grip was </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="160" height="22" font="2">firm and strong. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">When he had donned his glove again, Jon Snow turned abruptly and walked to </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the low, icy northern parapet. Beyond him the Wall fell away sharply; beyond him </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">there was only the darkness and the wild. Tyrion followed him, and side by side </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="375" height="22" font="2">they stood upon the edge of the world. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Night’s Watch permitted the forest to come no closer than half a mile of </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the north face of the Wall. The thickets of ironwood and sentinel and oak that had </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">once grown there had been harvested centuries ago, to create a broad swath of open </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ground through which no enemy could hope to pass unseen. Tyrion had heard that </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">elsewhere along the Wall, between the three fortresses, the wildwood had come </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">creeping back over the decades, that there were places where grey-green sentinels </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and pale white weirwoods had taken root in the shadow of the Wall itself, but </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Castle Black had a prodigious appetite for firewood, and here the forest was still </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">kept at bay by the axes of the black brothers. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was never far, though. From up here Tyrion could see it, the dark trees </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looming beyond the stretch of open ground, like a second wall built parallel to the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">first, a wall of night. Few axes had ever swung in <i>that</i> black wood, where even the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">moonlight could not penetrate the ancient tangle of root and thorn and grasping </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">limb. Out there the trees grew huge, and the rangers said they seemed to brood and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="803" height="22" font="2">knew not men. It was small wonder the Night’s Watch named it the haunted forest. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">As he stood there and looked at all that darkness with no fires burning </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">anywhere, with the wind blowing and the cold like a spear in his guts, Tyrion </text>

<text top="290" left="135" width="737" height="22" font="2">face when he came to table, late again, as he had been so often. The first </text>
<text top="318" left="135" width="739" height="22" font="2">course, a thick sweet soup made with pumpkins, had already been taken </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">away when Ned Stark strode into the Small Hall. They called it that to set it apart </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from the Great Hall, where the king could feast a thousand, but it was a long room </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="770" height="22" font="2">with a high vaulted ceiling and bench space for two hundred at its trestle tables. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My lord,” Jory said when Father entered. He rose to his feet, and the rest of </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the guard rose with him. Each man wore a new cloak, heavy grey wool with a white </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">satin border. A hand of beaten silver clutched the woolen folds of each cloak and </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">marked their wearers as men of the Hand’s household guard. There were only fifty </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">of them, so most of the benches were empty. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Be seated,” Eddard Stark said. “I see you have started without me. I am </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pleased to know there are still some men of sense in this city.” He signaled for the </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">meal to resume. The servants began bringing out platters of ribs, roasted in a crust </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">of garlic and herbs. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The talk in the yard is we shall have a tourney, my lord,” Jory said as he </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">resumed his seat. “They say that knights will come from all over the realm to joust </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="596" height="22" font="2">and feast in honor of your appointment as Hand of the King.” </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya could see that her father was not very happy about that. “Do they also </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="579" height="22" font="2">say this is the last thing in the world I would have wished?” </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa’s eyes had grown wide as the plates. “A  <i>tourney</i>,” she breathed. She </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was seated between Septa Mordane and Jeyne Poole, as far from Arya as she could </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="801" height="22" font="2">get without drawing a reproach from Father. “Will we be permitted to go, Father?” </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You know my feelings, Sansa. It seems I must arrange Robert’s games and </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pretend to be honored for his sake. That does not mean I must subject my daughters </text>

<text top="980" left="108" width="404" height="22" font="2">“Oh, <i>please</i>,” Sansa said. “I want to see.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane spoke up. “Princess Myrcella will be there, my lord, and her </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Father looked pained. “I suppose so. Very well, I shall arrange a place for you, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">Sansa.” He saw Arya. “For both of you.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I don’t care about their stupid tourney,” Arya said. She knew Prince Joffrey </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">would be there, and she hated Prince Joffrey. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="717" height="22" font="2">Sansa lifted her head. “It will be a <i>splendid</i> event. You shan’t be wanted.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Anger flashed across Father’s face. “<i>Enough</i>, Sansa. More of that and you will </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">change my mind. I am weary unto death of this endless war you two are fighting. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="690" height="22" font="2">You are sisters. I expect you to behave like sisters, is that understood?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa bit her lip and nodded. Arya lowered her face to stare sullenly at her </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">plate. She could feel tears stinging her eyes. She rubbed them away angrily, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="218" height="22" font="2">determined not to cry. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The only sound was the clatter of knives and forks. “Pray excuse me,” her </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">father announced to the table. “I find I have small appetite tonight.” He walked </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">from the hall. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">After he was gone, Sansa exchanged excited whispers with Jeyne Poole. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Down the table Jory laughed at a joke, and Hullen started in about horseflesh. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Your warhorse, now, he may not be the best one for the joust. Not the same thing, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">oh, no, not the same at all.” The men had heard it all before; Desmond, Jacks, and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="808" height="22" font="2">Hullen’s son Harwin shouted him down together, and Porther called for more wine. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">No one talked to Arya. She didn’t care. She liked it that way. She would have </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eaten her meals alone in her bedchamber if they let her. Sometimes they did, when </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Father had to dine with the king or some lord or the envoys from this place or that </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">place. The rest of the time, they ate in his solar, just him and her and Sansa. That </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was when Arya missed her brothers most. She wanted to tease Bran and play with </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">baby Rickon and have Robb smile at her. She wanted Jon to muss up her hair and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">call her “little sister” and finish her sentences with her. But all of them were gone. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">She had no one left but Sansa, and Sansa wouldn’t even talk to her unless Father </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">made her. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Back at Winterfell, they had eaten in the Great Hall almost half the time. Her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father used to say that a lord needed to eat with his men, if he hoped to keep them. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“Know the men who follow you,” she heard him tell Robb once, “and let them </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">know you. Don’t ask your men to die for a stranger.” At Winterfell, he always had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">an extra seat set at his own table, and every day a different man would be asked to </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">join him. One night it would be Vayon Poole, and the talk would be coppers and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bread stores and servants. The next time it would be Mikken, and her father would </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">listen to him go on about armor and swords and how hot a forge should be and the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">best way to temper steel. Another day it might be Hullen with his endless horse talk, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">or Septon Chayle from the library, or Jory, or Ser Rodrik, or even Old Nan with her </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya had loved nothing better than to sit at her father’s table and listen to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">them talk. She had loved listening to the men on the benches too; to freeriders tough </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as leather, courtly knights and bold young squires, grizzled old men-at-arms. She </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">used to throw snowballs at them and help them steal pies from the kitchen. Their </text>

<text top="197" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">monsters-and-maidens and hide-the-treasure and come-into-my-castle with their </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">children. Fat Tom used to call her “Arya Underfoot,” because he said that was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="723" height="22" font="2">where she always was. She’d liked that a lot better than “Arya Horseface.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Only that was Winterfell, a world away, and now everything was changed. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">This was the first time they had supped with the men since arriving in King’s </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Landing. Arya hated it. She  hated the sounds of their voices now, the way they </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">laughed, the stories they told. They’d been her friends, she’d felt safe around them, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but now she knew that was a lie. They’d let the queen kill Lady, that was horrible </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">enough, but then the Hound found Mycah. Jeyne Poole had told Arya that he’d cut </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him up in so many pieces that they’d given him back to the butcher in a bag, and at </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">first the poor man had thought it was a pig they’d slaughtered. And no one had </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raised a voice or drawn a blade or <i>anything</i>, not Harwin who always talked so bold, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">or Alyn who was going to be a knight, or Jory who was captain of the guard. Not </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">even her father. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He was my <i>friend</i>,” Arya whispered into her plate, so low that no one could </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hear. Her ribs sat there untouched, grown cold now, a thin film of grease congealing </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beneath them on the plate. Arya looked at them and felt ill. She pushed away from </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="94" height="22" font="2">the table. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">“Pray, where do you think you are going, young lady?” Septa Mordane asked. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I’m not hungry.” Arya found it an effort to remember her courtesies. “May I </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="384" height="22" font="2">be excused, please?” she recited stiffly. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You may not,” the septa said. “You have scarcely touched your food. You </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">will sit down and clean your plate.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You clean it!” Before anyone could stop her, Arya bolted for the door as the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">men laughed and Septa Mordane called loudly after her, her voice rising higher and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">higher. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Fat Tom was at his post, guarding the door to the Tower of the Hand. He </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blinked when he saw Arya rushing toward him and heard the septa’s shouts. “Here </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">now, little one, hold on,” he started to say, reaching, but Arya slid between his legs </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and then she was running up the winding tower steps, her feet hammering on the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">stone while Fat Tom huffed and puffed behind her. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her bedchamber was the only place that Arya liked in all of King’s Landing, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the thing she liked best about it was the door, a massive slab of dark oak with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">black iron bands. When she slammed that door and dropped the heavy crossbar, </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nobody could get into her room, not Septa Mordane or Fat Tom or Sansa or Jory or </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">the Hound, <i>nobody!</i> She slammed it now. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="593" height="22" font="2">When the bar was down, Arya finally felt safe enough to cry. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She went to the window seat and sat there, sniffling, hating them all, and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">herself most of all. It was all her fault, everything bad that had happened. Sansa said </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="177" height="22" font="2">so, and Jeyne too. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Fat Tom was knocking on her door. “Arya girl, what’s wrong?” he called out. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="158" height="22" font="2">“You in there?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” she shouted. The knocking stopped. A moment later she heard him </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">going away. Fat Tom was always easy to fool. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya went to the chest at the foot of her bed. She knelt, opened the lid, and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">began pulling her clothes out with both hands, grabbing handfuls of silk and satin </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and velvet and wool and tossing them on the floor. It was there at the bottom of the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chest, where she’d hidden it. Arya lifted it out almost tenderly and drew the slender </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">blade from its sheath. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="80" height="22" font="2">Needle. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She thought of Mycah again and her eyes filled with tears. Her fault, her fault, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">her fault. If she had never asked him to play at swords with her. . .  </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was a pounding at her door, louder than before. “<i>Arya Stark, you open </i></text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="4"><i>this door at once, do you hear me?</i>” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Arya spun around, with Needle in her hand. “You better not come in here!” </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">she warned. She slashed at the air savagely. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="505" height="22" font="2">“<i>The Hand will hear of this!</i>” Septa Mordane raged. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="420" height="22" font="2">“I don’t care,” Arya screamed. “Go away.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>You will rue this insolent behavior, young lady, I promise you that</i>.” Arya </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">listened at the door until she heard the sound of the septa’s receding footsteps. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She went back to the window, Needle in hand, and looked down into the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">courtyard below. If only she could climb like Bran, she thought; she would go out </text>

<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa and Septa Mordane and Prince Joffrey, from all of them. Steal some food </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from the kitchens, take Needle and her good boots and a warm cloak. She could </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">find Nymeria in the wild woods below the Trident, and together they’d return to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, or run to Jon on the Wall. She found herself wishing that Jon was here </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="528" height="22" font="2">with her now. Then maybe she wouldn’t feel so alone. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A soft knock at the door behind her turned Arya away from the window and </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her dreams of escape. “Arya,” her father’s voice called out. “Open the door. We </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">need to talk.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya crossed the room and lifted the crossbar. Father was alone. He seemed </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">more sad than angry. That made Arya feel even worse. “May I come in?” Arya </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">nodded, then dropped her eyes, ashamed. Father closed the door. “Whose sword is </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">that?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="542" height="22" font="2">“Mine.” Arya had almost forgotten Needle, in her hand. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="159" height="22" font="2">“Give it to me.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Reluctantly Arya surrendered her sword, wondering if she would ever hold it </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">again. Her father turned it in the light, examining both sides of the blade. He tested </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the point with his thumb. “A bravo’s blade,” he said. “Yet it seems to me that I </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">know this maker’s mark. This is Mikken’s work.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">Arya could not lie to him. She lowered her eyes. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lord Eddard Stark sighed. “My nine-year-old daughter is being armed from </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my own forge, and I know nothing of it. The Hand of the King is expected to rule </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Seven Kingdoms, yet it seems I cannot even rule my own household. How is it </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="612" height="22" font="2">that you come to own a sword, Arya? Where did you get this?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya chewed her lip and said nothing. She would not betray Jon, not even to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="118" height="22" font="2">their father. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">After a while, Father said, “I don’t suppose it matters, truly.” He looked down </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gravely at the sword in his hands. “This is no toy for children, least of all for a girl. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="747" height="22" font="2">What would Septa Mordane say if she knew you were playing with swords?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="568" height="22" font="2">“I wasn’t <i>playing</i>,” Arya insisted. “I hate Septa Mordane.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That’s enough.” Her father’s voice was curt and hard. “The septa is doing no </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">more than is her duty, though gods know you have made it a struggle for the poor </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">woman. Your mother and I have charged her with the impossible task of making </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="123" height="22" font="2">you a lady.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="392" height="22" font="2">“I don’t <i>want</i> to be a lady!” Arya flared. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I ought to snap this toy across my knee here and now, and put an end to this </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">nonsense.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Needle wouldn’t break,” Arya said defiantly, but her voice betrayed her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">words. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It has a name, does it?” Her father sighed. “Ah, Arya. You have a wildness in </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">you, child. ‘The wolf blood,’ my father used to call it. Lyanna had a touch of it, and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">my brother Brandon more than a touch. It brought them both to an early grave.” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Arya heard sadness in his voice; he did not often speak of his father, or of the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother and sister who had died before she was born. “Lyanna might have carried a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sword, if my lord father had allowed it. You remind me of her sometimes. You even </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="2">look like her.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Lyanna was beautiful,” Arya said, startled. Everybody said so. It was not a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">thing that was ever said of Arya. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“She was,” Eddard Stark agreed, “beautiful, and willful, and dead before her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">time.” He lifted the sword, held it out between them. “Arya, what did you think to </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">do with this. . . Needle? Who did you hope to skewer? Your sister? Septa Mordane? </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">All she could think of was the lesson Jon had given her. “Stick them with the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">pointy end,” she blurted out. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="685" height="22" font="2">Her father snorted back laughter. “That <i>is</i> the essence of it, I suppose.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya desperately wanted to explain, to make him see. “I was trying to learn, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but. . .” Her eyes filled with tears. “I asked Mycah to practice with me.” The grief </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">came on her all at once. She turned away, shaking. “I <i>asked</i> him,” she cried. “It was </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">my fault, it was me. . .” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Suddenly her father’s arms were around her. He held her gently as she turned </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to him and sobbed against his chest. “No, sweet one,” he murmured. “Grieve for </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">your friend, but never blame yourself. You did not kill  the butcher’s boy. That </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="679" height="22" font="2">murder lies at the Hound’s door, him and the cruel woman he serves.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I hate them,” Arya confided, red-faced, sniffling. “The Hound and the queen </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and the king and Prince Joffrey. I hate all of them. Joffrey <i>lied</i>, it wasn’t the way he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">said. I hate Sansa too. She <i>did</i> remember, she just lied so Joffrey would like her.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We all lie,” her father said. “Or did you truly think I’d believe that Nymeria </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">ran off?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="484" height="22" font="2">Arya blushed guiltily. “Jory promised not to tell.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Jory kept his word,” her father said with a smile. “There are some things I do </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">not need to be told. Even a blind man could see that wolf would never have left you </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="109" height="22" font="2">willingly.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We had to throw rocks,” she said miserably. “I <i>told</i> her to run, to go be free, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that I didn’t want her anymore. There were other wolves for her to play with, we </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">heard them howling, and Jory said the woods were full of game, so she’d have deer </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to hunt. Only she kept following, and finally we had to throw rocks. I hit her twice. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She whined and looked at me and I felt so ’shamed, but it was right, wasn’t it? The </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">queen would have killed her.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It was right,” her father said. “And even the lie was. . . not without honor.” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He’d put Needle aside when he went to Arya to embrace her. Now he took the blade </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">up again and walked to the window, where he stood for a moment, looking out </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">across the courtyard. When he turned back, his eyes were thoughtful. He seated </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">himself on the window seat, Needle across his lap. “Arya, sit down. I need to try </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">and explain some things to you.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She perched anxiously on the edge of her bed. “You are too young to be </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">burdened with all my cares,” he told her, “but you are also a Stark of Winterfell. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">You know our words.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="362" height="22" font="2">“<i>Winter is coming</i>,” Arya whispered. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The hard cruel times,” her father said. “We tasted them on the Trident, child, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and when Bran fell. You were born in the long summer, sweet one, you’ve never </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">known anything else, but now the winter is truly coming. Remember the sigil of our </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="2">House, Arya.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The direwolf,” she said, thinking of Nymeria. She hugged her knees against </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">her chest, suddenly afraid. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Let me tell you something about wolves, child. When the snows fall and the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">strengths. So if you must hate, Arya, hate those who would truly do us harm. Septa </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Mordane is a good woman, and Sansa. . . Sansa is your sister. You may be as </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">different as the sun and the moon, but the same blood flows through both your </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">hearts. You need her, as she needs you. . . and I need both of you, gods help me.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He sounded so tired that it made Arya sad. “I don’t hate Sansa,” she told him. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">“Not truly.” It was only half a lie. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I do not mean to frighten you, but neither will I lie to you. We have come to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a dark dangerous place, child. This is not Winterfell. We have enemies who mean </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">us ill. We cannot fight a war among ourselves. This willfulness of yours, the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">running off, the angry words, the disobedience. . . at home, these were only the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">summer games of a child. Here and now, with winter soon upon us, that is a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="470" height="22" font="2">different matter. It is time to begin growing up.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I will,” Arya vowed. She had never loved him so much as she did in that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">instant. “I can be strong too. I can be as strong as Robb.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="428" height="22" font="2">He held Needle out to her, hilt first. “Here.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She looked at the sword with wonder in her eyes. For a moment she was </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">afraid to touch it, afraid that if she reached for it, it would be snatched away again, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">but then her father said, “Go on, it’s yours,” and she took it in her hand. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="359" height="22" font="2">“I can keep it?” she said. “For true?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“For true.” He smiled. “If I took it away, no doubt I’d find a morningstar </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hidden under your pillow within the fortnight. Try not to stab your sister, whatever </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">the provocation.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I won’t. I promise.” Arya clutched Needle tightly to her chest as her father </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">took his leave. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The next morning, as they broke their fast, she apologized to Septa Mordane </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">and asked for her pardon. The septa peered at her suspiciously, but Father nodded. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Three days later, at midday, her father’s steward Vayon Poole sent Arya to the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Small Hall. The trestle tables had been dismantled and the benches shoved against </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the walls. The hall seemed empty, until an unfamiliar voice said, “You are late, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">boy.” A slight man with a bald head and a great beak of a nose stepped out of the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadows, holding a pair of slender wooden swords. “Tomorrow you will be here at </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="768" height="22" font="2">midday.” He had an accent, the lilt of the Free Cities, Braavos perhaps, or Myr. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="283" height="22" font="2">“Who are you?” Arya asked. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I am your dancing master.” He tossed her one of the wooden blades. She </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">grabbed for it, missed, and heard it clatter to the floor. “Tomorrow you will catch it. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="166" height="22" font="2">Now pick it up.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was not just a stick, but a true wooden sword complete with grip and guard </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and pommel. Arya picked it up and clutched it nervously with both hands, holding </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="750" height="22" font="2">it out in front of her. It was heavier than it looked, much heavier than Needle. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The bald man clicked his teeth together. “That is not the way, boy. This is not </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a greatsword that is needing two hands to swing it. You will take the blade in one </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">hand.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="270" height="22" font="2">“It’s too heavy,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong, and for the balancing. A </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="750" height="22" font="2">hollow inside is filled with lead, just so. One hand now is all that is needing.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya took her right hand off the grip and wiped her sweaty palm on her pants. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She held the sword in her left hand. He seemed to approve. “The left is good. All is </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">reversed, it will make your enemies more awkward. Now you are standing wrong. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Turn your body sideface, yes, so. You are skinny as the shaft of a spear, do you </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">know. That is good too, the target is smaller. Now the grip. Let me see.” He moved </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">closer and peered at her hand, prying her fingers apart, rearranging them. “Just so, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">yes. Do not squeeze it so tight, no, the grip must be deft, delicate.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="299" height="22" font="2">“What if I drop it?” Arya said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The steel must be part of your arm,” the bald man told her. “Can you drop </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="709" height="22" font="2">It was the third time he had called her “boy.” “I’m a girl,” Arya objected. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Boy, girl,” Syrio Forel said. “You are a sword, that is all.” He clicked his </text>

<text top="318" left="172" width="703" height="22" font="2">immense and empty, a vast flat expanse that reached to the distant </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">horizon and beyond. It <i>was</i> a sea, Dany thought. Past here, there were no hills, no </text>

<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Here and now,” Ser Jorah agreed. “You ought to see it when it blooms, all </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dark red flowers from horizon to horizon, like a sea of blood. Come the dry season, </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the world turns the color of old bronze. And this is only <i>hranna</i>, child. There </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">are a hundred kinds of grass out there, grasses as yellow as lemon and as dark as </text>

<text top="676" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">That thought gave Dany the shivers. “I don’t want to talk about that now,” she </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">said. “It’s so beautiful here, I don’t want to think about everything dying.” </text>

<text top="842" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fluid as centaurs, but Viserys still struggled with the short stirrups and the flat </text>

<text top="897" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Illyrio had urged him to wait in Pentos, had offered him the hospitality of his </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">manse, but Viserys would have none of it. He would stay with Drogo until the debt </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had been paid, until he had the crown he had been promised. “And if he tries to </text>

<text top="1063" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany realized that she did not want to listen to any of her brother’s complaints </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">right now. The day was too perfect. The sky was a deep blue, and high above them </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the air was warm on her face, and Dany felt at peace. She would not let Viserys </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="78" height="22" font="2">spoil it. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Wait here,” Dany told Ser Jorah. “Tell them all to stay. Tell them I command </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The knight smiled. Ser Jorah was not a handsome man. He had a neck and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shoulders like a bull, and coarse black hair covered his arms and chest so thickly </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that there was none left for his head. Yet his smiles gave Dany comfort. “You are </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">learning to talk like a queen, Daenerys.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Not a queen,” said Dany. “A  <i>khaleesi</i>.” She wheeled her horse about and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">galloped down the ridge alone. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The descent was steep and rocky, but Dany rode fearlessly, and the joy and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the danger of it were a song in her heart. All her life Viserys had told her she was a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="812" height="22" font="2">princess, but not until she rode her silver had Daenerys Targaryen ever felt like one. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">At first it had not come easy. The <i>khalasar</i> had broken camp the morning after </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her wedding, moving east toward Vaes Dothrak, and by the third day Dany thought </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she was going to die. Saddle sores opened on her bottom, hideous and bloody. Her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thighs were chafed raw, her hands blistered from the reins, the muscles of her legs </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and back so wracked with pain that she could scarcely sit. By the time dusk fell, her </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="558" height="22" font="2">handmaids would need to help her down from her mount. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Even the nights brought no relief. Khal Drogo ignored her when they rode, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">even as he had ignored her during their wedding, and spent his evenings drinking </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with his warriors and bloodriders, racing his prize horses, watching women dance </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and men die. Dany had no place in these parts of his life. She was left to sup alone, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">or with Ser Jorah and her brother, and afterward to cry herself to sleep. Yet every </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">night, some time before the dawn, Drogo would come to her tent and wake her in </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the dark, to ride her as relentlessly as he rode his stallion. He always took her from </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">behind, Dothraki fashion, for which Dany was grateful; that way her lord husband </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could not see the tears that wet her face, and she could use her pillow to muffle her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cries of pain. When he was done, he would close his eyes and begin to snore softly </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and Dany would lie beside him, her body bruised and sore, hurting too much for </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">sleep. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Day followed day, and night followed night, until Dany knew she could not </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">endure a moment longer. She would kill herself rather than go on, she decided one </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">night. . .  </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Yet when she slept that night, she dreamt the dragon dream again. Viserys </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was not in it this time. There was only her and the dragon. Its scales were black as </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">night, wet and slick with blood.  <i>Her</i>  blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were pools of </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, the flame came roaring out in a hot </text>

<page number="183" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">jet. She could hear it singing to her, She opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">it swallow her whole, let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean. She </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood boil and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">turn to steam, and yet there was no pain. She felt strong and new and fierce. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And the next day, strangely, she did not seem to hurt quite so much. It was as </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">if the gods had heard her and taken pity. Even her handmaids noticed the change. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="546" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>,” Jhiqui said, “what is wrong? Are you sick?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I was,” she answered, standing over the dragon’s eggs that Illyrio had given </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">her when she wed. She touched one, the largest of the three, running her hand </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lightly over the shelf. <i>Black-and-scarlet</i>, she thought, <i>like the dragon in my dream</i>. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The stone felt strangely warm beneath her fingers. . . or was she still dreaming? She </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="313" height="22" font="2">pulled her hand back nervously. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">From that hour onward, each day was easier than the one before it. Her legs </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">grew stronger; her blisters burst and her hands grew callused; her soft thighs </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">toughened, supple as leather. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The  <i>khal</i>  had commanded the handmaid Irri to teach Dany to ride in the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dothraki fashion, but it was the filly who was her real teacher. The horse seemed to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">know her moods, as if they shared a single mind. With every passing day, Dany felt </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">surer in her seat. The Dothraki were a hard and unsentimental people, and it was not </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">their custom to name their animals, so Dany thought of her only as the silver. She </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="342" height="22" font="2">had never loved anything so much. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As the riding became less an ordeal, Dany began to notice the beauties of the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">land around her. She rode at the head of the  <i>khalasar</i>  with Drogo and his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bloodriders, so she came to each country fresh and unspoiled. Behind them the great </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">horde might tear the earth and muddy the rivers and send up clouds of choking dust, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">but the fields ahead of them were always green and verdant. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">They crossed the rolling hills of Norvos, past terraced farms and small </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">villages where the townsfolk watched anxiously from atop white stucco walls. They </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">forded three wide placid rivers and a fourth that was swift and narrow and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">treacherous, camped beside a high blue waterfall, skirted the tumbled ruins of a vast </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dead city where ghosts were said to moan among blackened marble columns. They </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">raced down Valyrian roads a thousand years old and straight as a Dothraki arrow. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">For half a moon, they rode through the Forest of Qohor, where the leaves made a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">golden canopy high above them, and the trunks of the trees were as wide as city </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gates. There were great elk in that wood, and spotted tigers, and lemurs with silver </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fur and huge purple eyes, but all fled before the approach of the <i>khalasar</i> and Dany </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">got no glimpse of them. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">By then her agony was a fading memory. She still ached after a long day’s </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">riding, yet somehow the pain had a sweetness to it now, and each morning she came </text>

<page number="184" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">willingly to her saddle, eager to know what wonders waited for her in the lands </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ahead. She began to find pleasure even in her nights, and if she still cried out when </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="409" height="22" font="2">Drogo took her, it was not always in pain. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">At the bottom of the ridge, the grasses rose around her, tall and supple. Dany </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">slowed to a trot and rode out onto the plain, losing herself in the green, blessedly </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">alone. In the <i>khalasar</i> she was never alone. Khal Drogo came to her only after the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sun went down, but her handmaids fed her and bathed her and slept by the door of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">her tent, Drogo’s bloodriders and the men of her  <i>khas</i>  were never far, and her </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother was an unwelcome shadow, day and night. Dany could hear him on the top </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of the ridge, his voice shrill with anger as he shouted at Ser Jorah. She rode on, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">submerging herself deeper in the Dothraki sea. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The green swallowed her up. The air was rich with the scents of earth and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grass, mixed with the smell of horseflesh and Dany’s sweat and the oil in her hair. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dothraki smells. They seemed to belong here. Dany breathed it all in, laughing. She </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had a sudden urge to feel the ground beneath her, to curl her toes in that thick black </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soil. Swinging down from her saddle, she let the silver graze while she pulled off </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">her high boots. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Viserys came upon her as sudden as a summer storm, his horse rearing </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beneath him as he reined up too hard. “You <i>dare!</i>” he screamed at her. “You give </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commands to  <i>me? To me?</i>”  He vaulted off the horse, stumbling as he landed. His </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face was flushed as he struggled back to his feet. He grabbed her, shook her. “Have </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="537" height="22" font="2">you forgotten who you are? Look at you. <i>Look at you!</i>” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany did not need to look. She was barefoot, with oiled hair, wearing </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dothraki riding leathers and a painted vest given her as a bride gift. She looked as </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">though she belonged here. Viserys was soiled and stained in city silks and ringmail. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="773" height="22" font="2">He was still screaming. “You do  <i>not</i>  command the dragon. Do you </text>

<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">horselord’s slut, do you hear me?” His hand went under her vest, his fingers digging </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">painfully into her breast. “<i>Do you hear me?</i>” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="293" height="22" font="2">Dany shoved him away, hard. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Viserys stared at her, his lilac  eyes incredulous. She had never defied him. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Never fought back. Rage twisted his features. He would hurt her now, and badly, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="2">she knew that. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="71" height="22" font="4"><i>Crack</i>. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The whip made a sound like thunder. The coil took Viserys around the throat </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and yanked him backward. He went sprawling in the grass, stunned and choking. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The Dothraki riders hooted at him as he struggled to free himself. The one with the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whip, young Jhogo, rasped a question. Dany did not understand his words, but by </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">then Irri was there, and Ser Jorah, and the rest of her <i>khas</i>. “Jhogo asks if you would </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="346" height="22" font="2">have him dead, <i>Khaleesi</i>, “Irri said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="262" height="22" font="2">“No,” Dany replied. “No.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Jhogo understood that. One of the others barked out a comment, and the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dothraki laughed. Irri told her, “Quaro thinks you should take an ear to teach him </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">respect.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Her brother was on his knees, his fingers digging under the leather coils, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">crying incoherently, struggling for breath. The whip was tight around his windpipe. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="488" height="22" font="2">“Tell them I do not wish him harmed,” Dany said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Irri repeated her words in Dothraki. Jhogo gave a pull on the whip, yanking </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Viserys around like a puppet on a string. He went sprawling again, freed from the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">leather embrace, a thin line of blood under his chin where the whip had cut deep. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I warned him what would happen, my lady,” Ser Jorah Mormont said. “I told </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">him to stay on the ridge, as you commanded.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I know you did,” Dany replied, watching Viserys. He lay on the ground, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sucking in air noisily, red-faced and sobbing. He was a pitiful thing. He had always </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been a pitiful thing. Why had she never seen that before? There was a hollow place </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="342" height="22" font="2">inside her where her fear had been. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Take his horse,” Dany commanded Ser Jorah. Viserys gaped at her. He could </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">not believe what he was hearing; nor could Dany quite believe what she was saying. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Yet the words came. “Let my brother walk behind us back to the <i>khalasar</i>.” Among </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Dothraki, the man who does not ride was no man at all, the lowest of the low, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">without honor or pride. “Let everyone see him as he is.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” Viserys screamed. He turned to Ser Jorah, pleading in the Common </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tongue with words the horsemen would not understand. “Hit her, Mormont. Hurt </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="674" height="22" font="2">her. Your king commands it. Kill these Dothraki dogs and teach her.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The exile knight looked from Dany to her brother; she barefoot, with dirt </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">between her toes and oil in her hair, he with his silks and steel. Dany could see the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">decision on his face. “He shall walk, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” he said. He took her brother’s horse </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">in hand while Dany remounted her silver. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Viserys gaped at him, and sat down in the dirt. He kept his silence, but he </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would not move, and his eyes were full of poison as they rode away. Soon he was </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lost in the tall grass. When they could not see him anymore, Dany grew afraid. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="608" height="22" font="2">“Will he find his way back?” she asked Ser Jorah as they rode. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Even a man as  blind as your brother should be able to follow our trail,” he </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">replied. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="511" height="22" font="2">“He is proud. He may be too shamed to come back.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jorah laughed. “Where else should he go? If he cannot find the <i>khalasar</i>, the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="792" height="22" font="4"><i>khalasar</i> will most surely find him. It is hard to drown in the Dothraki sea, child.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany saw the truth of that. The <i>khalasar</i> was like a city on the march, but it </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">did not march blindly. Always scouts ranged far ahead of the main column, alert for </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">any sign of game or prey or enemies, while outriders guarded their  flanks. They </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">missed nothing, not here, in this land, the place where they had come from. These </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">plains were a part of them. . . and of her, now. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I hit him,” she said, wonder in her voice. Now that it was over, it seemed like </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">some strange dream that she had dreamed. “Ser Jorah, do you think. . . he’ll be so </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="704" height="22" font="2">angry when he gets back. . . She shivered. “I woke the dragon, didn’t I?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah snorted. “Can you wake the dead, girl? Your brother Rhaegar was </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the last dragon, and he died on the Trident. Viserys is less than the shadow of a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">snake.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His blunt words startled her. It seemed as though all the things she had always </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">believed were suddenly called into question. “You. . .   you swore him your </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">sword. . .” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That I did, girl,” Ser Jorah said. “And if your brother is the shadow of a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">snake, what does that make his servants?” His voice was bitter. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="339" height="22" font="2">“He is still the true king. He is. . .” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jorah pulled up his horse and looked at her. “Truth now. Would you want to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">see Viserys sit a throne?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="711" height="22" font="2">Dany thought about that. “He would not be a very good king, would he?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“There have been worse. . . but not many.” The knight gave his heels to his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="276" height="22" font="2">mount and started off again. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany rode close beside him. “Still,” she said, “the common people are waiting </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">for him. Magister Illyrio says they are sewing dragon banners and praying for </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">Viserys to return from across the narrow sea to free them.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ends,” Ser Jorah told her. “It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">of thrones, so long as they are left in peace.” He gave a shrug. “They never are.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany rode along quietly for a time, working his words like a puzzle box. It </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">went against everything that Viserys had ever told her to think that the people could </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">care so little whether a true king or a usurper reigned over them. Yet the more she </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="525" height="22" font="2">thought on Jorah’s words, the more they rang of truth. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="493" height="22" font="2">“What do <i>you</i> pray for, Ser Jorah?” she asked him. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“Home,” he said. His voice was thick with longing. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">“I pray for home too,” she told him, believing it. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="526" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah laughed. “Look around you then, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">But it was not the plains Dany saw then. It was King’s Landing and the great </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Red Keep that Aegon the Conqueror had built. It was Dragonstone where she had </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been born. In her mind’s eye they burned with a thousand lights, a fire blazing in </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">every window. In her mind’s eye, all the doors were red. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms,” Dany said. She had </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">known that for a long time, she realized. She had known it all her life. Only she had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">never let herself say the words, even in a whisper, but now she said them for Jorah </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">Mormont and all the world to hear. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="528" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah gave her a measuring look. “You think not.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“He could not lead an army even if my lord husband gave him one,” Dany </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said. “He has no coin and the only knight who follows him reviles him as less than </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">a snake. The Dothraki make mock of his weakness. He will never take us home.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="323" height="22" font="2">“Wise child.” The knight smiled. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I am no child,” she told him fiercely. Her heels pressed into the sides of her </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mount, rousing the silver to a gallop. Faster and faster she raced, leaving Jorah and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Irri and the others far behind, the warm wind in her hair and the setting sun red on </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="577" height="22" font="2">her face. By the time she reached the <i>khalasar</i>, it was dusk. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The slaves had erected her tent by the shore of a spring-fed pool. She could </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hear rough voices from the woven grass palace on the hill. Soon there would be </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">laughter, when the men of her  <i>khas</i>  told the story of what had happened in the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">grasses today. By the time Viserys came limping back among them, every man, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">woman, and child in the camp would know him for a walker. There were no secrets </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">in the <i>khalasar</i>. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her tent. It </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was cool and dim beneath the silk. As she let the door flap close behind her, Dany </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to touch her dragon’s eggs across the tent. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">For an instant a thousand droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes. She </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="283" height="22" font="2">blinked, and they were gone. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Stone</i>, she told herself. <i>They are only stone, even Illyrio said so, the dragons </i></text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>are all dead</i>.  She put her palm against the black egg, fingers spread gently across </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">the curve of the shell. The stone was warm. Almost hot. “The sun,” Dany </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">whispered. “The sun warmed them as they rode.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She commanded her handmaids to prepare her a bath. Doreah built a fire </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">outside the tent, while Irri and Jhiqui fetched the big copper tub—another bride </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">gift—from the packhorses and carried water from the pool. When the bath was </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="546" height="22" font="2">steaming, Irri helped her into it and climbed in after her. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Have you ever seen a dragon?” she asked as Irri scrubbed her back and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Jhiqui sluiced sand from her hair. She had heard that the first dragons had come </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from the east, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">Sea. Perhaps some were still living there, in realms strange and wild. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="386" height="22" font="2">“Dragons are gone, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Irri said. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">“Dead,” agreed Jhiqui. “Long and long ago.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a </text>

<page number="188" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">century and a half ago, during the reign of Aegon III, who was called the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Dragonbane. That did not seem so long ago to Dany. “Everywhere?” she said, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">disappointed. “Even in the east?” Magic had died in the west when the Doom fell </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on Valyria and the Lands of the Long Summer, and neither spell-forged steel nor </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stormsingers nor dragons could hold it back, but Dany had always heard that the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">east was different. It was said that manticores prowled the islands of the Jade Sea, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">that basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti, that spellsingers, warlocks, and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night. Why shouldn’t there be </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">dragons too? </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No dragon,” Irri said. “Brave men kill them, for dragon terrible evil beasts. It </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="110" height="22" font="2">is known.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="282" height="22" font="2">“It is known,” agreed Jhiqui. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A trader from Qarth once told me that dragons came from the moon,” blond </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Doreah said as she warmed a towel over the fire. Jhiqui and Irri were of an age with </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dany, Dothraki girls taken as slaves when Drogo destroyed their father’s <i>khalasar</i>. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Doreah was older, almost twenty. Magister Illyrio had found her in a pleasure house </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">in Lys. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Silvery-wet hair tumbled across her eyes as Dany turned her head, curious. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">“The moon?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He told me the moon was an egg,  <i>Khaleesi</i>,” the Lysene girl said. “Once </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there were two moons in the sky, but one wandered too close to the sun and cracked </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from the heat. A thousand thousand dragons poured forth, and drank the fire of the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sun. That is why dragons breathe flame. One day the other moon will kiss the sun </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="533" height="22" font="2">too, and then it will crack and the dragons will return.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The two Dothraki girls giggled and laughed. “You are foolish strawhead </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">slave,” Irri said. “Moon is no egg. Moon is god, woman wife of sun. It is known.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="282" height="22" font="2">“It is known,” Jhiqui agreed. </text>

<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her supper was a simple meal of fruit and cheese and fry bread, with a jug of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">honeyed wine to wash it down. “Doreah, stay and eat with me,” Dany commanded </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">when she sent her other handmaids away. The Lysene girl had hair the color of </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She lowered those eyes when they were alone. “You honor me, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” she </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">said, but it was no honor, only service. Long after the moon had risen, they sat </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That night, when Khal Drogo came, Dany was waiting for him. He stood in </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the door of her tent and looked at her with surprise. She rose slowly and opened her </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sleeping silks and let them fall to the ground. “This night we must go outside, my </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lord,” she told him, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo followed her out into the moonlight, the bells in his hair tinkling </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">softly. A few yards from her tent was a bed of soft grass, and it was there that Dany </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">drew him down. When he tried to turn her over, she put a hand on his chest. “No,” </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">she said. “This night I would look on your face.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There is no privacy in the heart of the <i>khalasar</i>. Dany felt the eyes on her as </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she undressed him, heard the soft voices as she did the things that Doreah had told </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her to do. It was nothing to her. Was she not <i>khaleesi</i>? His were the only eyes that </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mattered, and when she mounted him she saw something there that she had never </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seen before. She rode him as fiercely as ever she had ridden her silver, and when </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="649" height="22" font="2">the moment of his pleasure came, Khal Drogo called out her name. </text>

<text top="373" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">spinning and snapping if the other wolves came too close. His fur had darkened </text>

<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Smaller than Grey Wind, and more wary. Bran thought he was the smartest of the </text>

<text top="511" left="54" width="362" height="22" font="2">hard-packed earth on little baby legs. </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His eyes stung. He wanted to be down there, laughing and running. Angry at </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the thought, Bran knuckled away the tears before they could fall. His eighth name </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="711" height="22" font="2">day had come and gone. He was almost a man grown now, too old to cry. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It was just a lie,” he said bitterly, remembering the crow from his dream. “I </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">can’t fly. I can’t even run.” </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Crows are all liars,” Old Nan agreed, from the chair where she sat doing her </text>

<text top="731" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I don’t want any more stories,” Bran snapped, his voice petulant. He had </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">liked Old Nan and her stories once. Before. But it was different now. They left her </text>

<text top="814" left="54" width="604" height="22" font="2">lonely, but she just made it worse. “I hate your stupid stories.” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The old woman smiled at him toothlessly. “My stories? No, my little lord, not </text>

<text top="897" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">She was a very ugly old woman, Bran thought spitefully; shrunken and </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wrinkled, almost blind, too weak to climb stairs, with only a few wisps of white hair </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">left to cover a mottled pink scalp. No one really knew how old she was, but his </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">father said she’d been called Old Nan even when he was a boy. She was the oldest </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I don’t care whose stories they are,” Bran told her, “I hate them.” He didn’t </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">want stories and he didn’t want Old Nan. He wanted his mother and father. He </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wanted to go running with Summer loping beside him. He wanted to climb the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">broken tower and feed corn to the crows. He wanted to ride his pony again with his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="538" height="22" font="2">brothers. He wanted it to be the way it had been before. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I know a story about a boy who hated stories,” Old Nan said with her stupid </text>

<text top="473" left="54" width="165" height="22" font="2">to scream at her. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">It  would never be the way it had been, he knew. The crow had tricked him </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">into flying, but when he woke up he was broken and the world was changed. They </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">had all left him, his father and his mother and his sisters and even his bastard </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother Jon. His father had promised he would ride a real horse to King’s Landing, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but they’d gone without him. Maester Luwin had sent a bird after Lord Eddard with </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a message, and another to Mother and a third to Jon on the Wall, but there had been </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">no answers. “Ofttimes the birds are lost, child,” the maester had told him. “There’s </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">many a mile and many a hawk between here and King’s Landing, the message may </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">not have reached them.” Yet to Bran it felt as if they had all died while he had </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">slept . . . or perhaps Bran had died, and they had forgotten him. Jory and Ser Rodrik </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Vayon Poole had gone too, and Hullen and Harwin and Fat Tom and a quarter </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="128" height="22" font="2">of the guard. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Only Robb and baby Rickon were still here, and Robb was changed. He was </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Robb the Lord now, or trying to be. He wore a real sword and never smiled. His </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">days were spent drilling the guard and practicing his swordplay, making the yard </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ring with the sound of steel as Bran watched forlornly from his window. At night he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">closeted himself with Maester Luwin, talking or going over account  books. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sometimes he would ride out with Hallis Mollen and be gone for days at a time, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">visiting distant holdfasts. Whenever he was away more than a day, Rickon would </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">cry and ask Bran if Robb was ever coming back. Even when he was home at </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Thousands and thousands of years ago, Brandon the  Builder had raised </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, and some said the Wall. Bran knew the story, but it had never been his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">favorite. Maybe one of the other Brandons had liked that story. Sometimes  Nan </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">would talk to him as if he were  <i>her</i>  Brandon, the baby she had nursed all those </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">years ago, and sometimes she confused him with his uncle Brandon, who was killed </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">by the Mad King before Bran was even born. She had lived so long, Mother had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">told him once, that all the Brandon Starks had become one person in her head. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That’s not my favorite,” he said. “My favorites were the scary ones.” He </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">heard some sort of commotion outside and turned back to the window. Rickon was </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">running across the yard toward the gatehouse, the wolves following him, but the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tower faced the wrong way for Bran to see what was happening. He smashed a fist </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="414" height="22" font="2">on his thigh in frustration and felt nothing. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, my sweet summer child,” Old Nan said quietly, “what do <i>you</i> know of </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fear? Fear is for the winter, my little lord, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the ice wind comes howling out of the north. Fear is for the long night, when </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the sun hides its face for years at a time, and little children are born and live and die </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all in darkness while the direwolves grow gaunt and hungry, and the white walkers </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">move through the woods.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">“You mean the Others,” Bran said querulously. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“The Others,” Old Nan agreed. “Thousands and thousands of years ago, a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">winter fell that was cold and hard and endless beyond all memory of man. There </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">came a night that lasted a generation, and kings  shivered and died in their castles </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">even as the swineherds in their hovels. Women smothered their children rather than </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">see them starve, and cried, and felt their tears freeze on their cheeks.” Her voice and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her needles fell silent, and she glanced up at Bran with pale, filmy eyes and asked, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="441" height="22" font="2">“So, child. This is the sort of story you like?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="436" height="22" font="2">“Well,” Bran said reluctantly, “yes, only. . .” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Old Nan  nodded. “In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,” she </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said as her needles went <i>click click click</i>. “They were cold things, dead things, that </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">veins. They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">by the score, riding their pale dead horses and leading hosts of the slain. All the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swords of men could not stay their advance, and even maidens and suckling babes </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">found no pity in them. They hunted the maids through frozen forests, and fed their </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="452" height="22" font="2">dead servants on the flesh of human children.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her voice had dropped very low, almost to a whisper, and Bran found himself </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="247" height="22" font="2">leaning forward to listen. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Now these were the days before the Andals came, and long before the </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The door opened with a  <i>bang</i>,  and Bran’s heart leapt up into his mouth in </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sudden fear, but it was only Maester Luwin, with Hodor looming in the stairway </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">behind him. “Hodor!” the stableboy announced, as was his custom, smiling hugely </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">at them all. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin was not smiling. “We have visitors,” he announced, “and your </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">presence is required, Bran.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="476" height="22" font="2">“I’m listening to a story now,” Bran complained. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stories wait, my little lord, and when you come back to them, why, there </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they are,” Old Nan said. “Visitors are not so patient, and ofttimes they bring stories </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="140" height="22" font="2">of their own.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="397" height="22" font="2">“Who is it?” Bran asked Maester Luwin. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Tyrion Lannister, and some men of the Night’s Watch, with word from your </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brother Jon. Robb is meeting with them now. Hodor, will you help Bran down to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">the hall?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Hodor!” Hodor agreed happily. He ducked to get his great shaggy head under </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the door. Hodor was nearly seven feet tall. It was hard to believe that he was the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">same blood as Old Nan. Bran wondered if he would shrivel up as small as his great-</text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grandmother when he was old. It did not seem likely, even if Hodor lived to be a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">thousand. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Hodor lifted Bran as easy as if he were a bale of hay, and cradled him against </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his massive chest. He always smelled faintly of horses, but it was not a bad smell. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">His arms were thick with muscle and matted with brown hair. “Hodor,” he said </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">again. Theon Greyjoy had once commented that Hodor did not know much, but no </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">one could doubt that he knew his name. Old Nan had cackled like a hen when Bran </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">told her that, and confessed that Hodor’s real name was Walder. No one knew </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">where “Hodor” had come from, she said, but when he started saying it, they started </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="449" height="22" font="2">calling him by it. It was the only word he had. </text>
</page>
<page number="194" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">They left Old Nan in the tower room with her needles and her memories. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Hodor hummed tunelessly as he carried Bran down the steps and through the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">gallery, with Maester Luwin following behind, hurrying to keep up with the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">stableboy’s long strides. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robb was seated in Father’s high seat, wearing ringmail and boiled leather </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and the stern face of Robb the Lord. Theon Greyjoy and Hallis Mollen stood behind </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">him. A dozen guardsmen lined the grey stone walls beneath tall narrow windows. In </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the center of the room the dwarf stood with his servants, and four strangers in the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">black of the Night’s Watch. Bran could sense the anger in the hall the moment that </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">Hodor carried him through the doors. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Any man of the Night’s Watch is welcome here at Winterfell for as long as </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he wishes to stay,” Robb was saying with the voice of Robb the Lord. His sword </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was across his knees, the steel bare for all the world to see. Even Bran knew what it </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="478" height="22" font="2">meant to greet a guest with an unsheathed sword. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Any man of the Night’s Watch,” the dwarf repeated, “but not me, do I take </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">your meaning, boy?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb stood and pointed at the little man with his sword. “I am the lord here </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="668" height="22" font="2">while my mother and father are away, Lannister. I am not your boy.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If  you are a lord, you might learn a lord’s courtesy,” the little man replied, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ignoring the sword point in his face. “Your bastard brother has all your father’s </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="230" height="22" font="2">graces, it would seem.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="426" height="22" font="2">“<i>Jon</i>,” Bran gasped out from Hodor’s arms. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The dwarf turned to look at him.  “So it is true, the boy lives. I could scarce </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">believe it. You Starks are hard to kill.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You Lannisters had best remember that,” Robb said, lowering his sword. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="316" height="22" font="2">“Hodor, bring my brother here.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Hodor,” Hodor said, and he trotted forward smiling and set Bran in the high </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">seat of the Starks, where the Lords of Winterfell had sat since the days when they </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">called themselves the Kings in the North. The seat was cold stone, polished smooth </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">by countless bottoms; the carved heads of direwolves snarled on the ends of its </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">massive arms. Bran clasped them as he sat, his useless legs dangling. The great seat </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="262" height="22" font="2">made him feel half a baby. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb put a hand on his shoulder. “You said you had business with Bran. Well, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">here he is, Lannister.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran was uncomfortably aware of Tyrion Lannister’s eyes. One was black and </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one was green, and both were looking at him, studying him, weighing him. “I am </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">told you were quite the climber, Bran,” the little man said at last. “Tell me, how is it </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="307" height="22" font="2">you happened to fall that day?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="560" height="22" font="2">“I <i>never</i>,” Bran insisted. He never fell, never never <i>never</i>. </text>
</page>
<page number="195" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The child does not remember anything of the fall, or the climb that came </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">before it,” said Maester Luwin gently. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="328" height="22" font="2">“Curious,” said Tyrion Lannister. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My brother is not here to answer questions, Lannister,” Robb said  curtly. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">“Do your business and be on your way.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="717" height="22" font="2">“I have a gift for you,” the dwarf said to Bran. “Do you like to ride, boy?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin came forward. “My lord, the child has lost the use of his legs. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="224" height="22" font="2">He cannot sit a horse.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Nonsense,” said Lannister. “With the right horse and the right saddle, even a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="172" height="22" font="2">cripple can ride.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The word was a knife through Bran’s heart. He felt tears come unbidden to his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">eyes. “I’m <i>not</i> a cripple!” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Then I am not a dwarf,” the dwarf said with a twist of his mouth. “My father </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">will rejoice to hear it.” Greyjoy laughed. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="728" height="22" font="2">“What sort of horse and saddle are you suggesting?” Maester Luwin asked. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A smart horse,” Lannister replied. “The boy cannot use his legs to command </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the animal, so you must shape the horse to the rider, teach it to respond to the reins, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to the voice. I would begin with an unbroken yearling, with no old training to be </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">unlearned.” He drew a rolled paper from his belt. “Give this to your saddler. He will </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="172" height="22" font="2">provide the rest.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin took the paper from the dwarfs hand, curious as a small grey </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">squirrel. He unrolled it, studied it. “I see. You draw nicely, my lord. Yes, this ought </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">to work. I should have thought of this myself.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="705" height="22" font="2">“It came easier to me, Maester. It is not terribly unlike my own saddles.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Will I truly be able to ride?” Bran asked. He wanted to believe them, but he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was afraid. Perhaps it was just another lie. The crow had promised him that he </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">could fly. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You will,” the dwarf told him. “And I swear to you, boy, on horseback you </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="298" height="22" font="2">will be as tall as any of them.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robb Stark seemed puzzled. “Is this some trap, Lannister? What’s Bran to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">you? Why should you want to help him?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Your brother Jon asked it of me. And I have a tender spot in my heart for </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cripples and bastards and broken things.” Tyrion Lannister placed a hand over his </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="180" height="22" font="2">heart and grinned. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The door to the yard flew open. Sunlight came streaming across the hall as </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Rickon burst in, breathless. The direwolves were with him. The boy stopped by the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">door, wide-eyed, but the wolves came on. Their eyes found Lannister, or perhaps </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they caught his scent. Summer began to growl first. Grey Wind picked it up. They </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="680" height="22" font="2">padded toward the little man, one from the right and one from the left. </text>
</page>
<page number="196" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="740" height="22" font="2">“The wolves do not like your smell, Lannister,” Theon Greyjoy commented. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="774" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps it’s time I took my leave,” Tyrion said. He took a step </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">backward. . . and Shaggydog came out of the shadows behind him, snarling. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lannister recoiled, and Summer lunged at him from the other side. He reeled away, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">unsteady on his feet, and Grey Wind snapped at his arm, teeth ripping at his sleeve </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">and tearing loose a scrap of cloth. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister’s men reached for their </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">steel. “Summer, <i>here</i>. Summer, to me!” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The direwolf heard the voice, glanced at Bran, and again at Lannister. He </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crept backward, away from the little man, and settled down below Bran’s dangling </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="48" height="22" font="2">feet. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and called, “Grey </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Wind.” His direwolf moved to him, swift and silent. Now there was only </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, his eyes burning like green fire. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Rickon, call him,” Bran shouted to his baby brother, and Rickon remembered </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">himself and screamed, “Home, Shaggy, home now.” The black wolf gave Lannister </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="814" height="22" font="2">one final snarl and bounded off to Rickon, who hugged him tightly around the neck. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister undid his scarf, mopped at his brow, and said in a flat voice, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">“How interesting.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Are you well, my lord?” asked one of his men, his sword in hand. He glanced </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">nervously at the direwolves as he spoke. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My sleeve is torn and my breeches are unaccountably damp, but nothing was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="254" height="22" font="2">harmed save my dignity.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Even Robb looked shaken. “The wolves. . . I don’t know why they did </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">that. . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No doubt they mistook me for dinner.” Lannister bowed stiffly to Bran. “I </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thank you for calling them off, young ser. I promise you, they would have found me </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="508" height="22" font="2">quite indigestible. And now I <i>will</i> be leaving, truly.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“A moment, my lord,” Maester Luwin said. He moved to Robb and they </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">huddled close together, whispering. Bran tried to hear what they were saying, but </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">their voices were too low. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb Stark finally sheathed his sword. “I. . . I may have been hasty with you,” </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he said. “You’ve done Bran a kindness, and, well. . .” Robb composed himself with </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">an effort. “The hospitality of Winterfell is yours if you wish it, Lannister.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Spare me your false courtesies, boy. You do not love me and you do not </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">want me here. I saw an inn outside your walls, in the winter town. I’ll find a bed </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there, and both of us will sleep easier. For a few coppers I may even find a comely </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wench to warm the sheets for me.” He spoke to one of the black brothers, an old </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">man with a twisted back and a tangled beard. “Yoren, we go south at daybreak. You </text>
</page>
<page number="197" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">will find me on the road, no doubt.” With that he made his exit, struggling across </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">the hall on his short legs, past Rickon and out the door. His men followed. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The four of the Night’s Watch remained. Robb turned to them uncertainly. “I </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have had rooms prepared, and you’ll find no lack of hot water to wash off the dust </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of the road. I hope you will honor us at table tonight.” He spoke the words so </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">awkwardly that even Bran took note; it was a speech he had learned, not words </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">from the heart, but the black brothers thanked him all the same. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Summer followed them up the tower steps as Hodor carried Bran back to his </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">bed.  Old Nan was asleep in her chair. Hodor said “Hodor,” gathered up his great-</text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grandmother, and carried her off, snoring softly, while Bran lay thinking. Robb had </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">promised that he could feast with the Night’s Watch in the Great Hall. “Summer,” </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he called. The wolf bounded up on the bed. Bran hugged him so hard he could feel </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the hot breath on his cheek. “I can ride now,” he whispered to his friend. “We can </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">go hunting in the woods soon, wait and see.” After a time he slept. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">In his dream he was climbing again, pulling himself up an ancient windowless </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tower, his fingers forcing themselves between blackened stones, his feet scrabbling </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">for purchase. Higher and higher he climbed, through the clouds and into the night </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sky, and still the tower rose before him. When he paused to look down, his head </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swam dizzily and he felt his fingers slipping. Bran cried out and clung for dear life. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The earth was a thousand miles beneath him and he could not fly. <i>He could not fly</i>. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">He waited until his heart had stopped pounding, until he could breathe, and he </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">began to climb again. There was no way to go but up. Far above him, outlined </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">against a vast pale moon, he thought he could see the shapes of gargoyles. His arms </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were sore and aching, but he dared not rest. He forced himself to climb faster. The </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">gargoyles watched him ascend. Their eyes glowed red as hot coals in a brazier. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Perhaps once they had been lions, but now they were twisted and grotesque. Bran </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">could hear them whispering to each other in soft stone voices terrible to hear. He </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">must not listen, he told himself, he must not hear, so long as he did not hear them he </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">was safe. But when the gargoyles pulled themselves loose from the stone and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">padded down the side of the tower to where Bran clung, he knew he was not safe </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">after all. “I didn’t hear,” he wept as they came closer and closer, “I didn’t, I didn’t.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He woke gasping, lost in darkness, and saw a vast shadow looming over him. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“I didn’t hear,” he whispered, trembling in fear, but then the shadow said “Hodor,” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">and lit the candle by the bedside, and Bran sighed with relief. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Hodor washed the sweat from him with a warm, damp cloth and dressed him </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with deft and gentle hands. When it was time, he carried him down to the Great </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Hall, where a long trestle table had been set up near the fire. The lord’s seat at the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">head of the table had been left empty, but Robb sat to the right of it, with Bran </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">across from him. They ate suckling pig that night, and pigeon pie, and turnips </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">soaking in butter, and afterward the cook had promised honeycombs. Summer </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">snatched table scraps from Bran’s hand, while Grey Wind and Shaggydog fought </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">over a bone in the corner. Winterfell’s dogs would not come near the hall now. Bran </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="588" height="22" font="2">had found that strange at first, but he was growing used to it. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Yoren was senior among the black brothers, so the steward had seated him </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">between Robb and Maester Luwin. The old man had a sour smell, as if he had not </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">washed in a long time. He ripped at the meat with his teeth, cracked the ribs to suck </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">out the marrow from the bones, and shrugged at the mention of Jon Snow. “Ser </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Alliser’s bane,” he grunted, and two of his companions shared a laugh that Bran did </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">not understand. But when Robb asked for news of their uncle Benjen, the black </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="306" height="22" font="2">brothers grew ominously quiet. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="251" height="22" font="2">“What is it?” Bran asked. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Yoren wiped his fingers on his vest. “There’s hard news, m’lords, and a cruel </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">way to pay you for your meat and mead, but the man as asks the question must bear </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">the answer. Stark’s gone.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">One of the other men said, “The Old Bear sent him out to look for Waymar </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">Royce, and he’s late returning, my lord.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="459" height="22" font="2">“Too long,” Yoren said. “Most like he’s dead.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My uncle is not dead,” Robb Stark said loudly, anger in his tones. He rose </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">from the bench and laid his hand on the hilt of his sword. “Do you hear me?  <i>My </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>uncle is not dead!</i>” His voice rang against the stone walls, and Bran was suddenly </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">afraid. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Old sour-smelling Yoren looked up at Robb, unimpressed. “Whatever you </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">say, m’lord,” he said. He sucked at a piece of meat between his teeth. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The youngest of the black brothers shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “There’s </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not a man on the Wall knows the haunted forest better than Benjen Stark. He’ll find </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">his way back.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Well,” said Yoren, “maybe he will and maybe he won’t. Good men have </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="506" height="22" font="2">gone into those woods before, and never come out.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">All Bran could think of was Old Nan’s story of the Others and the last hero, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hounded through the white woods by dead men and spiders big as hounds. He was </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">afraid for a moment, until he remembered how that story ended. “The children will </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="487" height="22" font="2">help him,” he blurted, “the children of the forest!” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy sniggered, and Maester Luwin said, “Bran, the children of the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">forest have been dead and gone for thousands of years. All that is left of them are </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">the faces in the trees.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Down here, might be that’s true, Maester,” Yoren said, “but up past the Wall, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="762" height="22" font="2">who’s to say? Up there, a man can’t always tell what’s alive and what’s dead.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">That night, after the plates had been cleared, Robb carried Bran up to bed </text>
</page>
<page number="199" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">himself. Grey Wind led the way, and Summer came close behind. His brother was </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">strong for his age, and Bran was as light as a bundle of rags, but the stairs were </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">steep and dark, and Robb was breathing hard by the time they reached the top. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He put Bran into bed, covered him with blankets, and blew out the candle. For </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a time Robb sat beside him in the dark. Bran wanted to talk to him, but he did not </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">know what to say. “We’ll find a horse for you, I promise,” Robb whispered at last. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="460" height="22" font="2">“Are they ever coming back?” Bran asked him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Robb said with such hope in his voice that Bran knew he was hearing </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his brother and not just Robb the Lord. “Mother will be home soon. Maybe we can </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">ride out to meet her when she comes. Wouldn’t that surprise her, to see you </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">ahorse?” Even in the dark room, Bran could feel his brother’s smile. “And </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">afterward, we’ll ride north to see the Wall. We won’t even tell Jon we’re coming, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="629" height="22" font="2">we’ll just be there one day, you and me. It will be an adventure.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“An adventure,” Bran repeated wistfully. He heard his brother sob. The room </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was so dark he could not see the tears on Robb’s face, so he reached out and found </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">his hand. Their fingers twined together. </text>

<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Some dates, perhaps? I have some very fine persimmons as well. Wine no longer </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of iced milk, sweetened </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.” </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">chest. Thick, moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot, airless warrens to jostle for </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be found. </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="528" height="22" font="2">“That would be most kind,” Ned said, seating himself. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Pycelle lifted a tiny silver bell with thumb and forefinger and tinkled it gently. </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">A slender young serving girl hurried into the solar. “Iced milk for the King’s Hand </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="593" height="22" font="2">and myself, if you would be so kind, child. Well sweetened.” </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">As the girl went to fetch their drinks, the Grand Maester knotted his fingers </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">together and rested his hands on his stomach. “The smallfolk say that the last year </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of summer is always the hottest. It is not so, yet ofttimes it feels that way, does it </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">not? On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows.” The heavy </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">jeweled chain around the old man’s neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“To be sure, King Maekar’s summer was hotter than this one, and near as long. </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter. Still, the heat was </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fierce while it lasted. Oldtown steamed and sweltered by day and came alive only </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">by night. We would walk in the gardens by the river and argue about the gods. I </text>

<text top="1035" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Pycelle’s eyes were so heavily lidded he looked half-asleep. “My pardons, Lord </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The serving girl placed the tray between them, and Pycelle gave her a smile. “Sweet </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">child.” He lifted a cup, tasted, nodded. “Thank you. You may go.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">When the girl had taken her leave,  Pycelle peered at Ned through pale, </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I did.” Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold, but </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="218" height="22" font="2">oversweet to his taste. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“If truth be told, the Hand had not seemed quite himself for some time,” </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Pycelle said. “We had sat together on council many a year, he and I, and the signs </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">were there to read, but I put them down to the great burdens he had borne so </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">faithfully for so long. Those broad shoulders were weighed down by all the cares of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the realm, and more besides. His son was ever sickly, and his lady wife so anxious </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">that she would scarcely let the boy out of her sight. It was enough to weary even a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">strong man, and the Lord Jon was not young. Small wonder if he seemed </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">melancholy and tired. Or so I thought at the time. Yet now I am less certain.” He </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">gave a ponderous shake of his head. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="420" height="22" font="2">“What can you tell me of his final illness?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The Grand Maester spread his hands in a gesture of helpless sorrow. “He </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">came to me one day asking after a certain book, as hale and healthy as ever, though </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it did seem to me that something was troubling him deeply. The next morning he </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was twisted over in pain, too sick to rise from bed. Maester Colemon thought it was </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a chill on the stomach. The weather had been hot, and the Hand often iced his wine, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">which can upset the digestion. When Lord Jon continued to weaken, I went to him </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="599" height="22" font="2">myself, but the gods did not grant me the power to save him.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="514" height="22" font="2">“I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Grand Maester’s nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. “I did, and I </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="597" height="22" font="2">“Did Lord Arryn say anything to you during his final hours?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Pycelle wrinkled his brow. “In the last stage of his fever, the Hand called out </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the name <i>Robert</i> several times, but whether he was asking for his son or for the king </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I could not say. Lady Lysa would not permit the boy to enter the sickroom, for fear </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that he too might  be taken ill. The king did come, and he sat beside the bed for </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hours, talking and joking of times long past in hopes of raising Lord Jon’s spirits. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="268" height="22" font="2">His love was fierce to see.” </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he should not suffer. Just before he closed his eyes for the last time, he whispered </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son. <i>The seed is strong</i>, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he said. At the end, his speech was too slurred to comprehend. Death did not come </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned took another swallow of milk, trying not to gag on the sweetness of it. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="792" height="22" font="2">“Did it seem to you that there was anything unnatural about Lord Arryn’s death?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Unnatural?” The aged maester’s voice was thin as a whisper. “No, I could </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not say so. Sad, for a certainty. Yet in its own way, death is the most natural thing </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">of all, Lord Eddard. Jon Arryn rests easy now, his burdens lifted at last.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“This illness that took him,” said Ned. “Had you ever seen its like before, in </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="124" height="22" font="2">other men?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Near forty years I have been Grand Maester of the Seven Kingdoms,” </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Pycelle replied. “Under our good King Robert, and Aerys Targaryen before him, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and his father Jaehaerys the Second before him, and even for a few short months </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">under Jaehaerys’s father, Aegon the Fortunate, the Fifth of His Name. I have seen </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">more of illness than I care to remember, my lord. I will tell you this: Every case is </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="806" height="22" font="2">different, and every case is alike. Lord Jon’s death was no stranger than any other.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="294" height="22" font="2">“His wife thought otherwise.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Grand Maester nodded. “I recall now, the widow is sister to your own </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">noble wife. If an old man may be forgiven his blunt speech, let me say that grief can </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">derange even the strongest and most disciplined of minds, and the Lady Lysa was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">never that. Since her last stillbirth, she has seen enemies in every shadow, and the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="516" height="22" font="2">death of her lord husband left her shattered and lost.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="642" height="22" font="2">“So you are quite certain that Jon Arryn died of a sudden illness?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I am,” Pycelle replied gravely. “If not illness, my good lord, what else could </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">it be?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="324" height="22" font="2">“Poison,” Ned suggested quietly. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open. The aged maester shifted uncomfortably in </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his seat. “A disturbing thought. We are not the Free Cities, where such things are </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">common. Grand Maester Aethelmure wrote that all men carry murder in their </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hearts, yet even so, the poisoner is beneath contempt.” He fell silent for a moment, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his eyes lost in thought. “What you suggest is possible, my lord, yet I do not think it </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">likely. Every hedge maester knows the common poisons, and Lord Arryn displayed </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">none of the signs. And the Hand was loved by all. What sort of monster in man’s </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">flesh would dare to murder such a noble lord?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="541" height="22" font="2">“I have heard it said that poison is a woman’s weapon.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Pycelle stroked his beard thoughtfully. “It is said. Women, cravens. . . and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">eunuchs.” He cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phelm onto the rushes. </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Above them, a raven cawed loudly in the rookery. “The Lord Varys was born a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="653" height="22" font="2">slave in Lys, did you know? Put not your trust in spiders, my lord.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That was scarcely anything Ned needed to be told; there was something about </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Varys that made his flesh crawl. “I will remember that, Maester. And I thank you </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">for your help. I have taken enough of your time.” He stood. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle pushed himself up from his chair slowly and escorted </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Ned to the door. “I hope I have helped in some small way to put your mind at ease. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="630" height="22" font="2">If there is any other service I might perform, you need only ask.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“One thing,” Ned told him. “I should be curious to examine the book that you </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="334" height="22" font="2">lent Jon the day before he fell ill.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I fear you would find it of little interest,” Pycelle said. “It was a ponderous </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great houses.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="286" height="22" font="2">“Still, I should like to see it.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The old man opened the door. “As you wish. I have it here somewhere. When </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">I find it, I shall have it sent to your chambers straightaway.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“You have been most courteous,” Ned told him. Then, almost as an </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">afterthought, he said, “One last question, if you would be so kind. You mentioned </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that the king was at Lord Arryn’s bedside when he died. I wonder, was the queen </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">with him?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Why, no,” Pycelle said. “She and the children were making the journey to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock, in company with her father. Lord Tywin had brought a retinue to the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">city for the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s name day, no doubt hoping to see his son </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Jaime win the champion’s crown. In that he was sadly disappointed. It fell to me to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">send the queen word of Lord Arryn’s sudden death. Never have I sent off a bird </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">with a heavier heart.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Dark wings, dark words,” Ned murmured. It was a proverb Old Nan had </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="200" height="22" font="2">taught him as a boy. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So the fishwives say,” Grand Maester Pycelle agreed, “but we know it is not </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">always so. When Maester Luwin’s bird brought the word about your Bran, the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">message lifted every true heart in the castle, did it not?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="229" height="22" font="2">“As you say, Maester.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The gods are merciful.” Pycelle bowed his head. “Come to me as often as </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">you like, Lord Eddard. I am here to serve.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="515" height="22" font="4"><i>Yes</i>, Ned thought as the door swung shut, <i>but whom? </i></text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">On the way back to his chambers, he came upon his daughter Arya on the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">winding steps of the Tower of the Hand, windmilling her arms as she struggled to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">balance on one leg. The rough stone had scuffed her bare feet. Ned stopped and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="420" height="22" font="2">looked at her. “Arya, what are you doing?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.” Her hands flailed </text>
</page>
<page number="204" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">at the air to steady herself. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="413" height="22" font="2">Ned had to smile. “Which toe?” he teased. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>Any  </i>toe,” Arya said, exasperated with the question. She hopped from her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="717" height="22" font="2">right leg to her left, swaying dangerously before she regained her balance. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Must you do your standing here?” he asked. “It’s a long hard fall down these </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">steps.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Syrio says a water dancer <i>never</i> falls.” She lowered her leg to stand on two </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">feet. “Father, will Bran come and live with us now?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Not for a long time, sweet one,” he told her. “He needs to win his strength </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">back.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="544" height="22" font="2">Arya bit her lip. “What will Bran do when he’s of age?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned knelt beside her. “He has years to find that answer, Arya. For now, it is </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">enough to know that he will live.” The night the bird had come from Winterfell, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark had taken the girls to the castle godswood, an acre of elm and alder </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and black cottonwood overlooking the river. The heart tree there was a great oak, its </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ancient limbs overgrown with smokeberry vines; they knelt before it to offer their </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thanksgiving, as if it had been a weirwood. Sansa drifted to sleep as the moon rose, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Arya several hours later, curling up in the grass under Ned’s cloak. All through the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dark hours he kept his vigil alone. When dawn broke over the city, the dark red </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">blooms of dragon’s breath surrounded the girls where they lay. “I dreamed of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">Bran,” Sansa had whispered to him. “I saw him smiling.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“He was going to be a knight,” Arya was saying now. “A knight of the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. “Yet someday he may be the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council. He might raise castles like </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the Sunset Sea,  or enter your mother’s </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Faith and become the High Septon.”<i>But he will never run beside his wolf again</i>, he </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thought with a sadness too deep for words, <i>or lie with a woman, or hold his own son </i></text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="4"><i>in his arms</i>. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya cocked her head to one side. “Can I be a king’s councillor and build </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="375" height="22" font="2">castles and become the High Septon?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You,” Ned said, kissing her lightly on the brow, “will marry a king and rule </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his castle, and your sons will be knights and princes and lords and, yes, perhaps </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">even a High Septon.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya screwed up her face. “No,” she said, “that’s <i>Sansa</i>.” She folded up her </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="646" height="22" font="2">right leg and resumed her balancing. Ned sighed and left her there. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Inside his chambers, he stripped off his sweat-stained silks and sluiced cold </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">water over his head from the basin beside the bed. Alyn entered as he was drying </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="718" height="22" font="2">his face. “My lord,” he said, “Lord Baelish is without and begs audience.” </text>

<page number="205" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Escort him to my solar,” Ned said, reaching for a fresh tunic, the lightest </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="410" height="22" font="2">linen he could find. “I’ll see him at once.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger was perched on the window seat when Ned entered, watching the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">knights of the Kingsguard practice at swords in the yard below. “If only old </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Selmy’s mind were as nimble as his blade,” he said wistfully, “our council meetings </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">would be a good deal livelier.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Ser Barristan is as valiant and honorable as any man in King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ned had come to have a deep respect for the aged, white-haired Lord Commander </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">of the Kingsguard. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And as tiresome,” Littlefinger added, “though I daresay he should do well in </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the tourney. Last year he unhorsed the Hound, and it was only four years ago that </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">he was champion.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The question of who might win the tourney interested Eddard Stark not in the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">least. “Is there a reason for this visit, Lord Petyr, or are you here simply to enjoy the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="247" height="22" font="2">view from my window?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger smiled. “I promised Cat I would help you in your inquiries, and so </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="82" height="22" font="2">I have.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That took Ned aback. Promise or no promise, he could not find it in him to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">trust Lord Petyr Baelish, who struck him as too clever by half. “You have </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">something for me?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Someone</i>,” Littlefinger corrected. “Four someones, if truth be told. Had you </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">thought to question the Hand’s servants?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned. “Would that I could. Lady Arryn took her household back to the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Eyrie.” Lysa had done him no favor in that regard. All those who had stood closest </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to her husband had gone with her when she fled: Jon’s maester, his steward, the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">captain of his guard, his knights and retainers. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Most </i>of her household,” Littlefinger said, “not all. A few remain. A pregnant </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">kitchen girl hastily wed to one of Lord Renly’s grooms, a stablehand who joined the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">City Watch, a potboy discharged from service for theft, and Lord Arryn’s squire.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“His squire?” Ned was pleasantly surprised. A man’s squire often knew a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="364" height="22" font="2">great deal of his comings and goings. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ser Hugh of the Vale,” Littlefinger named him. “The king knighted the boy </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">after Lord Arryn’s death.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="491" height="22" font="2">“I shall send for him,” Ned said. “And the others.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger winced. “My lord, step over here to the window, if you would be </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">so kind.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="85" height="22" font="2">“Why?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="359" height="22" font="2">“Come, and I’ll show you, my lord.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Frowning, Ned crossed to the window. Petyr Baelish made a casual gesture. </text>

<text top="197" left="54" width="584" height="22" font="2">above the stables. The guardsman leaning on the ramparts?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="558" height="22" font="2">Ned saw the man. “Another of the eunuch’s whisperers?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No, this one belongs to the queen. Notice that he enjoys a fine view of the </text>

<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Ned moved away from the window. “Is everyone someone’s informer in this cursed </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Scarcely,” said Littlefinger. He counted on the fingers on his hand. “Why, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there’s me, you, the king. . . although, come to think on it, the king tells the queen </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">much too much, and I’m less than certain about you.” He stood up. “Is there a man </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="525" height="22" font="2">in your service that you trust utterly and completely?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="167" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” said Ned. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“In that case, I have a delightful palace in Valyria that I would dearly love to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sell you,” Littlefinger said with a mocking smile. “The wiser answer was  <i>no</i>,  my </text>

<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lord Petyr,” Ned called after him. “I. . . am grateful for your help. Perhaps I </text>

<text top="290" left="97" width="776" height="22" font="2">entered the practice yard. “Your feet should be farther apart,” he urged. “You </text>

<text top="428" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon turned. Through the eye slit of his helm, he beheld the fattest boy he had </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ever seen standing in the door of the armory. By the look of him, he must have </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">weighed twenty stone. The fur collar of his embroidered surcoat was lost beneath </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his chins. Pale eyes moved nervously in a great round moon of a face, and plump </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sweaty fingers wiped themselves on the velvet of his doublet. “They . . . they told </text>

<text top="593" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A lordling,” Pyp observed to Jon. “Southron, most like near Highgarden.” </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Pyp had traveled the Seven Kingdoms with a mummers’ troupe, and bragged that </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he could tell what you were and where you’d been born just from the sound of your </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">voice. </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A striding huntsman had been worked in scarlet thread upon the breast of the </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fat boy’s fur-trimmed surcoat. Jon did not recognize the sigil. Ser Alliser Thorne </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">looked over his new charge and said, “It would seem they have run short of </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us pigs to man the Wall. Is fur </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="507" height="22" font="2">and velvet your notion of armor, my Lord of Ham?” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was soon revealed that the new recruit had brought his own armor with him; </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">padded doublet, boiled leather, mail and plate and helm, even a great wood-and-</text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leather shield blazoned with the same striding huntsman he wore on his surcoat. As </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">none of it was black, however, Ser Alliser insisted that he reequip himself from the </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">armory. That took half the morning. His girth required Donal Noye to take apart a </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mail hauberk and refit it with leather panels at the sides. To get a helm over his </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">head the armorer had to detach the visor. His leathers bound so tightly around his </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">legs and under his arms that he could scarcely move. Dressed for battle, the new </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">boy looked like an overcooked sausage about to burst its skin. “Let us hope you are </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">not as inept as you look,” Ser Alliser said. “Halder, see what Ser Piggy can do.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow winced. Halder had been born in a quarry and apprenticed as a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stonemason. He was sixteen, tall and muscular, and his blows were as hard as any </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="814" height="22" font="2">Jon had ever felt. “This will be uglier than a whore’s ass,” Pyp muttered, and it was. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The fight lasted less than a minute before the fat boy was on the ground, his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whole body shaking as blood leaked through his shattered helm and between his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pudgy fingers. “I yield,” he shrilled. “No more, I yield, don’t hit me.” Rast and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">some of the other boys were laughing. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Even then, Ser Alliser would not call an end. “On your feet, Ser Piggy,” he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">called. “Pick up your sword.” When the boy continued to cling to the ground, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Thorne gestured to Halder. “Hit him with the flat  of your blade until he finds his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet.” Halder delivered a tentative smack to his foe’s upraised cheeks. “You can hit </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">harder than that,” Thorne taunted. Halder took hold of his longsword with both </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hands and brought it down so hard the blow split leather, even on the flat. The new </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">boy screeched in pain. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow took a step forward. Pyp laid a mailed hand on his arm. “Jon, <i>no</i>,” </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="681" height="22" font="2">the small boy whispered with an anxious glance at Ser Alliser Thorne. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“On your feet,” Thorne repeated. The fat boy struggled to rise, slipped, and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fell heavily again. “Ser Piggy is starting to grasp the notion,” Ser Alliser observed. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">“Again.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Halder lifted the sword for another blow. “Cut us off a ham!” Rast urged, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="96" height="22" font="2">laughing. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="437" height="22" font="2">Jon shook off Pyp’s hand. “Halder, <i>enough</i>.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="283" height="22" font="2">Halder looked to Ser Alliser. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Bastard speaks and the peasants tremble,” the master-at-arms said in that </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sharp, cold voice of his. “I remind you that I am the master-at-arms here, Lord </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">Snow.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Look at him, Halder,” Jon urged, ignoring Thorne as best he could. “There’s </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="711" height="22" font="2">no honor in beating a fallen foe. He yielded.” He knelt beside the fat boy. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">Halder lowered his sword. “He yielded,” he echoed. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Alliser’s onyx eyes were fixed on Jon Snow. “It would seem our Bastard </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is in love,” he said as Jon helped the fat boy to his feet. “Show me your steel, Lord </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">Snow.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon drew his longsword. He dared defy Ser Alliser only to a point, and he </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">feared he was well beyond it now. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Thorne smiled. “The Bastard wishes to defend his lady love, so we shall make </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">an exercise of it. Rat, Pimple, help our Stone Head here.” Rast and Albett moved to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">join Halder. “Three of you ought to be sufficient to make Lady Piggy squeal. All </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">you need do is get past the Bastard.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Stay behind me,” Jon said to the fat boy. Ser Alliser had often sent two foes </text>

<page number="209" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">against him, but never three. He knew he would likely go to sleep bruised and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">bloody tonight. He braced himself for the assault. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Suddenly Pyp was beside him. “Three to two will make for better sport,” the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">small boy said cheerfully. He dropped his visor and slid out his sword. Before Jon </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="640" height="22" font="2">could even think to protest, Grenn had stepped up to make a third. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The yard had grown deathly quiet. Jon could feel Ser Alliser’s eyes. “Why are </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you waiting?” he asked Rast and the others in a voice gone deceptively soft, but it </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="634" height="22" font="2">was Jon who moved first. Halder barely got his sword up in time. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon drove him backward, attacking with every blow, keeping the older boy on </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the heels.  <i>Know your foe</i>,  Ser Rodrik had taught him once; Jon knew Halder, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brutally strong but short of patience, with no taste for defense. Frustrate him, and he </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">would leave himself open, as certain as sunset. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The clang of steel echoed through the yard as the others joined battle around </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him. Jon blocked a savage cut at his head, the shock of impact running up his arm </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as the swords crashed together. He slammed a sidestroke into Halder’s ribs, and was </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">rewarded with a muffled grunt of pain. The counterstroke caught Jon on the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shoulder. Chainmail crunched, and pain flared up his neck, but for an instant Halder </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was unbalanced. Jon cut his left leg from under him, and he fell with a curse and a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">crash. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Grenn was standing his ground as Jon had taught him, giving Albett more than </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he cared for, but Pyp was hard-pressed. Rast had two years and forty pounds on </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him. Jon stepped up behind him and rang the raper’s helm like a bell. As Rast went </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">reeling, Pyp slid in under his guard, knocked him down, and leveled a blade at his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">throat. By then Jon had moved on. Facing two swords, Albett backed away. “I </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="186" height="22" font="2">yield,” he shouted. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Alliser Thorne surveyed the scene with disgust. “The mummer’s farce has </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="750" height="22" font="2">gone on long enough for today.” He walked away. The session was at an end. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dareon helped Halder to his feet. The quarryman’s son wrenched off his helm </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="773" height="22" font="2">and threw it across the yard. “For an instant, I thought I finally had you, Snow.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“For an instant, you did,” Jon replied. Under his mail and leather, his shoulder </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was throbbing. He sheathed his sword and tried to remove his helm, but when he </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">raised his arm, the pain made him grit his teeth. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Let me,” a voice said. Thick-fingered hands unfastened helm from gorget </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="412" height="22" font="2">and lifted it off gently. “Did he hurt you?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I’ve been bruised before.” He touched his shoulder and winced. The yard </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">was emptying around them. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Blood matted the fat boy’s hair where Halder had split his helm asunder. “My </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">name is Samwell Tarly, of Horn. . .” He stopped and licked his lips. “I mean, I <i>was</i> </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of Horn Hill, until I. . . left. I’ve come to take the black. My father is Lord Randyll, </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a bannerman to the Tyrells of Highgarden. I used to be his heir, only. . .” His voice </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">trailed off. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">“I’m Jon Snow, Ned Stark’s bastard, of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly nodded. “I. . . if you want, you can call me Sam. My mother </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">calls me Sam.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You can call  <i>him</i>  Lord Snow,” Pyp said as he came up to join them. “You </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="464" height="22" font="2">don’t want to know what his mother calls him.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="426" height="22" font="2">“These two are Grenn and Pypar,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="329" height="22" font="2">“Grenn’s the ugly one,” Pyp said. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="749" height="22" font="2">Grenn scowled. “You’re uglier than me. At least I don’t have ears like a bat.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="495" height="22" font="2">“My thanks to all of you,” the fat boy said gravely. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="524" height="22" font="2">“Why didn’t you get up and fight?” Grenn demanded. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I wanted to, truly. I just. . . I couldn’t. I didn’t want him to hit me anymore.” </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="803" height="22" font="2">He looked at the ground. “I. . . I fear I’m a coward. My lord father always said so.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Grenn looked thunderstruck. Even Pyp had no words to say to that, and Pyp </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">had words for everything. What sort of man would proclaim himself a coward? </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly must have read their thoughts on their faces. His eyes met </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Jon’s and darted away, quick as frightened animals. “I. . . I’m sorry,” he said. “I </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="706" height="22" font="2">don’t mean to. . . to be like I am.” He walked heavily toward the armory. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="743" height="22" font="2">Jon called after him. “You were hurt,” he said. “Tomorrow you’ll do better.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Sam looked mournfully back over one shoulder. “No I won’t,” he said, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="386" height="22" font="2">blinking back tears. “I never do better.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">When he was gone, Grenn frowned. “Nobody likes cravens,” he said </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">uncomfortably. “I wish we hadn’t helped him. What if they think we’re craven </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="58" height="22" font="2">too?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="462" height="22" font="2">“You’re too stupid to be craven,” Pyp told him. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="230" height="22" font="2">“I am not,” Grenn said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yes you are. If a bear attacked you in the woods, you’d be too stupid to run </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">away.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I would not,” Grenn insisted. “I’d run away faster than you.” He stopped </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">suddenly, scowling when he saw Pyp’s grin and realized what he’d just said. His </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">thick neck flushed a dark red. Jon left them there arguing as he returned to the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">armory, hung up his sword, and stripped off his battered armor. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">Life at Castle Black followed certain patterns; the mornings were for </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">swordplay, the afternoons for work. The black brothers set new recruits to many </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">different tasks, to learn where their skills lay. Jon cherished the rare afternoons </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he was sent out with Ghost ranging at his side to bring back game for the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lord Commander’s table, but for every day spent hunting, he gave a dozen to Donal </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Noye in the armory, spinning the whetstone while the one-armed smith sharpened </text>

<page number="211" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">axes grown dull from use, or pumping the bellows as Noye hammered out a new </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sword. Other times he ran messages, stood at guard, mucked out stables, fletched </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">arrows, assisted Maester Aemon with his birds or Bowen Marsh with his counts and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">inventories. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That afternoon, the watch commander sent him to the winch cage with four </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">barrels of fresh-crushed stone, to scatter gravel over the icy footpaths atop the Wall. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">It was lonely and boring work, even with Ghost along for company, but Jon found </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he did not mind. On a clear day you could see half the world from the top of the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Wall, and the air was always cold and bracing. He could think here, and he found </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">himself thinking of Samwell Tarly. . . and, oddly, of Tyrion Lannister. He wondered </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">what Tyrion would have made of the fat boy. <i>Most men would rather deny a hard </i></text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>truth than face it</i>, the dwarf had told him, grinning. The world was full of cravens </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">who pretended to be heroes; it took a queer sort of courage to admit to cowardice as </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly had. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His sore shoulder made the work go slowly. It was late afternoon before Jon </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">finished graveling the paths. He lingered on high to watch the sun go down, turning </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the western sky the color of blood. Finally, as dusk was settling over the north, Jon </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rolled the empty barrels back into the cage and signaled the winch men to lower </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The evening meal was almost done by the time he and Ghost reached the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">common hall. A group of the black brothers were dicing over mulled wine near the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fire. His friends were at the bench nearest the west wall, laughing. Pyp was in the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">middle of a story. The mummer’s boy with the big ears was a born liar with a </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hundred different voices, and he did not tell his tales so much as live them, playing </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">all the parts as needed, a king one moment and a swineherd the next. When he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">turned into an alehouse girl or a virgin princess, he used a high falsetto voice that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">reduced them all to tears of helpless laughter, and his eunuchs were always eerily </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">accurate caricatures of Ser Alliser. Jon took as much pleasure from Pyp’s antics as </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">anyone. . . yet that night he turned away and went instead to the end of the bench, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="676" height="22" font="2">where Samwell Tarly sat alone, as far from the others as he could get. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He was finishing the last of the pork pie the cooks had served up for supper </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">when Jon sat down across from him. The fat boy’s eyes widened at the sight of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">Ghost. “Is that a wolf?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A direwolf,” Jon said. “His name is Ghost. The direwolf is the sigil of my </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="163" height="22" font="2">father’s House.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="496" height="22" font="2">“Ours is a striding huntsman,” Samwell Tarly said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="225" height="22" font="2">“Do you like to hunt?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The fat boy shuddered. “I hate it.” He looked as though he was going to cry </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">again. </text>
</page>
<page number="212" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="738" height="22" font="2">“What’s wrong now?” Jon asked him. “Why are you always so frightened?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sam stared at the last of his pork pie and gave a feeble shake of his head, too </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scared even to talk. A burst of laughter filled the hall. Jon heard Pyp squeaking in a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">high voice. He stood. “Let’s go outside.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The round fat face looked up at him, suspicious. “Why? What will we do </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">outside?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="435" height="22" font="2">“Talk,” Jon said. “Have you seen the Wall?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I’m fat, not blind,” Samwell Tarly said. “Of course I saw it, it’s seven </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hundred feet high.” Yet he stood up all the same, wrapped a fur-lined cloak over his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shoulders, and followed Jon from the common hall, still wary, as if he suspected </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">some cruel trick was waiting for him in the night. Ghost padded along beside them. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“I never thought it would be like this,” Sam said as they walked, his words steaming </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the cold air. Already he was huffing and puffing as he tried to keep up. “All the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">buildings are falling down, and it’s so. . . so. . .” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Cold?” A hard frost was settling over the castle, and Jon could hear the soft </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="390" height="22" font="2">crunch of grey weeds beneath his boots. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sam nodded miserably. “I hate the cold,” he said. “Last night I woke up in the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dark and the fire had gone out and I was certain I was going to freeze to death by </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="104" height="22" font="2">morning.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“It must have been warmer where you come from.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I never saw snow until last month. We were crossing the barrowlands, me </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the men my father sent to see me north, and this white stuff began to fall, like a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soft rain. At first I thought it was so beautiful, like feathers drifting from the sky, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but it kept on and on, until I was frozen to the bone. The men had crusts of snow in </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">their beards and more  on their shoulders, and still it kept coming. I was afraid it </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">would never end.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="115" height="22" font="2">Jon smiled. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The Wall loomed before them, glimmering palely in the light of the half </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moon. In the sky above, the stars burned clear and sharp. “Are they going to make </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">me go up there?” Sam asked. His face curdled like old milk as he looked at the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="510" height="22" font="2">great wooden stairs. “I’ll die if I have to climb that.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="709" height="22" font="2">“There’s a winch,” Jon said, pointing. “They can draw you up in a cage.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="488" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly sniffled. “I don’t like high places.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was too much. Jon frowned, incredulous. “Are you afraid of <i>everything</i>?” he </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">asked. “I don’t understand. If you are truly so craven, why are you here? Why </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="483" height="22" font="2">would a coward want to join the Night’s Watch?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly looked at him for a long moment, and his round face seemed to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cave in on itself. He sat down on the frost-covered ground and began to cry, huge </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">choking sobs that made his whole body shake. Jon Snow could only stand and </text>
</page>
<page number="213" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">watch. Like the snowfall on the barrowlands, it seemed the tears would never end. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was Ghost who knew what to do. Silent as shadow, the pale direwolf moved </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">closer and began to lick the warm tears off Samwell Tarly’s face. The fat boy cried </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="701" height="22" font="2">out, startled. . . and somehow, in a heartbeat, his sobs turned to laughter. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow laughed with him. Afterward they sat on the frozen ground, huddled </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in their cloaks with Ghost between them. Jon told the story of how he and Robb had </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">found the pups newborn in the late summer snows. It seemed a thousand years ago </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="551" height="22" font="2">now. Before long he found himself talking of Winterfell. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Sometimes I dream about it,” he said. “I’m walking down this long empty </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hall. My voice echoes all around, but no one answers, so I walk faster, opening </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">doors, shouting names. I don’t even know who I’m looking for. Most nights it’s my </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father, but sometimes it’s Robb instead, or my little sister Arya, or my uncle.” The </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thought of Benjen Stark saddened him; his uncle was still missing. The Old Bear </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had sent out rangers in search of him. Ser Jaremy Rykker had led two sweeps, and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Quorin Halfhand had gone forth from the Shadow Tower, but they’d found nothing </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">aside from a few blazes in the trees that his uncle had left to mark his way. In the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stony highlands to the northwest, the marks stopped abruptly and all trace of Ben </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="154" height="22" font="2">Stark vanished. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">“Do you ever find anyone in your dream?” Sam asked. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon shook his head. “No one. The castle is always empty.” He had never told </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">anyone of the dream, and he did not understand why he was telling Sam now, yet </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">somehow it felt good to talk of it. “Even the ravens are gone from the rookery, and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the stables are full of bones. That always scares me. I start to run then, throwing </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">open doors, climbing the tower three steps at a time, screaming for someone, for </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">anyone. And then I find myself in front of the door to the crypts. It’s black inside, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and I can see the steps spiraling down. Somehow I know I have to go down there, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but I don’t want to. I’m afraid of what might be waiting for me. The old Kings of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Winter are down there, sitting on their thrones with stone wolves at their feet and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">iron swords across their laps, but it’s not them I’m afraid of. I scream that I’m not a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Stark, that this isn’t my place, but it’s no good, I have to go anyway, so I start </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down, feeling the walls as I descend, with no torch to light the way. It gets darker </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and darker, until I want to scream.” He stopped, frowning, embarrassed. “That’s </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">when I always wake.” His skin cold and clammy, shivering in the darkness of his </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">cell. Ghost would leap up beside him, his warmth as comforting as daybreak. He </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would go back to sleep with his face pressed into the direwolf s shaggy white fur. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="406" height="22" font="2">“Do you dream of Horn Hill?” Jon asked. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No.” Sam’s mouth grew tight and hard. “I hated it there.” He scratched Ghost </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">behind the ear, brooding, and Jon let the silence breathe. After a long while </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly began to talk, and Jon Snow listened quietly, and learned how it was </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="543" height="22" font="2">that a self-confessed coward found himself on the Wall. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Tarlys were a family old in honor, bannermen to Mace Tyrell, Lord of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Highgarden and Warden of the South. The eldest son of Lord Randyll Tarly, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Samwell was born heir to rich lands, a strong keep, and a storied two-handed </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">greatsword named Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel and passed down from </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="364" height="22" font="2">father to son near five hundred years. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Whatever pride his lord father might have felt at Samwell’s birth vanished as </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the boy grew up plump, soft, and awkward. Sam loved to listen to music and make </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his own songs, to wear soft velvets, to play in the castle kitchen beside the cooks, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">drinking in the rich smells as he snitched lemon cakes and blueberry tarts. His </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">passions were books and kittens and dancing, clumsy as he was. But he grew ill at </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">the sight of blood, and wept to see even a chicken slaughtered. A dozen masters-at-</text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">arms came and went at Horn Hill, trying to turn Samwell into the knight his father </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wanted. The boy was cursed and caned, slapped and starved. One man had him </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">sleep in his chainmail to make him more martial. Another dressed him in his </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mother’s clothing and paraded him through the bailey to shame him into valor. He </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">only grew fatter and more frightened, until Lord Randyll’s disappointment turned to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">anger and then to loathing. “One time,” Sam confided, his voice dropping from a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whisper, “two men came to the castle, warlocks from Qarth with white skin and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blue lips. They slaughtered a bull aurochs and made me bathe in the hot blood, but </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it didn’t make me brave as they’d promised. I got sick and retched. Father had them </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="109" height="22" font="2">scourged.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Finally, after three girls in as many years, Lady Tarly gave her lord husband a </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">second son. From that day, Lord Randyll ignored Sam, devoting all his time to the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">younger boy, a fierce, robust child more to his liking. Samwell had known several </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="494" height="22" font="2">years of sweet peace with his music and his books. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Until the dawn of his fifteenth name day, when he had been awakened to find </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his horse saddled and ready. Three men-at-arms had escorted him into a wood near </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Horn Hill, where his father was skinning a deer. “You are almost a man grown now, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and my heir,” Lord Randyll Tarly had told his eldest son, his long knife laying bare </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the carcass as he spoke. “You have given me no cause to disown you, but neither </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">will I allow you to inherit the land and title that should be Dickon’s. Heartsbane </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">must go to a man strong enough to wield her, and you are not worthy to touch her </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hilt. So I have decided that you shall this day announce that you wish to take the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">black. You will forsake all claim to your brother’s inheritance and start north before </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">evenfall. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If you do not, then on the morrow we shall have a hunt, and somewhere in </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">these woods your horse will stumble, and you will be thrown from the saddle to </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">will truly be that easy, should you think to defy me. Nothing would please me more </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">than to hunt you down like the pig you are.” His arms were red to the elbow as he </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">laid the skinning knife aside. “So. There is your choice. The Night’s Watch”—he </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">reached inside the deer, ripped out its heart, and held it in his fist, red and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">dripping—“or this.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sam told the tale in a calm, dead voice, as if it were something that had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">happened to someone else, not to him. And strangely, Jon thought, he did not weep, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not even once. When he was done, they sat together and listened to the wind for a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">time. There was no other sound in all the world. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="574" height="22" font="2">Finally Jon said, “We should go back to the common hall.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="200" height="22" font="2">“Why?” Sam asked. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon shrugged. “There’s hot cider to drink, or mulled wine if you prefer. Some </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">nights Dareon sings for us, if the mood is on him. He was a singer, before. . . well, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">not truly, but almost, an apprentice singer.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="370" height="22" font="2">“How did he come here?” Sam asked. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Lord Rowan of Goldengrove found him in bed with his daughter. The girl </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was two years older, and Dareon swears she helped him through her window, but </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">under her father’s eye she named it rape, so here he is. When Maester Aemon heard </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">him sing, he said his voice was honey poured over thunder.” Jon smiled. “Toad </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sometimes sings too, if you call it singing. Drinking songs he learned in his father’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">winesink. Pyp says his voice is piss poured over a fart.” They laughed at that </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">together. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I should like to hear them both,” Sam admitted, “but they would not want me </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there.” His face was troubled. “He’s going to make me fight again on the morrow, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">isn’t he?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="302" height="22" font="2">“He is,” Jon was forced to say. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sam got awkwardly to his feet. “I had better try to sleep.” He huddled down in </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="256" height="22" font="2">his cloak and plodded off. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The others were still in the common room when Jon returned, alone but for </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">Ghost. “Where have <i>you</i> been?” Pyp asked. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="285" height="22" font="2">“Talking with Sam,” he said. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He truly is craven,” said Grenn. “At supper, there were still places on the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="678" height="22" font="2">bench when he got his pie, but he was too scared to come sit with us.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The Lord of Ham thinks he’s too good to eat with the likes of us,” suggested </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">Jeren. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I saw him eat a pork pie,” Toad said, smirking. “Do you think it was a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="426" height="22" font="2">brother?” He began to make <i>oink</i>ing noises. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="301" height="22" font="2">“<i>Stop it!</i>” Jon snapped angrily. </text>
</page>
<page number="216" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The other boys fell silent, taken aback by his sudden fury. “Listen to me,” Jon </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">said into the quiet, and he told them how it was going to be. Pyp backed him, as </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he’d known he would, but when Halder spoke up, it was a pleasant surprise. Grenn </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was anxious at the first, but Jon knew the words to move him. One by one the rest </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fell in line. Jon persuaded some, cajoled some, shamed the others, made threats </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">where threats were required. At the end they had all agreed. . . all but Rast. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You girls do as you please,” Rast said, “but if Thorne sends me against Lady </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Piggy, I’m going to slice me off a rasher of bacon.” He laughed in Jon’s face and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="152" height="22" font="2">left them there. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Hours later, as the castle slept, three of them paid a call on his cell. Grenn held </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his arms while Pyp sat on his legs. Jon could hear Rast’s rapid breathing as Ghost </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leapt onto his chest. The direwolf’s eyes burned red as embers as his teeth nipped </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lightly at the soft skin of the boy’s throat, just enough to draw blood. “Remember, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="422" height="22" font="2">we know where you sleep,” Jon said softly. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The  next morning Jon heard Rast tell Albett and Toad how his razor had </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="242" height="22" font="2">slipped while he shaved. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">From that day forth, neither Rast nor any of the others would hurt Samwell </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tarly. When Ser Alliser matched them against him, they would stand their ground </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and swat  aside his slow, clumsy strokes. If the master-at-arms screamed for an </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">attack, they would dance in and tap Sam lightly on breastplate or helm or leg. Ser </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Alliser raged and threatened and called them all cravens and women and worse, yet </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sam remained unhurt.  A few nights later, at Jon’s urging, he joined them for the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">evening meal, taking a place on the bench beside Halder. It was another fortnight </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">before he found the nerve to join their talk, but in time he was laughing at Pyp’s </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">faces and teasing Grenn with the best of them. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Fat and awkward and frightened he might be, but Samwell Tarly was no fool. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">One night he visited Jon in his cell. “I don’t know what you did,” he said, “but I </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">know you did it.” He looked away shyly. “I’ve never had a friend before.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We’re not friends,” Jon said. He put a hand on Sam’s broad shoulder. “We’re </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">brothers.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And so they were, he thought to himself after Sam had taken his leave. Robb </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Bran and Rickon were his father’s sons, and he loved them still, yet Jon knew </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that he had never truly been one of them. Catelyn Stark had seen to that. The grey </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">walls of Winterfell might still haunt his dreams, but Castle Black was his life now, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and his brothers were Sam and Grenn and Halder and Pyp and the other cast-outs </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">who wore the black of the Night’s Watch. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“My uncle spoke truly,” he whispered to Ghost. He wondered if he would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="389" height="22" font="2">ever see Benjen Stark again, to tell him. </text>

<text top="318" left="195" width="681" height="22" font="2">“The king’s tourney,” Ned corrected, wincing. “I assure you, the </text>

<text top="373" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Call it what you will, my lord. Knights have been arriving from all over the </text>

<text top="483" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">visitors. . . last night we had a drowning, a tavern riot, three knife fights, a rape, two </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fires, robberies beyond count, and a drunken horse race down the Street of the </text>

<text top="593" left="108" width="427" height="22" font="2">“How dreadful,” Varys said with a shudder. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic. “If you cannot keep the king’s </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.” </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Stout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog, his bald pate </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">reddening. “Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">need more men.” </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“How many?” Ned asked, leaning forward. As ever, Robert had not troubled </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="731" height="22" font="2">himself to attend the council session, so it fell to his Hand to speak for him. </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="396" height="22" font="2">“As many as can be gotten, Lord Hand.” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Hire fifty new men,” Ned told him. “Lord Baelish will see that you get the </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">coin.” </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="255" height="22" font="2">“I will?” Littlefinger said. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You will. You found forty thousand golden dragons for a champion’s purse, </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">surely you can scrape together a few coppers to keep the king’s peace.” Ned turned </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">back to Janos Slynt. “I will also give you twenty good swords from my own </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">household guard, to serve with the Watch until the crowds have left.” </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“All thanks, Lord Hand,” Slynt said, bowing. “I promise you, they shall be put </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the council. “The sooner this folly is done with, the better I shall like it.” As if the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">expense and trouble were not irksome enough, all and sundry insisted on salting </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Ned’s wound by calling it “the Hand’s tourney,” as if he were the cause of it. And </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">Robert honestly seemed to think he should feel honored! </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The realm prospers from such events, my lord,” Grand Maester Pycelle said. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="806" height="22" font="2">“They bring the great the chance of glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“And put coins in many a pocket,” Littlefinger added. “Every inn in the city is </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">full, and the whores are walking bowlegged and jingling with each step.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly laughed. “We’re fortunate my brother Stannis is not with us. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Remember the time he proposed to outlaw brothels? The king asked him if perhaps </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he’d like to outlaw eating, shitting, and breathing while he was at it. If truth be told, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">I ofttimes wonder how Stannis ever got that ugly daughter of his. He goes to his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">marriage bed like a man marching to a battlefield, with a grim look in his eyes and a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">determination to do his duty.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned had not joined the laughter. “I wonder about your brother Stannis as well. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">I wonder when he intends to end his visit to Dragonstone and resume his seat on </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">this council.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“No doubt as soon as we’ve scourged all those whores into the sea,” </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger replied, provoking more laughter. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I have heard quite enough about whores for one day,” Ned said, rising. “Until </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">the morrow.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Harwin had the door when Ned returned to the Tower of the Hand. “Summon </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Jory to my chambers and tell your father to saddle my horse,” Ned told him, too </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">brusquely. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="227" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lord.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Red Keep and the “Hand’s tourney” were chafing him raw, Ned reflected </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">as he climbed. He yearned for the comfort of Catelyn’s arms, for the sounds of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Robb and Jon crossing swords in the practice yard, for the cool days and cold nights </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="124" height="22" font="2">of the north. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">In his chambers he stripped off his council silks and sat for a moment with the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">book while he waited for Jory to arrive.  <i>The Lineages and Histories of the Great </i></text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble </i></text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>Ladies and Their Children</i>, by Grand Maester Malleon. Pycelle had spoken truly; it </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">made for ponderous reading. Yet Jon Arryn had asked for it, and Ned felt certain he </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had reasons. There was something here, some truth buried in these brittle yellow </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pages, if only he could see it. But <i>what?</i> The tome was over a century old. Scarcely </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a man now alive had yet been born when Malleon had compiled his dusty lists of </text>

<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He opened to the section on House Lannister once more, and turned the pages </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slowly, hoping against hope that something would leap out at him. The Lannisters </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were an old family, tracing their descent back to Lann the Clever, a trickster from </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Age of Heroes who was no doubt as legendary as Bran the Builder, though far </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">more beloved of singers and taletellers. In the songs, Lann was the fellow who </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">winkled the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock with no weapon but his wits, and stole </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">gold from the sun to brighten his curly hair. Ned wished he were here now, to </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">winkle the truth out of this damnable book. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A sharp rap on the door heralded Jory Cassel. Ned closed Malleon’s tome and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bid him enter. “I’ve promised the City Watch twenty of my guard until the tourney </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is done,” he told him. “I rely on you to make the choice. Give Alyn the command, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and make certain the men understand that they are needed to stop fights, not start </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">them.” Rising, Ned opened a cedar chest and removed a light linen undertunic. “Did </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="2">you find the stableboy?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“The watchman, my lord,” Jory said. “He vows he’ll never touch another </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">horse.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="269" height="22" font="2">“What did he have to say?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He claims he knew Lord Arryn well. Fast friends, they were.” Jory snorted. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“The Hand always gave the lads a copper on their name days, he says. Had a way </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with horses. Never rode his mounts too hard, and brought them carrots and apples, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">so they were always pleased to see him.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Carrots and apples,” Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would be even </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Jory had spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">uninformative, and arrogant as only a new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he would not be questioned </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">by a mere captain of guards. . . even if said captain was ten years older and a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for him, that he was troubled and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">melancholy over his young son’s frailty, and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but he was </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dragonstone, the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The king’s own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy </text>

<text top="1080" left="108" width="483" height="22" font="2">“Did our watchman recall anything else of note?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often went </text>

<page number="220" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="340" height="22" font="2">riding with Lord Stannis, he says.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="4"><i>Stannis again</i>, Ned thought. He found that curious. Jon Arryn and he had been </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cordial, but never friendly. And while Robert had been riding north to Winterfell, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Stannis had removed himself to Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">conquered in his brother’s name. He had given no word as to when he might return. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="466" height="22" font="2">“Where did they go on these rides?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="410" height="22" font="2">“The boy says that they visited a brothel.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A brothel?” Ned said. “The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King visited a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brothel with <i>Stannis Baratheon</i>?” He shook his head, incredulous, wondering what </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly would make of this tidbit. Robert’s lusts were the subject of ribald </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">drinking songs throughout the realm, but Stannis was a different sort of man; a bare </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">year younger than the king, yet utterly unlike  him, stern, humorless, unforgiving, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">grim in his sense of duty. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The boy insists it’s true. The Hand took three guardsmen with him, and the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">boy says they were joking of it when he took their horses afterward.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="288" height="22" font="2">“Which brothel?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="2">“The boy did not know. The guards would.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,” Ned said dryly. “The gods are </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">doing their best to vex us. Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis. . . everyone </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">leagues away.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="573" height="22" font="2">“Will you summon Lord Stannis back from Dragonstone?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Not yet,” Ned said. “Not until I have a better notion of what this is all about </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and where he stands.” The matter nagged at him. Why did Stannis leave? Had he </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">played some part in Jon Arryn’s murder? Or was he afraid? Ned found it hard to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">imagine what could frighten Stannis Baratheon, who had once held Storm’s End </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">through a year of siege, surviving on rats and boot leather while the Lords Tyrell </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="718" height="22" font="2">and Redwyne sat outside with their hosts, banqueting in sight of his walls. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Bring me my doublet, if you would. The grey, with the direwolf sigil. I want </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="690" height="22" font="2">this armorer to know who I am. It might make him more forthcoming.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jory went to the wardrobe. “Lord Renly is brother to Lord Stannis as well as </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">the king.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yet it seems that he was not invited on these rides.” Ned was not sure what </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to make of Renly, with all his friendly ways and easy smiles. A few days past, he </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose gold locklet. Inside was a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">miniature painted in the vivid Myrish style, of a lovely young girl with doe’s eyes </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and a cascade of soft brown hair. Renly had seemed anxious to know if the girl </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">reminded him of anyone, and when Ned had no answer but a shrug, he had seemed </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">disappointed. The maid was Loras Tyrell’s sister Margaery, he’d confessed, but </text>
</page>
<page number="221" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">there were those who said she looked like Lyanna. “No,” Ned had told him, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bemused. Could it be that Lord Renly, who looked so like a young Robert, had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">conceived a passion for a girl he fancied to be a young Lyanna? That struck him as </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="246" height="22" font="2">more than passing queer. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Jory held out the doublet, and Ned slid his hands through the armholes. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps Lord Stannis will return for Robert’s tourney,” he said as Jory laced the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">garment up the back. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="540" height="22" font="2">“That would be a stroke of fortune, my lord,” Jory said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned buckled on a longsword. “In other words, not bloody likely.” His smile </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">was grim. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jory draped Ned’s cloak across his shoulders and clasped it at the throat with </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Hand’s badge of office. “The armorer lives above his shop, in a large house at </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="589" height="22" font="2">the top of the Street of Steel. Alyn knows the way, my lord.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned nodded. “The gods help this potboy if he’s sent me off haring after </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shadows.” It was a slim enough staff to lean on, but the Jon Arryn that Ned Stark </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had known was not one to wear jeweled and silvered plate. Steel was steel; it was </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">meant for protection, not ornament. He might have changed his views, to be sure. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He would scarcely have been the first man who came to look on things differently </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">after a few years at court. . . but the change was marked enough to make Ned </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">wonder. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">“Is there any other service I might perform?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“I suppose you’d best begin visiting whorehouses.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Hard duty, my lord.” Jory grinned. “The men will be glad to help. Porther </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">has made a fair start already.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned’s favorite horse was saddled and waiting in the yard. Varly and Jacks fell </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in beside him as he rode through the yard. Their steel caps and shirts of mail must </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have been sweltering, yet they said no word of complaint. As Lord Eddard passed </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">beneath the King’s Gate into the stink of the city, his grey and white cloak </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">streaming from his shoulders, he saw eyes everywhere and kicked his mount into a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">trot. His guard followed. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He looked behind him frequently as they made their way through the crowded </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">city streets. Tomard and Desmond had left the castle early this morning to take up </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">positions on the route they must take, and watch for anyone following them, but </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">even so, Ned was uncertain. The shadow of the King’s Spider and his little birds </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">had him fretting like a maiden on her wedding night. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Street of Steel began at the market square beside the River Gate, as it was </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">named on maps, or the Mud Gate, as it was commonly called. A mummer on stilts </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was striding through the throngs like some great insect, with a horde of barefoot </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">children trailing behind him, hooting. Elsewhere, two ragged boys no older than </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Bran were dueling with sticks, to the loud encouragement of some and the furious </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">curses of others. An old woman ended the contest by leaning out of her window and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">emptying a bucket of slops on the heads of the combatants. In the shadow of the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wall, farmers stood beside their wagons, bellowing out, “Apples, the best apples, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">cheap at twice the price,” and “Blood melons, sweet as honey,” and “Turnips, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">onions, roots, here you go here, here you go, turnips, onions, roots, here you go </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">here.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The Mud Gate was open, and a squad of City Watchmen stood under the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">portcullis in their golden cloaks, leaning on spears. When a column of riders </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">appeared from the west, the guardsmen sprang into action, shouting commands and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his escort. The </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">first rider through the gate carried a long black banner. The silk rippled in the wind </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">like a living thing; across the fabric was blazoned a night sky slashed with purple </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">lightning. “<i>Make way for Lord Beric!</i>” the rider shouted. “<i>Make way for Lord </i></text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>Beric!</i>” And close behind came the young lord himself, a dashing figure on a black </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">courser, with red-gold hair and a black satin cloak dusted with stars. “Here to fight </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in the Hand’s tourney, my lord?” a guardsman called out to him. “Here to <i>win</i> the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="628" height="22" font="2">Hand’s tourney,” Lord Beric shouted back as the crowd cheered. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned turned off the square where the Street of Steel began and followed  its </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">winding path up a long hill, past blacksmiths working at open forges, freeriders </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">haggling over mail shirts, and grizzled ironmongers selling old blades and razors </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">from their wagons. The farther they climbed, the larger the buildings grew. The </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man they  wanted was all the way at the top of the hill, in a huge house of timber </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and plaster whose upper stories loomed over the narrow street. The double doors </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">showed a hunting scene carved in ebony and weirwood. A pair of stone knights </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stood sentry at the entrance, armored in fanciful suits of polished red steel that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">transformed them into griffin and unicorn. Ned left his horse with Jacks and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">shouldered his way inside. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The slim young serving girl took quick note of Ned’s badge and the sigil on </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his doublet, and the master came hurrying out, all smiles and bows. “Wine for the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">King’s Hand,” he told the girl, gesturing Ned to a couch. “I am Tobho Mott, my </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">lord, please, please, put yourself at ease.” He wore a black velvet coat with </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hammers embroidered on the sleeves in silver thread, Around his neck was a heavy </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">silver chain and a sapphire as large as a pigeon’s egg. “If you are in need of new </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">arms for the Hand’s tourney, you have come to the right shop.” Ned did not bother </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to correct him. “My work is costly, and I make no apologies for that, my lord,” he </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">said as he filled two matching silver goblets. “You will not find craftsmanship equal </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers bought all </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his armor here, Tobho boasted, and many high lords, the ones who knew fine steel, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and even Lord Renly, the king’s own brother. Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Renly’s new armor, the green plate with the golden antlers? No other armorer in the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">city could get that deep a green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">itself, paint and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wanted a blade? Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the forges of Qohor as </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a boy. Only a man who knew the spells could take old weapons and forge them </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">anew. “The direwolf is the sigil of House Stark, is it not? I could fashion a direwolf </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">helm so real that children will run from you in the street,” he vowed. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="582" height="22" font="2">Ned smiled. “Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. “The Hand did call </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">upon me, with Lord Stannis, the king’s brother. I regret to say, they did not honor </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">me with their patronage.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found over the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions. And so it was this time. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They asked to see the boy,” the armorer said, “so I took them back to the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">forge.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The boy,” Ned echoed. He had no notion who the boy might be. “I should </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">like to see the boy as well.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tobho Mott gave him a cool, careful look. “As you wish, my lord,” he said </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with no trace of his former friendliness. He led Ned out a rear door and across a </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">narrow yard, back to the cavernous stone barn where the work was done. When the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">armorer opened the door, the blast of hot air that came through made Ned feel as </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">though he were walking into a dragon’s mouth. Inside, a forge blazed in each </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">corner, and the air stank of smoke and sulfur. Journeymen armorers glanced up </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from their hammers and tongs just long enough to wipe the sweat from their brows, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="544" height="22" font="2">while bare-chested apprentice boys worked the bellows. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The master called over a tall lad about Robb’s age, his arms and chest corded </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with muscle. “This is Lord Stark, the new Hand of the King,” he told him as the boy </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked at Ned through sullen blue eyes and pushed back sweat-soaked hair with his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fingers. Thick hair, shaggy and unkempt and black as ink. The shadow of a new </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beard darkened his jaw. “This is Gendry. Strong for his age, and he works hard. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Show the Hand that helmet you made, lad.” Almost shyly, the boy led them to his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">bench, and a steel helm shaped like a bull’s head, with two great curving horns. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ned turned the helm over in his hands. It was raw steel, unpolished but </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="808" height="22" font="2">expertly shaped. “This is fine work. I would be pleased if you would let me buy it.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="539" height="22" font="2">The boy snatched it out of his hands. “It’s not for sale.” </text>
</page>
<page number="224" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Tobho Mott looked horror-struck. “Boy, this is the King’s Hand. If his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">lordship wants this helm, make him a gift of it. He honors you by asking.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="425" height="22" font="2">“I made it for me,” the boy said stubbornly. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A hundred pardons, my lord,” his master said hurriedly to Ned. “The boy is </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crude as new steel, and like new steel would profit from some beating. That helm is </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">journeyman’s work at best. Forgive him and I promise I will craft you a helm like </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">none you have ever seen.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“He’s done nothing that requires my forgiveness. Gendry, when Lord Arryn </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="420" height="22" font="2">came to see you, what did you talk about?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="383" height="22" font="2">“He asked me questions is all, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="255" height="22" font="2">“What sort of questions?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The boy shrugged. “How was I, and was I well treated, and if I liked the work, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">and stuff about my mother. Who she was and what she looked like and all.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">“What did you tell him?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The boy shoved a fresh fall of black hair off his forehead. “She died when I </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was little. She had yellow hair, and sometimes she used to sing to me, I remember. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="280" height="22" font="2">She worked in an alehouse.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="406" height="22" font="2">“Did Lord Stannis question you as well?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The bald one? No, not him. He never said no word, just glared at me, like I </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="430" height="22" font="2">was some raper who done for his daughter.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Mind your filthy tongue,” the master said. “This is the King’s own Hand.” </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The boy lowered his eyes. “A smart boy, but stubborn. That helm. . .  the others call </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="440" height="22" font="2">him bullheaded, so he threw it in their teeth.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned touched the boy’s head, fingering the thick black hair. “Look at me, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Gendry.” The apprentice lifted his face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">like blue ice. <i>Yes</i>, he thought, <i>I see it</i>. “Go back to your work, lad. I’m sorry to have </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bothered you.” He walked back to the house with the master. “Who paid the boy’s </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">apprentice fee?” he asked lightly. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Mott looked fretful. “You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">those hands were made for hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="52" height="22" font="2">fee.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The truth now,” Ned urged. “The streets are full of strong boys. The day you </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">for him?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A lord,” the master said reluctantly. “He gave no name, and wore no sigil on </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his coat. He paid in gold, twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">the boy, and once for my silence.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="162" height="22" font="2">“Describe him.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there </text>

<page number="225" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was a bit of red in it, I’ll swear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">never did see him clear.” He hesitated a moment. “My lord, I want no trouble.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“None of us wants trouble, but I fear these are troubled times, Master Mott,” </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">Ned said. “You know who the boy is.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="539" height="22" font="2">“I am only an armorer, my lord. I know what I’m told.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="750" height="22" font="2">“You know who the boy is,” Ned repeated patiently. “That is not a question.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“The boy is my apprentice,” the master said. He looked Ned in the eye, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">stubborn as old iron. “Who he was before he came to me, that’s none of my </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">concern.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned nodded. He decided that he liked Tobho Mott, master armorer. “If the day </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ever comes when Gendry would rather wield a sword than forge one, send him to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">me. He has the look of a warrior. Until then, you have my thanks, Master Mott, and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">my promise. Should I ever want a helm to frighten children, this will be the first </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">place I visit.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His guard was waiting outside with the horses. “Did you find anything, my </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">lord?” Jacks asked as Ned mounted up. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I did,” Ned told him, wondering. What had Jon Arryn wanted with a king’s </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">bastard, and why was it worth his life? </text>

<text top="262" left="203" width="671" height="22" font="2">y lady, you ought cover your head,” Ser Rodrik told her as their </text>
<text top="290" left="203" width="443" height="22" font="2">horses plodded north. “You will take a chill.” </text>
<text top="318" left="257" width="615" height="22" font="2">“It is only water, Ser Rodrik,” Catelyn replied. Her hair hung </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wet and heavy, a loose strand stuck to her forehead, and she could imagine how </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ragged and wild she must look, but for once she did not care. The southern rain was </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">soft and warm. Catelyn liked the feel of it on her face, gentle as a mother’s kisses. It </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">took her back to her childhood, to long grey days at Riverrun. She remembered the </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">godswood, drooping branches heavy with moisture, and the sound of her brother’s </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">laughter as he chased her through piles of damp leaves. She remembered making </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">mud pies with Lysa, the weight of them, the mud slick and brown between her </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fingers. They had served them to Littlefinger, giggling, and he’d eaten so much </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="573" height="22" font="2">mud he was sick for a week. How young they all had been. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had almost forgotten. In the north, the rain fell cold and hard, and </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sometimes at night it turned to ice. It was as likely to kill a crop as nurture it, and it </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sent grown men running for the nearest shelter. That was no rain for little girls to </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="78" height="22" font="2">play in. </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I am soaked through,” Ser Rodrik complained. “Even my bones are wet.” </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The woods pressed close around them, and the steady pattering of rain on leaves </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was accompanied by the small sucking sounds their horses made as their hooves </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pulled free of the mud. “We will want a fire tonight, my lady, and a hot meal would </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">serve us both.” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,” Catelyn told him. She had slept </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">been a restless man in his prime, always riding somewhere. She still remembered </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha’s teeth a </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="446" height="22" font="2">dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror. </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“An inn,” Ser Rodrik repeated wistfully. “If only. . . but we dare not risk it. If </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="464" height="22" font="2">Even on the kingsroad, it never hurt to be wary. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They followed the sounds around a lazy bend of the road and saw them; a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">column of armed men noisily fording a swollen stream. Catelyn reined up to let </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them pass. The banner in the hand of the foremost rider hung sodden and limp, but </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the guardsmen wore indigo cloaks and on their shoulders flew the silver eagle of </text>

<text top="308" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Catelyn made no move. Lord Jason Mallister himself rode with them, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">surrounded by his knights, his son Patrek by his side and their squires close behind. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">They were riding for King’s Landing and the Hand’s tourney, she knew. For the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">past week, the travelers had been thick as flies upon the kingsroad; knights and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">freeriders, singers with their harps and drums, heavy wagons laden with hops or </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">corn or casks of honey, traders and craftsmen and whores, and all of them moving </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">south. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She studied Lord Jason boldly. The last time she had seen him he had been </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">jesting with her uncle at her wedding feast; the Mallisters stood bannermen to the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tullys, and his gifts had been lavish. His brown hair was salted with white now, his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">face chiseled gaunt by time, yet the years had not touched his pride. He rode like a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man who feared nothing. Catelyn envied him that; she had come to fear so much. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">As the riders passed, Lord Jason nodded a curt greeting, but it was only a high </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lord’s courtesy to strangers chance met on the road. There was no recognition in </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="543" height="22" font="2">those fierce eyes, and his son did not even waste a look. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="562" height="22" font="2">“He did not know you,” Ser Rodrik said after, wondering. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He saw a  pair of mud-spattered travelers by the side of the road, wet and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tired. It would never occur to him to suspect that one of them was the daughter of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="671" height="22" font="2">his liege lord. I think we shall be safe enough at the inn, Ser Rodrik.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was near dark when they reached  it, at the crossroads north of the great </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">confluence of the Trident. Masha Heddle was fatter and greyer than Catelyn </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remembered, still chewing her sourleaf, but she gave them only the most cursory of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looks, with nary a hint of her ghastly red smile. “Two rooms at the top of the stair, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that’s all there is,” she said, chewing all the while. “They’re under the bell tower, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">you won’t be missing meals, though there’s some thinks it too noisy. Can’t be </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">helped. We’re full up, or near as makes no matter. It’s those rooms or the road.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">It was those rooms, low, dusty garrets at the top of a cramped narrow </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">staircase. “Leave your boots down here,” Masha told them after she’d taken their </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">coin. “The boy will clean them. I won’t have you tracking mud up my stairs. Mind </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the  bell. Those who come late to meals don’t eat.” There were no smiles, and no </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">mention of sweet cakes. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When the supper bell rang, the sound was deafening. Catelyn had changed </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">into dry clothes. She sat by the window, watching rain run down the pane. The glass </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was milky and full of bubbles, and a wet dusk was falling outside. Catelyn could </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">just make out the muddy crossing where the two great roads met. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The crossroads gave her pause. If they turned west from here, it was an easy </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ride down to Riverrun. Her father had always given her wise counsel when she </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">needed it most, and she yearned to talk to him, to warn him of the gathering storm. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">If Winterfell needed to brace for war, how much more so Riverrun, so much closer </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to King’s Landing, with the power of Casterly Rock looming to the west like a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadow. If only her father had been stronger, she might have chanced it, but Hoster </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Tully had been bedridden these past two years, and Catelyn was loath to tax him </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">now. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The eastern road was wilder and more dangerous, climbing through rocky </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">foothills and thick forests into the Mountains of the Moon, past high passes and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">deep chasms to the Vale of Arryn and the stony Fingers beyond. Above the Vale, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Eyrie stood high and impregnable, its towers reaching for the sky. There she </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">would find her sister. . . and, perhaps, some of the answers Ned sought. Surely Lysa </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">knew more than she had dared to put in her letter. She might have the very proof </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that Ned needed to bring the Lannisters to ruin, and if it came to war, they would </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">need the Arryns and the eastern lords who owed them service. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Yet the mountain road was perilous. Shadowcats prowled those passes, rock </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">slides were common, and the mountain clans were lawless brigands, descending </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from the heights to rob and kill and melting away like snow whenever the knights </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">rode out from the Vale in search of them. Even Jon Arryn, as great a lord as any the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Eyrie had ever known, had always traveled in strength when he crossed the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="761" height="22" font="2">mountains. Catelyn’s only strength was one elderly knight, armored in loyalty. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">No, she thought, Riverrun and the Eyrie would have to wait. Her path ran </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">north to Winterfell, where her sons and her duty were waiting for her. As soon as </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">they were safely past the Neck, she could declare herself to one of Ned’s </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">bannermen, and send riders racing ahead with orders to mount a watch on the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">kingsroad. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The rain obscured the fields beyond the crossroads, but Catelyn saw the land </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">clear enough in her memory. The marketplace was just across the way, and the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">village a mile farther on, half a  hundred white cottages surrounding a small stone </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sept. There would be more now; the summer had been long and peaceful. North of </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">here the kingsroad ran along the Green Fork of the Trident, through fertile valleys </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and green woodlands, past thriving towns and stout holdfasts and the castles of the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">river lords. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Catelyn knew them all: the Blackwoods and the Brackens, ever enemies, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whose quarrels her father was obliged to settle; Lady Whent, last of her line, who </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">dwelt with her ghosts in the cavernous vaults of Harrenhal; irascible Lord Frey, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="828" height="22" font="2">who had outlived seven wives and filled his twin castles with children, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, and bastards and grandbastards as well. All </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">of them were bannermen to the Tullys, their swords sworn to the service of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Riverrun. Catelyn wondered if that would be enough, if it came to war. Her father </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was the staunchest man who’d ever lived, and she had no doubt that he would call </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his banners. . . but would the banners come? The Darrys and Rygers and Mootons </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on the Trident, while Lord Frey had arrived with his levies well after the battle was </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">over, leaving some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he had </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her father had called </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him the Late Lord Frey). It must <i>not</i> come to war, Catelyn thought fervently. They </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">must not let it. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik came for her just as the bell ceased its clangor. “We had best make </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="402" height="22" font="2">haste if we hope to eat tonight, my lady.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It might be safer if we were not knight and lady until we pass the Neck,” she </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">told him. “Common travelers attract less notice. A father and daughter taken to the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">road on some family business, say.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lady,” Ser Rodrik agreed. It was only when she laughed that </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he realized what he’d done. “The old courtesies die hard, my—my daughter.” He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">tried to tug on his missing whiskers, and sighed with exasperation. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Catelyn took his arm. “Come, Father,” she said. “You’ll find  that Masha </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Heddle sets a good table, I think, but try not to praise her. You truly don’t want to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">see her smile.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The common room was long and drafty, with a row of huge wooden kegs at </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">one end and a fireplace at the other. A serving boy ran back and forth with skewers </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="791" height="22" font="2">of meat while Masha drew beer from the kegs, chewing her sourleaf all the while. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The benches were crowded, townsfolk and farmers mingling freely with all </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">manner of travelers. The crossroads made for odd companions; dyers with black </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and purple hands shared a bench with rivermen reeking of fish, an ironsmith thick </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with muscle squeezed in beside a wizened old septon, hard-bitten sellswords and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">soft plump merchants swapped news like boon companions. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The company included more swords than Catelyn would have liked. Three by </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the fire wore the red stallion badge of the Brackens, and there was a large party in </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">blue steel ringmail and capes of a silvery grey. On their shoulder was another </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">familiar sigil, the twin towers of House Frey. She studied their faces, but they were </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all too young to have known her. The senior among them would have been no older </text>

<page number="230" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">than Bran when she went north. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik found them an empty place on the bench near the kitchen. Across </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the table a handsome youth was fingering a woodharp.  “Seven blessings to you, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="782" height="22" font="2">goodfolk,” he said as they sat. An empty wine cup stood on the table before him. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And to you, singer,” Catelyn returned. Ser Rodrik called for bread and meat </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and beer in a tone that meant <i>now</i>. The singer, a youth of some eighteen years, eyed </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them boldly and asked where they were going, and from whence they had come, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and what news they had, letting the questions fly as quick as arrows and never </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pausing for an answer. “We left King’s Landing a fortnight ago,” Catelyn replied, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">answering the safest of his questions. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That’s where I’m bound,” the youth said. As she had suspected, he was more </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">interested in telling his own story than in hearing theirs. Singers loved nothing half </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">so well as the sound of  their own voices. “The Hand’s tourney means rich lords </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with fat purses. The last time I came away with more silver than I could carry. . . or </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">would have, if I hadn’t lost it all betting on the Kingslayer to win the day.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The gods frown on the gambler,” Ser  Rodrik said sternly. He was of the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="486" height="22" font="2">north, and shared the Stark views on tournaments. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“They frowned on me, for certain,” the singer said. “Your cruel gods and the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">Knight of Flowers altogether did me in.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">“No doubt that was a lesson for you,” Ser Rodrik said. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="521" height="22" font="2">“It was. This time my coin will champion Ser Loras.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik tried to tug at whiskers that were not there, but before he could </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">frame a rebuke the serving boy came scurrying up. He laid trenchers of bread before </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them and filled them with chunks of browned meat off a skewer, dripping with hot </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">juice. Another skewer held tiny onions, fire peppers, and fat mushrooms. Ser </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">Rodrik set to lustily as the lad ran back to fetch them beer. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My name is Marillion,” the singer said, plucking a string on his woodharp. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="464" height="22" font="2">“Doubtless you’ve heard me play somewhere?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His manner made Catelyn smile. Few wandering singers ever ventured as far </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">north as Winterfell, but she knew his like from her girlhood in Riverrun. “I fear </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="184" height="22" font="2">not,” she told him. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He drew a plaintive chord from the woodharp. “That is your loss,” he said. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="466" height="22" font="2">“Who was the finest singer you’ve ever heard?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="473" height="22" font="2">“Alia of Braavos,” Ser Rodrik answered at once. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I’m  <i>much</i>  better than that old stick,” Marillion said. “If you have the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="384" height="22" font="2">silver for a song, I’ll gladly show you.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I might have a copper or two, but I’d sooner toss it down a well than pay for </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">your howling,” Ser Rodrik groused. His opinion of singers was well known; music </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was a lovely thing for girls, but he could not comprehend why any healthy boy </text>

<page number="231" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="629" height="22" font="2">would fill his hand with a harp when he might have had a sword. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Your grandfather has a sour nature,” Marillion said to Catelyn. “I meant to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">do you honor. An homage to your beauty. In truth, I was made to sing for kings and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">high lords.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I can see that,” Catelyn said. “Lord  Tully is fond of song, I hear. No </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">doubt you’ve been to Riverrun.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A hundred times,” the singer said airily. “They keep a chamber for me, and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">the young lord is like a brother.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn smiled, wondering what Edmure would think of that. Another singer </text>

<text top="335" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">Winterfell?” she asked him. “Have you traveled north?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Why would I?’ Marillion asked. “It’s all blizzards and bearskins up there, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and the Starks know no music but the howling of wolves.” Distantly, she was aware </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="503" height="22" font="2">of the door banging open at the far end of the room. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Innkeep,” a servant’s voice called out behind her, “we have horses that want </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">stabling, and my lord of Lannister requires a room and a hot bath.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Oh, gods,” Ser Rodrik said before Catelyn reached out to silence him, her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">fingers tightening hard around his forearm. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Masha Heddle was bowing and smiling her hideous red smile. “I’m sorry, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">m’lord, truly, we’re full up, every room.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">There were four of them, Catelyn saw. An old man in the black of the Night’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Watch, two servants. . . and him, standing there small and bold as life. “My men </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">will steep in your stable, and as for myself, well, I do not require a <i>large</i> room, as </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you can plainly see.” He flashed a mocking grin. “So long as the fire’s warm and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="524" height="22" font="2">the straw reasonably free of fleas, I am a happy man.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Masha Heddle was beside herself. “M’lord, there’s nothing, it’s the tourney, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">there’s no help for it, oh. . .” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister pulled a coin from his purse and flicked it up over his head, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">caught it, tossed it again. Even across the room, where Catelyn sat, the wink of gold </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">was unmistakable. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A freerider in a faded blue cloak lurched to his feet. “You’re welcome to my </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">room, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Now there’s a clever man,” Lannister said as he sent the coin spinning across </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the room. The freerider snatched it from the air. “And a nimble one to boot.” The </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">dwarf turned back to Masha Heddle. “You will be able to manage food, I trust?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Anything you like, m’lord, anything at all,” the innkeep promised. <i>And may </i></text>

<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lannister glanced at the nearest tables. “My men will have whatever you’re </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">“Aye, m’lord, I will,” the black brother replied. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The dwarf had not so much as glanced toward the far end of the room, and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Catelyn was thinking how grateful she was for the crowded benches between them </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when suddenly Marillion bounded to his feet. “<i>My lord of Lannister!</i>” he called out. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“I would be pleased to entertain you while you eat. Let me sing you the lay of your </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">father’s great victory at King’s Landing!” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Nothing would be more likely to ruin my supper,” the dwarf said dryly. His </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mismatched eyes considered the singer briefly, started to move away. . . and found </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Catelyn. He looked at her for a moment, puzzled. She turned her face away, but too </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">late. The dwarf was smiling. “Lady Stark, what an unexpected pleasure,” he said. “I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="360" height="22" font="2">was sorry to miss you at Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Marillion gaped at her, confusion giving way to chagrin as Catelyn rose </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slowly to her feet. She heard Ser Rodrik curse. If only the man had lingered at the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">Wall, she thought, if only. . .  </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="442" height="22" font="2">“Lady. . . Stark?” Masha Heddle said thickly. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I bedded here,” she told the innkeep. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ears. “You in the corner,” she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="727" height="22" font="2">“Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="394" height="22" font="2">The man got to his feet. “It is, my lady.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father, Lord Hoster Tully </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">of Riverrun?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="324" height="22" font="2">“She is,” the man replied stoutly. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik rose quietly and loosened his sword in its scabbard. The dwarf was </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="695" height="22" font="2">blinking at them, blank-faced, with puzzlement in his mismatched eyes. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The red stallion was ever a welcome sight in Riverrun,” she said to the trio </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">by the fire. “My father counts Jonos Bracken among his oldest and most loyal </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">bannermen.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The three men-at-arms exchanged uncertain looks. “Our lord is honored by his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="336" height="22" font="2">trust,” one of them said hesitantly. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I envy your father all these fine friends,” Lannister quipped, “but I do not </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="409" height="22" font="2">quite see the purpose of this, Lady Stark.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She ignored him, turning to the large party in blue and grey. They were the </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">heart of the matter; there were more than twenty of them. “I know your sigil as </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">well: the twin towers of Frey. How fares your good lord, sers?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Their captain rose. “Lord Walder is well, my lady. He plans to take a new </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wife on his ninetieth name day, and has asked your lord father to honor the wedding </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">with his presence.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister sniggered. That was when Catelyn knew he was hers. “This </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man came a guest into my house, and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">seven,” she proclaimed to the room at large, pointing. Ser Rodrik moved to her side, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his sword in hand. “In the name of King Robert and the good lords you serve, I call </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king’s </text>

<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She did not know what was more satisfying: the sound of a dozen swords </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="510" height="22" font="2">drawn as one or the look on Tyrion Lannister’s face. </text>

<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beautifully that day, in a green gown that brought out the auburn of her hair, and </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">she knew they were looking at her and smiling. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They watched the heroes of a hundred songs ride forth, each more fabulous </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet from where Sansa was seated. The point of Ser Gregor’s lance had snapped off </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in his neck, and his life’s blood flowed out in slow pulses, each weaker than the one </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">before. His armor was shiny new; a bright streak of fire ran down his outstretched </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">arm, as the steel caught the light. Then the sun went behind a cloud, and it was </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gone. His cloak was blue, the color of the sky on a clear summer’s day, trimmed </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with a border of crescent moons, but as his blood seeped into it, the cloth darkened </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">and the moons turned red, one by one. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jeyne Poole wept so hysterically that Septa Mordane finally took her off to </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">regain her composure, but Sansa sat with her hands folded in her lap, watching with </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a strange fascination. She had never seen a man die before. She ought to be crying </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">too, she thought, but the tears would not come. Perhaps she had used up all her tears </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for Lady and Bran. It would be different if it had been Jory or Ser Rodrik or Father, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">she told herself. The young knight in the blue cloak was nothing to her, some </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stranger from the Vale of Arryn whose name she had forgotten as soon as she heard </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it. And now the world would forget his name too, Sansa realized; there would be no </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="333" height="22" font="2">songs sung for him. That was sad. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">After they carried off the body, a boy with a spade ran onto the field and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shoveled  dirt over the spot where he had fallen, to cover up the blood. Then the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">jousts resumed. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Balon Swann also fell to Gregor, and Lord Renly to the Hound. Renly was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">unhorsed so violently that he seemed to fly backward off his charger, legs in the air. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">His head hit the ground with an audible crack that made the crowd gasp, but it was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">just the golden antler on his helm. One of the tines had snapped off beneath him. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">When Lord Renly climbed to his feet, the commons cheered wildly, for King </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert’s handsome young brother was a great favorite. He handed the broken tine </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to his conqueror with a gracious bow. The Hound snorted and tossed the broken </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">antler into the crowd, where the commons began to punch and claw over the little </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bit of gold, until Lord Renly walked out among them and restored the peace. By </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">then Septa Mordane had returned, alone. Jeyne had been feeling ill, she explained; </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="756" height="22" font="2">she had helped her back to the castle. Sansa had almost forgotten about Jeyne. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Later a hedge knight in a checkered cloak disgraced himself by killing Beric </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dondarrion’s horse, and was declared forfeit. Lord Beric shifted his saddle to a new </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mount, only to be knocked right off it by Thoros of Myr. Ser Aron Santagar and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Lothor Brune tilted thrice without result; Ser Aron fell afterward to  Lord Jason </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="573" height="22" font="2">Mallister, and Brune to Yohn Royce’s younger son, Robar. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">In the end it came down to four; the Hound and his monstrous brother Gregor, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the youth they called the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="188" height="22" font="2">Knight of Flowers. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Loras was the youngest son of Mace Tyrell, the Lord of Highgarden and </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Warden of the South. At sixteen, he was the youngest rider on the field, yet he had </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">unhorsed three knights of the Kingsguard that morning in his first three jousts. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa had never seen anyone so beautiful. His plate was intricately fashioned and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">enameled as a bouquet of a thousand different flowers, and his snow-white stallion </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was draped in a blanket of red and white roses. After each victory, Ser Loras would </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remove his helm and ride slowly round the fence, and finally pluck a single white </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">rose from the blanket and toss it to some fair maiden in the crowd. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">His last match of the day was against the younger Royce. Ser Robar’s </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ancestral runes proved small protection as Ser Loras split his shield and drove him </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from his saddle to crash with an awful clangor in the dirt. Robar lay moaning as the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">victor made his circuit of the field. Finally they called for a litter and carried him off </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to his tent, dazed and unmoving. Sansa never saw it. Her eyes were only for Ser </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Loras. When the white horse stopped in front of her, she thought her heart would </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">burst. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">To the other maidens he had given white roses, but the one he plucked for her </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was red. “Sweet lady,” he said, “no victory is half so beautiful as you.” Sansa took </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the flower timidly, struck dumb by his gallantry. His hair was a mass of lazy brown </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">curls, his eyes like liquid gold. She inhaled the sweet fragrance of the rose and sat </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">clutching it long after Ser Loras had ridden off. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When Sansa finally looked up, a man was standing over her, staring. He was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">short, with a pointed beard and a silver streak in his hair, almost as old as her father. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“You must be one of her daughters,” he said to her. He had grey-green eyes that did </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="565" height="22" font="2">not smile when his mouth did. “You have the Tully look.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I’m Sansa Stark,” she said, ill at ease. The man wore a heavy cloak with a fur </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">collar, fastened with a silver mockingbird, and he had the effortless manner of a </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="711" height="22" font="2">high lord, but she did not know him. “I have not had the honor, my lord.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane quickly took a hand. “Sweet child, this is Lord Petyr Baelish, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">of the king’s small council.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your mother was <i>my</i> queen of beauty once,” the man said quietly. His breath </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smelled of mint. “You have her hair.” His fingers brushed against her cheek as he </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="663" height="22" font="2">stroked one auburn lock. Quite abruptly he turned and walked away. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By then, the moon was well up and the crowd was tired, so the king decreed </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that the last three matches would be fought the next morning, before the melee. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">While the commons began their walk home, talking of the day’s jousts and the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">matches to come on the morrow, the court moved to the riverside to begin the feast. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Six monstrous huge aurochs had been roasting for hours, turning slowly on wooden </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spits while kitchen boys basted them with butter and herbs until the meat crackled </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and spit. Tables and benches had been raised outside the pavilions, piled high with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">sweetgrass and strawberries and fresh-baked bread. </text>
</page>
<page number="238" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa and Septa Mordane were given places of high honor, to the left of the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raised dais where the king himself sat beside his queen. When Prince Joffrey seated </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">himself to her right, she felt her throat tighten. He had not spoken a word to her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">since the awful thing had happened, and she had not dared to speak to him. At first </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she thought she hated him for what they’d done to Lady, but after Sansa had wept </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her eyes dry, she told herself that it had not been Joffrey’s doing, not truly. The </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">queen had done it; she was the one to hate, her and Arya. Nothing bad would have </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="260" height="22" font="2">happened except for Arya. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She could not hate Joffrey tonight. He was too beautiful to hate. He wore a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">deep blue doublet studded with a double row of golden lion’s heads, and around his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brow a slim coronet made of gold and sapphires. His hair was as bright as the metal. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Sansa looked at him and trembled, afraid that he might ignore her or, worse, turn </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="492" height="22" font="2">hateful again and send her weeping from the table. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Instead Joffrey smiled and kissed her hand, handsome and gallant as any </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="773" height="22" font="2">prince in the songs, and said, “Ser Loras has a keen eye for beauty, sweet lady.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He was too kind,” she demurred, trying to remain modest and calm, though </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">her heart was singing. “Ser Loras is a true knight. Do you think he will win </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">tomorrow, my lord?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No,” Joffrey said. “My dog will do for him, or perhaps my uncle Jaime. And </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in a few years, when I am old enough to enter the lists, I shall do for them all.” He </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raised his hand to summon a servant with a flagon of iced summerwine, and poured </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her a cup. She looked anxiously at Septa Mordane, until Joffrey leaned over and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">filled the septa’s cup as well, so she nodded and thanked him graciously and said </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="176" height="22" font="2">not another word. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The servants kept the cups filled all night, yet afterward Sansa could not recall </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ever tasting the wine. She needed no wine. She was drunk on the magic of the night, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">giddy with glamour, swept away by beauties she had dreamt of all her life and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">never dared hope to know. Singers sat before the king’s pavilion, filling the dusk </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with music. A juggler kept a cascade of burning clubs spinning through the air. The </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">king’s own fool, the pie-faced simpleton called Moon Boy, danced about on stilts, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all in motley, making mock of everyone with such deft cruelty that Sansa wondered </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">if he was simple after all. Even Septa Mordane was helpless before him; when he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sang his little song about the High Septon, she laughed so hard she spilled wine on </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">herself. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And Joffrey was the soul of courtesy. He talked to Sansa all night, showering </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">her with compliments, making her laugh, sharing little bits of court gossip, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">explaining Moon Boy’s japes. Sansa was so captivated that she quite forgot all her </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="551" height="22" font="2">courtesies and ignored Septa Mordane, seated to her left. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">All the while the courses came and went. A thick soup of barley and venison. </text>
</page>
<page number="239" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Salads of sweetgrass and spinach and plums, sprinkled with crushed nuts. Snails in </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">honey and garlic. Sansa had never eaten snails before; Joffrey showed her how to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">get the snail out of the shell, and fed her the first sweet morsel himself. Then came </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">trout fresh from the river, baked in clay; her prince helped her crack open the hard </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">casing to expose the flaky white flesh within. And when the meat course was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brought out, he served her himself, slicing a queen’s portion from the joint, smiling </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as he laid it on her plate. She could see from the way he moved that his right arm </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="608" height="22" font="2">was still troubling him, yet he uttered not a word of complaint. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Later came sweetbreads and pigeon pie and baked apples fragrant with </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cinnamon and lemon cakes frosted in sugar, but by then Sansa was so stuffed that </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she could not manage more than two little lemon cakes, as much as she loved them. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">She was wondering whether she might attempt a third when the king began to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">shout. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">King Robert had grown louder with each course. From time to time Sansa </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could hear him laughing or roaring a command over the music and the clangor of </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="738" height="22" font="2">plates and cutlery, but they were too far away for her to make out his words. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Now everybody heard him. “<i>No</i>,” he thundered in a voice that drowned out all </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">other speech. Sansa was shocked to see the king on his feet, red of face, reeling. He </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had a goblet of wine in one hand, and he was drunk as a man could be. “You do not </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tell me what to do, woman,” he screamed at Queen Cersei. “I am king here, do you </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">understand? I rule here, and if I say that I will fight tomorrow, <i>I will fight!</i>” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Everyone was staring. Sansa saw Ser Barristan, and the king’s brother Renly, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the short man who had talked to her so oddly and touched her hair, but no one </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">made a move to interfere. The queen’s face was a mask, so bloodless that it might </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have been sculpted from snow. She rose from the table, gathered her skirts around </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">her, and stormed off in silence, servants trailing behind. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister put a hand on the king’s shoulder, but the king shoved him </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">away hard. Lannister stumbled and fell. The king guffawed. “The great knight. I can </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">still knock you in the dirt. Remember that, Kingslayer.” He slapped his chest with </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the jeweled goblet, splashing wine all over his satin tunic. “Give me my hammer </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="479" height="22" font="2">and not a man in the realm can stand before me!” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister rose and brushed himself off. “As you say, Your Grace.” His </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="152" height="22" font="2">voice was stiff. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly came forward, smiling. “You’ve spilled your wine, Robert. Let </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">me bring you a fresh goblet.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa started as Joffrey laid his hand on her arm. “It grows late,” the prince </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said. He had a queer look on his face, as if he were not seeing her at all. “Do you </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="336" height="22" font="2">need an escort back to the castle?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No,” Sansa began. She looked for Septa Mordane, and was startled to find </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">her with her head on the table, snoring soft and  ladylike snores. “I mean to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">say. . . yes, thank you, that would be most kind. I am tired, and the way is so dark. I </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">should be glad for some protection.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="257" height="22" font="2">Joffrey called out, “<i>Dog!</i>” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane seemed to take form out of the night, so quickly did he </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">appear. He had exchanged his armor for a red woolen tunic with a leather dog’s </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">head sewn on the front. The light of the torches made his burned face shine a dull </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">red. “Yes, Your Grace?” he said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Take my betrothed back to the castle, and see that no harm befalls her,” the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">prince told him brusquely. And without even a word of farewell, Joffrey strode off, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">leaving her there. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa could  <i>feel</i>  the Hound watching her. “Did you think Joff was going to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">take you himself?” He laughed. He had a laugh like the snarling of dogs in a pit. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Small chance of that.” He pulled her unresisting to her feet. “Come, you’re not the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">only one needs sleep. I’ve drunk too much, and I may need to kill my brother </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="297" height="22" font="2">tomorrow.” He laughed again. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Suddenly terrified, Sansa pushed at Septa Mordane’s  shoulder, hoping to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wake her, but she only snored the louder. King Robert had stumbled off and half the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">benches were suddenly empty. The feast was over, and the beautiful dream had </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">ended with it. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Hound snatched up a torch to light their way. Sansa followed close beside </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him. The ground was rocky and uneven; the flickering light made it seem to shift </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and move beneath her. She kept her eyes lowered, watching where she placed her </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">feet. They walked among the pavilions, each with its banner and its armor hung </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">outside, the silence weighing heavier with every step. Sansa could not bear the sight </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of him, he frightened her so, yet she had been raised in all the ways of courtesy. A </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">true lady would not notice his face, she told herself. “You rode gallantly today, Ser </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">Sandor,” she made herself say. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane snarled at her. “Spare me your empty little compliments, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">girl. . . and your <i>ser</i>’s. I am no knight. I spit on them and their vows. My brother is </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="378" height="22" font="2">a knight. Did you see him ride today?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="473" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Sansa whispered, trembling. “He was. . .  </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="305" height="22" font="2">“Gallant?” the Hound finished. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">He was mocking her, she realized. “No one could withstand him,” she </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">managed at last, proud of herself. It was no lie. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane stopped suddenly in the middle of a dark and empty field. She </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had no choice but to stop beside him. “Some septa trained you well. You’re like one </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">of those birds from the Summer Isles, aren’t you? A pretty little talking bird, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="593" height="22" font="2">repeating all the pretty little words they taught you to recite.” </text>

<page number="241" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That’s unkind.” Sansa could feel  her heart fluttering in her chest. “You’re </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">frightening me. I want to go now.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>No one could withstand him</i>,” the Hound rasped. “That’s truth enough. No </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one could ever withstand Gregor. That boy today, his second joust, oh, that was a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pretty bit of business. You saw that, did you? Fool boy, he had no business riding in </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">this company. No money, no squire, no one to help him with that armor. That </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gorget wasn’t fastened proper. You think Gregor didn’t notice that? You think Ser </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Gregor’s lance rode up by chance, do you? Pretty little talking girl, you believe that, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you’re empty-headed as a bird for true. Gregor’s lance goes where Gregor wants it </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to go. Look at me. <i>Look at me!</i>” Sandor Clegane put a huge hand under her chin and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forced her face up. He squatted in front of her, and moved the torch close. “There’s </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a pretty for you. Take a good long stare. You know you want to. I’ve watched you </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">turning away all the way down the kingsroad. Piss on that. Take your look.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">His fingers held her jaw as hard as an iron trap. His eyes watched hers. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="484" height="22" font="2">Drunken eyes, sullen with anger. She had to look. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The right side of his face was gaunt, with sharp cheekbones and a grey eye </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beneath a heavy brow. His nose was large and hooked, his hair thin, dark. He wore </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="806" height="22" font="2">it long and brushed it sideways, because no hair grew on the <i>other</i> side of that face. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The left side of his face was a ruin. His ear had been burned away; there was </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nothing left but a hole. His eye was still good, but all around it was a twisted mass </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of scar, slick black flesh hard as leather, pocked with craters and fissured by deep </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cracks that gleamed red and wet when he moved. Down by his jaw, you could see a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">hint of bone where the flesh had been seared away. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa began to cry. He let go of her then, and snuffed out the torch in the dirt. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“No pretty words for that, girl? No little compliment the septa taught you?” When </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there was no answer, he continued. “Most of them, they think it was some battle. A </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">siege, a burning tower, an enemy with a torch. One fool asked if it was </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dragonsbreath.” His laugh was softer this time, but just as bitter. “I’ll tell you what </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it was, girl,” he said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">could smell the sour stench of wine on his breath. “I was younger than you, six, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under my father’s keep, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don’t remember </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">what I got, but it was Gregor’s gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">joint pegged separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">five years older than me, the toy was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his knight, but there was no joy to it, I </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me. There was a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shoved the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I </text>
</page>
<page number="242" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">screamed and screamed. You saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">men to drag him off me. The septons preach about the seven hells. What do they </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="661" height="22" font="2">know? Only a man who’s been burned knows what hell is truly like. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My father told everyone my bedding had caught fire, and our maester gave </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">me ointments.  <i>Ointments!</i>  Gregor got his ointments too. Four years later, they </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">anointed him with the seven oils and he recited his knightly vows and Rhaegar </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">Targaryen tapped him on the shoulder and said, ‘Arise, Ser Gregor.’” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The rasping voice trailed off. He squatted silently before her, a hulking black </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shape shrouded in the night, hidden from her eyes. Sansa could hear his ragged </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">breathing. She was sad for him, she realized. Somehow, the fear had gone away. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The silence went on and on, so long that she began to grow afraid once more, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but she was afraid for him now, not for herself. She found his massive shoulder </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="606" height="22" font="2">with her hand. “He was no true knight,” she whispered to him. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Hound threw back his head and roared. Sansa stumbled back, away from </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him, but he caught her arm. “No,” he growled at her, “no, little bird, he was no true </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">knight.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The rest of the way into the city, Sandor Clegane said not a word. He led her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to where the carts were waiting, told a driver to take them back to the Red Keep, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and climbed in after her. They rode in silence through the King’s Gate and up </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">torchlit city streets. He opened the postern door and led her into the castle, his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">burned face twitching and his eyes brooding, and he was one step behind her as </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">they climbed the tower stairs. He took her safe all the way to the corridor outside </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="166" height="22" font="2">her bedchamber. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="413" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, my lord,” Sansa said meekly. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Hound caught her by the arm and leaned close. “The things I told you </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">tonight,” he said, his voice sounding even rougher than usual. “If you ever tell </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">Joffrey. . . your sister, your father. . . any of them. . .” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="401" height="22" font="2">“I won’t,” Sansa whispered. “I promise.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="694" height="22" font="2">It was not enough. “If you ever tell <i>anyone</i>,” he finished, “I’ll kill you.” </text>

<text top="290" left="141" width="730" height="22" font="2">down at the body in the back of the cart. “He had no one else. A mother in </text>
<text top="318" left="141" width="202" height="22" font="2">the Vale, I am told.” </text>
<text top="345" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">In the pale dawn light, the young knight looked as though he were sleeping. </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He had not been handsome, but death had smoothed his rough-hewn features and </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the silent sisters had dressed him in his best velvet tunic, with a high collar to cover </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the ruin the lance had made of his throat. Eddard Stark looked at his face, and </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wondered if it had been for his sake that the boy had died. Slain by a Lannister </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bannerman before Ned could speak to him; could that be mere happenstance? He </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="314" height="22" font="2">supposed he would never know. </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Hugh was Jon Arryn’s squire for four years,” Selmy went on. “The king </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knighted him before he rode north, in Jon’s memory. The lad wanted it desperately, </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="277" height="22" font="2">yet I fear he was not ready.” </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned had slept badly last night and he felt tired beyond his years. “None of us </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">is ever ready,” he said. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="187" height="22" font="2">“For knighthood?” </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“For death.” Gently Ned covered the boy with his cloak, a bloodstained bit of </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blue bordered in crescent moons. When his mother asked why her son was dead, he </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">reflected bitterly, they would tell her he had fought to honor the King’s Hand, </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark. “This was needless. War should not be a game.” Ned turned to the </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">woman beside the cart, shrouded in grey, face hidden but for her eyes. The silent </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sisters prepared men for the grave, and it was ill fortune to look on the face of </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">death. “Send his armor home to the Vale. The mother will want to have it.” </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It is worth a fair piece of silver,” Ser Barristan said. “The boy had it forged </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">special for the tourney. Plain work, but good. I do not know if he had finished </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">paying the smith.” </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He paid yesterday, my lord, and he paid dearly,” Ned replied. And to the </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">silent sister he said, “Send the mother the armor. I will deal with this smith.” She </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="164" height="22" font="2">bowed her head. </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Afterward Ser Barristan walked with Ned to the king’s pavilion. The camp </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was beginning to stir. Fat sausages sizzled and spit over firepits, spicing the air with </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the scents of garlic and pepper. Young squires hurried about on errands as their </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">masters woke, yawning and stretching, to meet the day. A serving man with a goose </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">under his arm bent his knee when he caught sight of them. “M’lords,” he muttered </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as the goose honked and pecked at his fingers. The shields displayed outside each </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">tent heralded its occupant: the silver eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron’s field of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">nightingales, a cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">the dawn. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The king means to fight in the melee today,” Ser Barristan said as they were </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">passing Ser Meryn’s shield, its paint sullied by a deep gash where Loras Tyrell’s </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Ned said grimly. Jory had woken him last night to bring him that news. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">Small wonder he had slept so badly. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan’s look was troubled. “They say night’s beauties fade at dawn, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="619" height="22" font="2">and the children of wine are oft disowned in the morning light.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“They say so,” Ned agreed, “but not of Robert.” Other men might reconsider </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">words spoken in drunken bravado, but Robert Baratheon would remember and, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">remembering, would never back down. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The king’s pavilion was close by the water, and the morning mists off the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">river had wreathed it in wisps of grey. It was all of golden silk, the largest and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">grandest structure in the camp. Outside the entrance, Robert’s warhammer was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">displayed beside an immense iron shield blazoned with the crowned stag of House </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">Baratheon. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned had hoped to discover the king still abed in a wine-soaked sleep, but luck </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was not with him. They found Robert drinking beer from a polished horn and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">roaring his displeasure at two young squires who were trying to buckle him into his </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">armor. “Your Grace,” one was saying, almost in tears, “it’s made too small, it won’t </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">go.” He fumbled, and the gorget he was trying to fit around Robert’s thick neck </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">tumbled to the ground. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Seven hells!</i>” Robert swore. “Do I have to do it myself? Piss on the both of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you. Pick it up. Don’t just stand there gaping, Lancel, <i>pick it up!</i>” The lad jumped, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and the king noticed his company. “Look at these oafs, Ned. My wife insisted I take </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">these two to squire for me, and they’re worse than useless. Can’t even put a man’s </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">armor on him properly. Squires, they say.  <i>I</i>  say they’re swineherds dressed up in </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">silk.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned only needed a glance to understand the difficulty. “The boys are not at </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="622" height="22" font="2">fault,” he told the king. “You’re too fat for your armor, Robert.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert Baratheon took a long swallow of beer, tossed the empty horn onto his </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sleeping furs, wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, and said darkly, “Fat? </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>Fat</i>, is it? Is that how you speak to your king?” He let go his laughter, sudden as a </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="548" height="22" font="2">storm. “Ah, damn you, Ned, why are you always right?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The squires smiled nervously until the king turned on them. “You. Yes, both </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of you. You heard the Hand. The king is too fat for his armor. Go find Ser Aron </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Santagar. Tell him I need the breastplate stretcher.  <i>Now! What are you waiting </i></text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="4"><i>for?</i>” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The boys tripped over each other in their haste to be quit of the tent. Robert </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">managed to keep a stern face until they were gone. Then he dropped back into a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="280" height="22" font="2">chair, shaking with laughter. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan Selmy chuckled with him. Even Eddard Stark managed a smile. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Always, though, the graver thoughts crept in. He could not help taking note of the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">two squires: handsome boys, fair and well made.  One was Sansa’s age, with long </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">golden curls; the other perhaps fifteen, sandy-haired, with a wisp of a mustache and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">the emerald-green eyes of the queen. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ah, I wish I could be there to see Santagar’s face,” Robert said. “I hope he’ll </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">have the wit to send them to someone else. We ought to keep them running all </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">day!” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="437" height="22" font="2">“Those boys,” Ned asked him. “Lannisters?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert nodded, wiping tears from his eyes. “Cousins. Sons of Lord Tywin’s </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother. One of the dead ones. Or perhaps the live one, now that I come to think on </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="626" height="22" font="2">it. I don’t recall. My wife comes from a very large family, Ned.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>A very ambitious family</i>, Ned thought. He had nothing against the squires, but </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it troubled him to see Robert surrounded by the queen’s kin, waking and sleeping. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The Lannister appetite for offices and honors seemed to know no bounds. “The talk </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">is you and the queen had angry words last night.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The mirth curdled on Robert’s face. “The woman tried to forbid me to fight in </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the melee. She’s sulking in the castle now, damn her. Your sister would never have </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">shamed me like that.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You never knew Lyanna as I did, Robert,” Ned told him. “You saw her </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">beauty, but not the iron underneath. She would have told you that you have no </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">business in the melee.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You too?” The king frowned. “You are a sour man,  Stark. Too long in the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">north, all the juices have frozen inside you. Well,  <i>mine</i>  are still running.” He </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">slapped his chest to prove it. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="386" height="22" font="2">“You are the king,” Ned reminded him. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I sit on the damn iron seat when I must. Does that mean I don’t have the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">same hungers as other men? A bit of wine now and again, a girl squealing in bed, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="760" height="22" font="2">the feel of a horse between my legs? Seven hells, Ned, I want to <i>hit</i> someone.” </text>
</page>
<page number="246" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan Selmy spoke up. “Your Grace,” he said, “it is not seemly that </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the king should ride into the melee. It would not be a fair contest. Who would dare </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="123" height="22" font="2">strike you?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert seemed honestly taken aback. “Why, all of them, damn it. If they can. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">And the last man left standing. . .” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“. . . will be you,” Ned finished. He saw at once that Selmy had hit the mark. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">The dangers of the melee were only a savor to Robert, but this touched on his pride. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Ser Barristan is right. There’s not a man in the Seven Kingdoms who would dare </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">risk your displeasure by hurting you.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The king rose to his feet, his face flushed. “Are you telling me those prancing </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="248" height="22" font="2">cravens will <i>let me win</i>?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“For a certainty,” Ned said, and Ser Barristan Selmy bowed his head in silent </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">accord. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">For a moment Robert was so angry he could not speak. He strode across the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tent, whirled, strode back, his face dark and angry. He snatched up his breastplate </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from the ground and threw it at Barristan Selmy in a wordless fury. Selmy dodged. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">“Get out,” the king said then, coldly. “Get out before I kill you.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan left quickly. Ned was about to follow when the king called out </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">again. “Not you, Ned.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned turned back. Robert took up his horn again, filled it with beer from a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">barrel in the corner, and thrust it at Ned. “Drink,” he said brusquely. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="175" height="22" font="2">“I’ve no thirst—” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="329" height="22" font="2">“<i>Drink</i>. Your king commands it.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned took the horn and drank. The beer was black and thick, so strong it stung </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">the eyes. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert sat down again. “Damn you, Ned Stark. You and Jon Arryn, I loved </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you both. What have you done to me? You were the one should have been king, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="124" height="22" font="2">you or Jon.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="395" height="22" font="2">“You had the better claim, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I told you to drink, not to argue. You made me king, you could at least have </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the courtesy to listen when I talk, damn you. Look at me, Ned. Look at what </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">kinging has done to me. Gods, too fat for my armor, how did it ever come to this?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="123" height="22" font="2">“Robert. . .” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Drink and stay quiet, the king is talking. I swear to you, I was never so alive </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I’ve won it. And </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Cersei. . . I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. I had no wish to marry after Lyanna </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was taken from me, but Jon said the realm needed an heir. Cersei Lannister would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">be a good match, he told me, she would bind Lord Tywin to me should Viserys </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Targaryen ever try to win back his father’s throne.” The king shook his head. “I </text>

<page number="247" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">loved that old man, I swear it, but now I think he was a bigger fool than Moon Boy. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Oh, Cersei is lovely to look at, truly, but  <i>cold</i> . . . the way she guards her cunt, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you’d think she had all the gold of Casterly Rock between her legs. Here, give me </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that beer if you won’t drink it.” He took  the horn, upended it, belched, wiped his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mouth. “I am sorry for your girl, Ned. Truly. About the wolf, I mean. My son was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="747" height="22" font="2">lying, I’d stake my soul on it. My son. . . you love your children, don’t you?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="298" height="22" font="2">“With all my heart,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Let me tell you a secret, Ned. More than once, I have dreamed of giving up </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the crown. Take ship for the Free Cities with my horse and my hammer, spend my </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">time warring and whoring, that’s what I was made for. The sellsword king, how the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">singers would love me. You know what stops me? The thought of Joffrey on the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">throne, with Cersei standing behind him whispering in his ear. My son. How could I </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">have made a son like that, Ned?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“He’s only a boy,” Ned said awkwardly. He had small liking for Prince </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Joffrey, but he could hear the pain in Robert’s voice. “Have you forgotten how wild </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">you were at his age?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It would not trouble me if the boy was wild, Ned. You don’t know him as I </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">do.” He sighed and shook his head. “Ah, perhaps you are right. Jon despaired of me </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">often enough, yet I grew into a good king.” Robert looked at Ned and scowled at his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="559" height="22" font="2">silence. “You might speak up and agree now, you know.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="383" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace. . .” Ned began, carefully. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert slapped Ned on the back. “Ah, say that I’m a better king than Aerys </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and be done with it. You never could lie for love nor honor, Ned Stark. I’m still </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">young, and now that you’re here with me, things will be different. We’ll make this a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">reign to sing of, and damn the Lannisters to seven hells. I smell bacon. Who do you </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">think our champion will be today? Have you seen Mace Tyrell’s boy? The Knight </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of Flowers, they call him. Now there’s a son any man would be proud to own to. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Last tourney, he dumped the Kingslayer on his golden rump, you ought to have </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">seen the look on Cersei’s face. I laughed till my sides hurt. Renly says he has this </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a dawn. . .” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They broke their fast on black bread and boiled goose eggs and fish fried up </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with onions and bacon, at a trestle table by the river’s edge. The king’s melancholy </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">melted away with the morning mist, and before long Robert was eating an orange </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and waxing fond about a morning at the Eyrie when they had been boys. “. . . had </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">given Jon a barrel of oranges, remember? Only the things had gone rotten, so I </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">flung mine across the table and hit Dacks right in the nose. You remember, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Redfort’s pock-faced squire? He tossed one back at me, and before Jon could so </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">much as fart, there were oranges flying across the High Hall in every direction.” He </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="569" height="22" font="2">laughed uproariously, and even Ned smiled, remembering. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">This was the boy he had grown up with, he thought; this was the Robert </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the attack on Bran, prove that they had murdered Jon Arryn, this man would listen. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Then Cersei would fall, and the Kingslayer with her, and if Lord Tywin dared to </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rouse the west, Robert would smash him as he had smashed Rhaegar Targaryen on </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="402" height="22" font="2">the Trident. He could see it all so clearly. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That breakfast tasted better than anything Eddard Stark had eaten in a long </text>

<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned walked with the king to the jousting field. He had promised to watch the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">final tilts with Sansa; Septa Mordane was ill today, and his daughter was </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">determined not to miss the end of the jousting. As he saw Robert to his place, he </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">noted that Cersei Lannister had chosen not to appear; the place beside the king was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">empty. That too gave Ned cause to hope. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He shouldered his way to where his daughter was seated and found her as the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">horns blew for the day’s first joust. Sansa was so engrossed she scarcely seemed to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">notice his arrival. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane was the first rider to appear. He wore an olive-  green cloak </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">over his soot-grey armor. That, and his  hound’s-head helm, were his only </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">concession to ornament. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A hundred golden dragons on the Kingslayer,” Littlefinger announced loudly </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as Jaime Lannister entered the lists, riding an elegant blood bay destrier. The horse </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wore a blanket of gilded ringmail, and Jaime glittered from head to heel. Even his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="623" height="22" font="2">lance was fashioned from the golden wood of the Summer Isles. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Done,” Lord Renly shouted back. “The Hound has a hungry look about him </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">this morning.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Even hungry dogs know better than to bite the hand that feeds them,” </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger called dryly. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane dropped his visor with an audible  <i>clang</i>  and took up his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">position. Ser Jaime tossed a kiss to some woman in the commons, gently lowered </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="704" height="22" font="2">his visor, and rode to the end of the lists. Both men couched their lances. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark would have loved nothing so well as to see them both lose, but </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Sansa was watching it all moist-eyed and eager. The hastily erected gallery </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">trembled as the horses broke into a gallop. The Hound leaned forward as he rode, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his lance rock steady, but Jaime shifted his seat deftly in the instant before impact. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Clegane’s point was turned harmlessly against the golden shield with the lion </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blazon, while his own hit square. Wood shattered, and the Hound reeled, fighting to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="704" height="22" font="2">keep his seat. Sansa gasped. A ragged cheer went up from the commons. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I wonder how I ought spend your money,” Littlefinger called down to Lord </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">Renly. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Hound just managed to stay in his saddle. He jerked his mount around </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hard and rode back to the lists for the second pass. Jaime Lannister tossed down his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">broken lance and snatched up a fresh one, jesting with his squire. The Hound </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">spurred forward at a hard gallop. Lannister rode to meet him. This time, when Jaime </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shifted his seat, Sandor Clegane shifted with him. Both lances exploded, and by the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">time the splinters had settled, a riderless blood bay was trotting off in search of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="666" height="22" font="2">grass while Ser Jaime Lannister rolled in the dirt, golden and dented. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="427" height="22" font="2">Sansa said, “I knew the Hound would win.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger overheard. “If you know who’s going to win the second match, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="780" height="22" font="2">speak up now before Lord Renly plucks me clean,” he called to her. Ned smiled. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A pity the Imp is not here with us,” Lord Renly said. “I should have won </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="160" height="22" font="2">twice as much.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister was back on his feet, but his ornate lion helmet had been </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">twisted around and dented in his fall, and now he could not get it off. The commons </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were hooting and pointing, the lords and ladies were trying to stifle their chuckles, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and failing, and over it all Ned could hear King Robert laughing, louder than </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">anyone. Finally they had to lead the Lion of Lannister off to a blacksmith, blind and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="108" height="22" font="2">stumbling. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By then Ser Gregor Clegane was in position at the head of the lists. He was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">huge, the biggest man that Eddard Stark had ever seen. Robert Baratheon and his </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brothers were all big men, as was the Hound, and back at Winterfell there was a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">simpleminded stableboy named Hodor who dwarfed them all, but the knight they </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">called the Mountain That Rides would have towered over Hodor. He was well over </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seven feet tall, closer to eight, with massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunks </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of small trees. His destrier seemed a pony in between his armored legs, and the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="500" height="22" font="2">lance he carried looked as small as a broom handle. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tywin when King’s Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity. Some said it had been Gregor </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">who’d dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">putting her to the sword. These things were not said in Gregor’s hearing. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ned  Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy’s rebellion, one knight among thousands. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He watched him with disquiet. Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous. He was soon to be married for the third </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was </text>

<page number="250" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall. And there had been a sister who had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">died young under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the hunting accident that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited the keep, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the gold, and the family estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">never returned, not even to visit. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When the Knight of Flowers made his entrance, a murmur ran through the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">crowd, and he heard Sansa’s fervent whisper, “Oh, he’s so  <i>beautiful</i>.” Ser Loras </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrell was slender as a reed, dressed in a suit of fabulous silver armor polished to a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">blinding sheen and filigreed with twining black vines and tiny blue forget-me-nots. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The commons realized in the same instant as Ned that the blue of the flowers came </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from sapphires; a gasp went up from a thousand throats. Across the boy’s shoulders </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his cloak hung heavy. It was woven of forget-me-nots, real ones, hundreds of fresh </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">blooms sewn to a heavy woolen cape. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His courser was as slim as her rider, a beautiful grey mare, built for speed. Ser </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Gregor’s huge stallion trumpeted as he caught her scent. The boy from Highgarden </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">did something with his legs, and his horse pranced sideways, nimble as a dancer. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa clutched  at his arm. “Father, don’t let Ser Gregor hurt him,” she said. Ned </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw she was wearing the rose that Ser Loras had given her yesterday. Jory had told </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="224" height="22" font="2">him about that as well. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“These are tourney lances,” he told his daughter. “They make them to splinter </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on impact, so no one is hurt.” Yet he remembered the dead boy in the cart with his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="607" height="22" font="2">cloak of crescent moons, and the words were raw in his throat. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Ser Gregor was having trouble controlling his horse. The stallion was </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">screaming and pawing the ground, shaking his head. The Mountain kicked at the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="767" height="22" font="2">animal savagely with an armored boot. The horse reared and almost threw him. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Knight of Flowers saluted the king, rode to the far end of the list, and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">couched his lance, ready. Ser Gregor brought his animal to the line, fighting with </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the reins. And suddenly it began. The Mountain’s stallion broke in a hard gallop, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">plunging forward wildly, while the mare charged as smooth as a flow of silk. Ser </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Gregor wrenched his shield into position, juggled with his lance, and all the while </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fought to hold his unruly mount on a straight line, and suddenly Loras Tyrell was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on him, placing the point of his lance just <i>there</i>, and in an eye blink the Mountain </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was failing. He was so huge that he took his horse down with him in a tangle of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">steel and flesh. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned heard applause, cheers, whistles, shocked gasps, excited muttering, and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">over it all the rasping, raucous laughter of the Hound. The Knight of Flowers reined </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">up at the end of the lists. His lance was not even broken. His sapphires winked in </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">the sun as he raised his visor, smiling. The commons went mad for him. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">In the middle of the field, Ser Gregor Clegane disentangled himself and came </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">boiling to his feet. He wrenched off his helm and slammed it down onto the ground. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">His face was dark with fury and his hair fell down into his eyes. “My sword,” he </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shouted to his squire, and the boy ran it out to him. By then his stallion was back on </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="150" height="22" font="2">its feet as well. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Gregor Clegane killed the horse with a single blow of such ferocity that it half </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">severed the animal’s neck. Cheers turned to shrieks in a heartbeat. The stallion went </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to its knees, screaming as it died. By then Gregor was striding down the lists toward </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Ser Loras Tyrell, his bloody sword clutched in his fist. “<i>Stop him!</i>” Ned shouted, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but his words were lost in the roar. Everyone else was yelling as well, and Sansa </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">was crying. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It all happened so fast. The Knight of Flowers was shouting for his own sword </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as Ser Gregor knocked his squire aside and made a grab for the reins of his horse. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">The mare scented blood and reared. Loras Tyrell kept his seat, but barely. Ser </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Gregor swung his sword, a savage two-handed blow that took the boy in the chest </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and knocked him from the saddle. The courser dashed away in panic as Ser Loras </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lay stunned in the dirt. But as Gregor lifted his sword for the killing blow, a rasping </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">voice warned, “<i>Leave him be</i>,” and a steel-clad hand wrenched him away from the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="48" height="22" font="2">boy. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Mountain pivoted in wordless fury, swinging his longsword in a killing </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">arc with all his massive strength behind  it, but the Hound caught the blow and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">turned it, and for what seemed an eternity the two brothers stood hammering at each </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">other as a dazed Loras Tyrell was helped to safety. Thrice Ned saw Ser Gregor aim </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">savage blows at the hound’s-head helmet, yet not once did Sandor send a cut at his </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">brother’s unprotected face. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">It was the king’s voice that put an end to it. . . the king’s voice and twenty </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swords. Jon Arryn had told them that a commander needs a good battlefield voice, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and Robert had proved the truth of that on the Trident. He used that voice now. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">“STOP THIS MADNESS,” he boomed, “IN THE NAME OF YOUR KING!” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Hound went to one knee. Ser Gregor’s blow cut air, and at last he came to </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">his senses. He dropped his sword and glared at Robert, surrounded by his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard and a dozen other knights and guardsmen. Wordlessly, he turned and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">strode off, shoving past Barristan Selmy. “Let him go,” Robert said, and as quickly </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">as that, it was over. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“Is the Hound the champion now?” Sansa asked Ned. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” he told her. “There will be one final joust, between the Hound and the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">Knight of Flowers.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">But Sansa had the right of it after all. A few moments later Ser Loras Tyrell </text>

<page number="252" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">walked back onto the field in a simple linen doublet and said to Sandor Clegane, “I </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="390" height="22" font="2">owe you my life. The day is yours, ser.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I am no <i>ser</i>,” the Hound replied, but he took the victory, and the champion’s </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">purse, and, for perhaps the first time in his life, the love of the commons. They </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="534" height="22" font="2">cheered him as he left the lists to return to his pavilion. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">As Ned walked with Sansa to the archery field, Littlefinger and Lord Renly </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and some of the others fell in with them. “Tyrell had to know the mare was in heat,” </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger was saying. “I swear the boy planned the whole thing. Gregor has </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">always favored huge, ill-tempered stallions with more spirit than sense.” The notion </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">seemed to amuse him. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It did not amuse Ser Barristan Selmy. “There is small honor in tricks,” the old </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">man said stiffly. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="606" height="22" font="2">“Small honor and twenty thousand golds.” Lord Renly smiled. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dornish Marches, won the archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">the Hand’s guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">undreamed of, and he refused. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The melee went on for three hours. Near forty men took part, freeriders and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hedge knights and new-made squires in search of a reputation. They fought with </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blunted weapons in a chaos of mud and blood, small troops fighting together and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">then turning on each other as alliances formed and fractured, until only one man </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was left standing. The victor was the red priest, Thoros of Myr, a madman who </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shaved his head and fought with a flaming sword. He had won melees before; the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fire sword frightened the mounts of the other riders, and nothing frightened Thoros. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">The final tally was three broken limbs, a shattered collarbone, a dozen smashed </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fingers, two horses that had to be put down, and more cuts, sprains, and bruises than </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="804" height="22" font="2">anyone cared to count. Ned was desperately pleased that Robert had not taken part. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That night at the feast, Eddard Stark was more hopeful than he had been in a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">great while. Robert was in high good humor, the Lannisters were nowhere to be </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seen, and even his daughters were behaving. Jory brought Arya down to join them, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and Sansa spoke to her sister pleasantly. “The tournament was  <i>magnificent</i>,” she </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">sighed. “You should have come. How was your dancing?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I’m sore all over,” Arya reported happily, proudly displaying a huge purple </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">bruise on her leg. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="537" height="22" font="2">“You must be a terrible dancer,” Sansa said doubtfully. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Later, while Sansa was off listening to a troupe of singers perform the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">complex round of interwoven ballads called the “Dance of the Dragons,” Ned </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">inspected the bruise himself. “I hope Forel is not being too hard on you,” he said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya stood on one leg. She was getting much better at that of late. “Syrio says </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="609" height="22" font="2">that every hurt is a lesson, and every lesson makes you better.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya’s slender blade, yet still. . . a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her eyes. Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin, she </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">told him. Before that, he had her doing spins and back flips. “Arya, are you certain </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="275" height="22" font="2">you want to persist in this?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="507" height="22" font="2">She nodded. “Tomorrow we’re going to catch cats.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Cats.” Ned sighed. “Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">like, I will ask Jory to take over your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">“I don’t want them,” Arya said. “I want Syrio.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned ran his fingers through his hair. Any decent master-at-arms could give </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">Arya the rudiments of slash-and-parry without this nonsense of blindfolds, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cartwheels, and hopping about on one leg, but he knew his youngest daughter well </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">enough to know there was no arguing with that stubborn jut of jaw. “As you wish,” </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="675" height="22" font="2">he said. Surely she would grow tired of this soon. “Try to be careful.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I will,” she promised solemnly as she hopped smoothly from her right leg to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">her left. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Much later, after he had taken the girls back through the city and seen them </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">both safe in bed, Sansa with her dreams and Arya with her bruises, Ned ascended to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his own chambers atop the Tower of the Hand. The day had been warm and the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">room was close and stuffy. Ned went to the window and unfastened the heavy </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shutters to let in the cool night air. Across the Great Yard, he noticed the flickering </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">glow of candlelight from Littlefinger’s windows. The hour was well past midnight. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="727" height="22" font="2">Down by the river, the revels were only now beginning to dwindle and die. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He took out the dagger and studied it. Littlefinger’s blade, won by Tyrion </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lannister in a tourney wager, sent to slay Bran in his sleep. <i>Why?</i> Why would the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">dwarf want Bran dead? Why would <i>anyone</i> want Bran dead? </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The dagger, Bran’s fall, all of it was linked somehow to the murder of Jon </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Arryn, he could feel it in his gut, but the truth of Jon’s death remained as clouded to </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him as when he had started. Lord Stannis had not returned to King’s Landing for </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the  tourney. Lysa Arryn held her silence behind the high walls of the Eyrie. The </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">squire was dead, and Jory was still searching the whorehouses. What did he have </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">but Robert’s bastard? </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That the armorer’s sullen apprentice was the king’s son, Ned had no doubt. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The Baratheon look was stamped on his face, in his jaw, his eyes, that black hair. </text>
</page>
<page number="254" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Renly was too young to have fathered a boy of that age, Stannis too cold and proud </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">in his honor. Gendry had to be Robert’s. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Yet knowing all that, what had he learned? The king  had other baseborn </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">children scattered throughout the Seven Kingdoms. He had openly acknowledged </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one of his bastards, a boy of Bran’s age whose mother was highborn. The lad was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">being fostered by Lord Renly’s castellan at Storm’s End. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned remembered Robert’s first child as well, a daughter born in the Vale </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">when Robert was scarcely more than a boy himself. A sweet little girl; the young </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lord of Storm’s End had doted on her. He used to make daily visits to play with the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">babe, long after he had lost interest in the mother. Ned was often dragged along for </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">company, whether he willed it or not. The girl would be seventeen or eighteen now, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="2">he realized; older than Robert had been when he fathered her. A strange thought. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Cersei could not have been pleased by her lord husband’s by-blows, yet in the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">end it mattered little whether the king had one bastard or a hundred. Law and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">custom gave the baseborn few rights. Gendry, the girl in the Vale, the boy at </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="705" height="22" font="2">Storm’s End, none of them could threaten Robert’s trueborn children. . .  </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His musings were ended by a soft rap on his door. “A man to see you, my </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="489" height="22" font="2">lord,” Harwin called. “He will not give his name.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">“Send him in,” Ned said, wondering. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The visitor was a stout man in cracked, mud-caked boots and a heavy brown </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">robe of the coarsest roughspun, his features hidden by a cowl, his hands drawn up </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">into voluminous sleeves. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="275" height="22" font="2">“Who are you?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A friend,” the cowled man said in a strange, low voice. “We must speak </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">alone, Lord Stark.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Curiosity was stronger than caution. “Harwin, leave us,” he commanded. Not </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="742" height="22" font="2">until they were alone behind closed doors did his visitor draw back his cowl. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="402" height="22" font="2">“<i>Lord Varys?</i>” Ned said in astonishment. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Lord Stark,” Varys said politely, seating himself. “I wonder if I might trouble </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">you for a drink?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned filled two cups with summerwine and handed one to Varys. “I might have </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">passed within a foot of you and never recognized you,” he said, incredulous. He had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">never seen the eunuch dress in anything but silk and velvet and the richest damasks, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">and this man smelled of sweat instead of lilacs. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“That was my dearest hope,” Varys said. “It would not do if certain people </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">learned that we had spoken in private. The queen watches you closely. This wine is </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">very choice. Thank you.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“How did you get past my other guards?” Ned asked. Porther and Cayn had </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">been posted outside the tower, and Alyn on the stairs. </text>
</page>
<page number="255" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Red Keep has ways known only to ghosts and spiders.” Varys smiled </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">apologetically. “I will not keep you long, my lord. There are things you must know. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">You are the King’s Hand, and the king is a fool.” The eunuch’s cloying tones were </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gone; now his voice was thin and sharp as a whip. “Your friend, I know, yet a fool </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nonetheless . . . and doomed, unless you save him. Today was a near thing. They </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">had hoped to kill him during the melee.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="537" height="22" font="2">For a moment Ned was speechless with shock. “<i>Who?</i>” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Varys sipped his wine. “If I truly need to tell you that, you are a bigger fool </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">than Robert and I am on the wrong side.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Lannisters,” Ned said. “The queen. . . no, I will not believe that, not even </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">of Cersei. She asked him not to fight!” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“She  <i>forbade</i>  him to fight, in front of his brother, his knights, and half the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">court. Tell me truly, do you know any surer way to force King Robert into the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">melee? I ask you.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned had a sick feeling in his gut. The eunuch had hit upon a truth; tell Robert </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Baratheon he could not, should not, or must not do a thing, and it was as good as </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="682" height="22" font="2">done. “Even if he’d fought, who would have dared to strike the king?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Varys shrugged. “There were forty riders in the melee. The Lannisters have </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">many friends. Amidst all that chaos, with horses screaming and bones breaking and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Thoros of Myr waving that absurd firesword of his, who could name it murder if </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">some chance blow felled His Grace?” He went to the flagon and refilled his cup. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“After  the deed was done, the slayer would be beside himself with grief. I can </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">almost hear him weeping. So sad. Yet no doubt the gracious and compassionate </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">widow would take pity, lift the poor unfortunate to his feet, and bless him with a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gentle kiss of forgiveness. Good King Joffrey would have no choice but to pardon </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him.” The eunuch stroked his cheek. “Or perhaps Cersei would let Ser Ilyn strike </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">off his head. Less risk for the Lannisters that way, though quite an unpleasant </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">surprise for their little friend.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="707" height="22" font="2">Ned felt his anger rise. “You knew of this plot, and yet you did nothing.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="381" height="22" font="2">“I command whisperers, not warriors.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="373" height="22" font="2">“You might have come to me earlier.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, yes, I confess it. And you would have rushed straight to the king, yes? </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="722" height="22" font="2">And when Robert heard of his peril, what would he have done? I wonder.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned considered that. “He would have damned them all, and fought anyway, to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">show he did not fear them.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Varys spread his hands. “I will make another confession, Lord Eddard. I was </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">curious to see what you would do.  <i>Why not come to me?</i>  you ask, and I must </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">answer, <i>Why, because I did not trust you, my lord.</i>” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="515" height="22" font="2">“You did not trust me?” Ned was frankly astonished. </text>
</page>
<page number="256" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“The Red Keep shelters two sorts of people, Lord Eddard,” Varys said. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“Those who are loyal to the realm, and those who are loyal only to themselves. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Until this morning, I could not say which you might be. . . so I waited to see. . . and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">now I know, for a certainty.” He smiled a plump tight little smile, and for a moment </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his private face and public mask were one. “I begin to comprehend why the queen </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">fears you so much. Oh, yes I do.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="449" height="22" font="2">“You are the one she ought to fear,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No. I am what I am. The king makes use of me, but it shames him. A most </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">puissant warrior is our Robert, and such a manly man has little love for sneaks and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">spies and eunuchs. If a day should come when Cersei whispers, ‘Kill that man,’ Ilyn </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Payne will snick my head off in a twinkling, and who will mourn poor Varys then? </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">North or south, they sing no songs for spiders.” He reached out and touched Ned </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with a soft hand. “But you, Lord Stark. . . I think. . . no, I <i>know</i> . . . he would not kill </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="593" height="22" font="2">you, not even for his queen, and there may lie our salvation.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was all too much. For a moment Eddard Stark wanted nothing so much as to </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">return to Winterfell, to the clean simplicity of the north, where the enemies were </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">winter and the wildlings beyond the Wall. “Surely Robert has other loyal friends,” </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cowl so his face was hidden once more. “Thank you for the wine. We will speak </text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He was at the door when Ned called, “<i>Varys</i>.” The eunuch turned back. “How </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="196" height="22" font="2">did Jon Arryn die?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="483" height="22" font="2">“I wondered when you would get around to that.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="107" height="22" font="2">“Tell me.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The tears of Lys,  they call it. A rare and costly thing, clear and sweet as </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">water, and it leaves no trace. I begged Lord Arryn to use a taster, in this very room I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">begged him, but he would not hear of it. Only one who was less than a man would </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">even think of such a thing, he told me.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="537" height="22" font="2">Ned had to know the rest. “Who gave him the poison?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Some dear sweet friend who often shared meat and mead with him, no doubt. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Oh, but which one? There were many such. Lord Arryn was a kindly, trusting </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">man.” The eunuch sighed. “There <i>was</i> one boy. All he was, he owed Jon Arryn, but </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">when the widow fled to the Eyrie with her household, he stayed in King’s Landing </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and prospered. It always gladdens my heart to see the young rise in the world.” The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">whip was in his voice again, every word a stroke. “He must have cut a gallant figure </text>

<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned felt half-poisoned himself. “The squire,” he said. “Ser Hugh.” Wheels </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">within wheels within wheels. Ned’s head was pounding. “<i>Why?  </i>Why now? Jon </text>

<text top="318" left="133" width="743" height="22" font="2">inside the carcass when the squat sellsword opened the belly with his </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">skinning knife. His hands moved deftly, with never a wasted cut; the work had to be </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="805" height="22" font="2">done quickly, before the stink of blood brought shadowcats down from the heights. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“None of us will go hungry tonight,” Bronn said. He was near a shadow </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">himself; bone thin and bone hard, with black eyes and black hair and a stubble of </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">beard. </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Some of us may,” Tyrion told him. “I am not fond of eating horse. </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">Particularly <i>my</i> horse.” </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Meat is meat,” Bronn said with a shrug. “The Dothraki like horse more than </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="140" height="22" font="2">beef or pork.” </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Do you take me for a Dothraki?” Tyrion asked sourly. The Dothraki ate </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">horse, in truth; they also left deformed children out for the feral dogs who ran </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="650" height="22" font="2">behind their <i>khalasars</i>. Dothraki customs had scant appeal for him. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Chiggen sliced a thin strip of bloody meat off the carcass and held it up for </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">inspection. “Want a taste, dwarf?” </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My brother Jaime gave me that mare for my twenty-third name day,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="188" height="22" font="2">said in a flat voice. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Thank him for us, then. If you ever see him again.” Chiggen grinned, </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">showing yellow teeth, and swallowed the raw meat in two bites. “Tastes well bred.” </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="490" height="22" font="2">“Better if you fry it up with onions,” Bronn put in. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Wordlessly, Tyrion limped away. The cold had settled deep in his bones, and </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his legs were so sore he could scarcely walk. Perhaps his dead mare was the lucky </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">one. He had hours more riding ahead of him, followed by a few mouthfuls of food </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and a short, cold sleep on hard ground, and then another night of the same, and </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">another, and another, and the gods only knew how it would end. “Damn her,” he </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">muttered as he struggled up the road to rejoin his captors, remembering, “damn her </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">and all the Starks.” </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The memory was still bitter. One moment he’d been ordering supper, and an </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eye blink later he was facing a room of armed men, with Jyck reaching for a sword </text>

<page number="259" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="677" height="22" font="2">and the fat innkeep shrieking, “No swords, not <i>here</i>, please, m’lords.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion wrenched down Jyck’s arm hurriedly, before he got them both hacked </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to pieces. “Where are your courtesies, Jyck? Our good hostess said no swords. Do </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as she asks.” He forced a smile that must have looked as queasy as it felt. “You’re </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">making a sad mistake, Lady Stark. I had no part in any attack on your son. On my </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">honor—” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lannister honor,” was all she said. She held up her hands for all the room to </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">see. “His dagger left these scars. The blade he sent to open my son’s throat.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion felt the anger all around him, thick and smoky, fed by the deep cuts in </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Stark woman’s hands. “Kill him,” hissed some drunken slattern from the back, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and other voices took up the call, faster than he would have believed. Strangers all, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">friendly enough only a moment ago, and yet now they cried for his blood like </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">hounds on a trail. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion spoke up loudly, trying to keep the quaver from his voice. “If Lady </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Stark believes I have some crime to answer for, I will go with her and answer for </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="36" height="22" font="2">it.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was the only possible course. Trying to cut their way out of this was a sure </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">invitation to an early grave. A good dozen swords had responded to the Stark </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">woman’s plea for help: the Harrenhal man, the three Brackens, a pair of unsavory </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sellswords who looked as though they’d kill him as soon as spit, and some fool field </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">hands who doubtless had no idea what they were doing. Against that, what did </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tyrion have? A dagger at his belt, and two men. Jyck swung a fair enough sword, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but Morrec scarcely counted; he was part groom, part cook, part body servant, and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">no soldier. As for Yoren, whatever his feelings might have been, the black brothers </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="780" height="22" font="2">were sworn to take no part in the quarrels of the realm. Yoren would do nothing. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And indeed, the black brother stepped aside silently when the old knight by </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark’s side said, “Take their weapons,” and the sellsword Bronn stepped </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forward to pull the sword from Jyck’s fingers and relieve them all of their daggers. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“Good,” the old man said as the tension in the common room ebbed palpably, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“excellent.” Tyrion recognized the gruff voice; Winterfell’s master-at-arms, shorn </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="157" height="22" font="2">of his whiskers. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep’s mouth as she begged of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark, “Don’t kill him here!” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="408" height="22" font="2">“Don’t kill him anywhere,” Tyrion urged. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Take him somewheres else, no blood here, m’lady, I wants no high lordlin’s </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="100" height="22" font="2">quarrels.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We are taking him back to Winterfell,” she said, and Tyrion thought,  <i>Well, </i></text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>perhaps</i> . . . By then he’d had a moment to glance over the room and get a better </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">idea of the situation. He was not altogether displeased by what he saw. Oh, the </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Stark woman had been clever, no doubt of it. Force them to make a public </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">affirmation of the oaths sworn her father by the lords they served, and then call on </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them for succor, and her a woman, yes, that was sweet. Yet her success was not as </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">complete as she might have liked. There were close to fifty in the common room by </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his rough count. Catelyn Stark’s plea had roused a bare dozen; the others looked </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">confused, or frightened, or sullen. Only two of the Freys had stirred, Tyrion noted, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and they’d sat back down quick enough when their captain failed to move. He </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">might have smiled if he’d dared. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Winterfell it is, then,” he said instead. That was a long ride, as he could well </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">attest, having just ridden it the other way. So many things could happen along the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">way. “My father will wonder what has become of me,” he added, catching the eye </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">of the swordsman who’d offered to yield up his room. “He’ll pay a handsome </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">reward to any man who brings him word of what happened here today.” Lord </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Tywin would do no such thing, of course, but Tyrion would make up for it if he </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">won free. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik glanced at his lady, his look worried, as well it might be. “His men </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">come with him,” the old knight announced. “And we’ll thank the rest of you to stay </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="351" height="22" font="2">quiet about what you’ve seen here.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">It was all Tyrion could do not to laugh. <i>Quiet</i>? The old fool. Unless he took </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the whole inn, the word would begin to spread the instant they were gone. The </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">freerider with the gold coin in his pocket would fly to Casterly Rock like an arrow. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">If not him, then someone else. Yoren would carry the story south. That fool singer </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">might make a lay of it. The Freys would report back to their lord, and the gods only </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knew what he might do. Lord Walder Frey might be sworn to Riverrun, but he was </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a cautious man who had lived a long time by making certain he was always on the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">winning side. At the very least he would send his birds winging south to King’s </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">Landing, and he might well dare more than that. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark wasted no time. “We must ride at once. We’ll want fresh </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">mounts, and provisions for the road. You men, know that you have the eternal </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gratitude of House Stark. If any of you choose to help us guard our captives and get </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">them safe to Winterfell, I promise you shall be well rewarded.” That was all it took; </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the fools came rushing forward. Tyrion studied their faces; they would indeed be </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="739" height="22" font="2">well rewarded, he vowed to himself, but perhaps not quite as they imagined. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Yet even as they were bundling him outside, saddling the horses in the rain, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and tying his hands with a length of coarse rope, Tyrion Lannister was not truly </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">afraid. They would never get him to Winterfell, he would have given odds on that. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Riders would be after them within the day, birds would take wing, and surely one of </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the river lords would want to curry favor with his father enough to take a hand. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was congratulating himself on his subtlety when someone pulled a hood </text>
</page>
<page number="261" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="500" height="22" font="2">down over his eyes and lifted him up onto a saddle. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They set out through the rain at a hard gallop, and before long Tyrion’s thighs </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">were cramped and aching and his butt throbbed with pain. Even when they were </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">safely away from the inn, and Catelyn Stark slowed them to a trot, it was a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">miserable pounding journey over rough ground, made worse by his blindness. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Every twist and turn put him in danger of falling off his horse. The hood muffled </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sound, so he could not make out what was being said around him, and the rain </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soaked through the cloth and made it cling to his face, until even breathing was a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">struggle. The rope chafed his wrists raw and seemed to grow tighter as the night </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wore on.  <i>I was about to settle down to a warm fire and a roast fowl, and that </i></text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>wretched singer had to open his mouth</i>, he thought mournfully. The wretched singer </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had come along with them. “There is a great song to be made from this, and I’m the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">one to make it,” he told Catelyn Stark when he announced his intention of riding </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">with them to see how the “splendid adventure” turned out. Tyrion wondered </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">whether the boy would think the adventure quite so splendid once the Lannister </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">riders caught up with them. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The rain had finally stopped and dawn light was seeping through the wet cloth </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">over his eyes when Catelyn Stark gave the command to dismount. Rough hands </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pulled him down from his horse, untied his wrists, and yanked the hood off his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">head. When he saw the narrow stony road, the foothills rising high and wild all </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around them, and the jagged snowcapped peaks on the distant horizon, all the hope </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">went out of him in a rush. “This is the high road,” he gasped, looking at Lady Stark </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="746" height="22" font="2">with accusation. “The <i>eastern</i> road. You said we were riding for Winterfell!” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark favored him with the faintest of smiles. “Often and loudly,” she </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">agreed. “No doubt your friends will ride that way when they come after us. I wish </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">them good speed.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Even now, long days later, the memory filled him with a bitter rage. All his </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">life Tyrion had prided himself on his cunning, the only gift the gods had seen fit to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">give him, and yet this seven-times-damned she-wolf Catelyn Stark had outwitted </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">him at every turn. The knowledge was more galling than the bare fact of his </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">abduction. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They stopped only as long as it took to feed and water the horses, and then </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they were off again. This time Tyrion was spared the hood. After the second night </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they no longer bound his hands, and once they had gained the heights they scarcely </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bothered to guard him at all. It seemed they did not fear his escape. And why should </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">they? Up here the land was harsh and wild, and the high road little more than a </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">stony track. If he did run, how far could he hope to go, alone and without </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">provisions? The shadowcats would make a morsel of him, and the clans that dwelt </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the mountain fastnesses were brigands and murderers who bowed to no law but </text>

<page number="262" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">the sword. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Yet still the Stark woman drove them forward relentlessly. He knew where </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">they were bound. He had known it since the moment they pulled off his hood. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">These mountains were the domain of House Arryn, and the late Hand’s widow was </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a Tully, Catelyn Stark’s sister. . . and no friend to the Lannisters. Tyrion had known </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the Lady Lysa slightly during her years at King’s Landing, and did not look forward </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">to renewing the acquaintance. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His captors were clustered around a stream a short ways down the high road. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The horses had drunk their fill of the icy cold water, and were grazing on clumps of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">brown grass that grew from clefts in the rock. Jyck and Morrec huddled close, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sullen and miserable. Mohor stood over them, leaning on his spear and wearing a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">rounded iron cap that made him look as if he had a bowl on his head. Nearby, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Marillion the singer sat oiling his woodharp, complaining of what the damp was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">doing to his strings. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“We must have some rest, my lady,” the hedge  knight Ser Willis Wode was </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">saying to Catelyn Stark as Tyrion approached. He was Lady Whent’s man, stiff-</text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">necked and stolid, and the first to rise to aid Catelyn Stark back at the inn. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Ser Willis speaks truly, my lady,” Ser Rodrik said. “This is the third horse </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">we have lost—” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“We will lose more than horses if we’re overtaken by the Lannisters,” she </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">reminded them. Her face was windburnt and gaunt, but it had lost none of its </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">determination. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="416" height="22" font="2">“Small chance of that here,” Tyrion put in. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The lady did not ask your views, dwarf,” snapped Kurleket, a great fat oaf </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">with short-cropped hair and a pig’s face. He was one of the Brackens, a man-at-</text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">arms in the service of Lord Jonos. Tyrion had made a special effort to learn all their </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">names, so he might thank them later for their tender treatment of him. A Lannister </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">always paid his debts. Kurleket would learn that someday, as would his friends </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lharys and Mohor, and the good Ser Willis, and the sellswords Bronn and Chiggen. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He planned an especially sharp lesson for Marillion, him of the woodharp and the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sweet tenor voice, who was struggling so manfully to rhyme  <i>imp</i>  with  <i>gimp</i>  and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="441" height="22" font="4"><i>limp</i> so he could make a song of this outrage. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="411" height="22" font="2">“Let him speak,” Lady Stark commanded. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister seated himself on a rock. “By now our pursuit is  likely </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">racing across the Neck, chasing your lie up the kingsroad. . . assuming there is a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">pursuit, which is by no means certain. Oh, no doubt the word has reached my </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father. . . but my father does not love me overmuch, and I am not at all sure that he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">will bother to bestir himself.” It was only half a lie; Lord Tywin Lannister cared not </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a fig for his deformed son, but he tolerated no slights on the honor of his House. </text>
</page>
<page number="263" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“This is a cruel land, Lady Stark. You’ll find no succor until you reach the Vale, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and each mount you lose burdens the others all the more. Worse, you risk losing </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>me</i>. I am small, and not strong, and if I die, then what’s the point?” That was no lie </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">at all; Tyrion did not know how much longer he could endure this pace. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“It might be said that your death  <i>is</i>  the point, Lannister,” Catelyn Stark </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">replied. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I think not,” Tyrion said. “If you wanted me dead, you had only to say the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">word, and one of these staunch friends of yours would gladly have given me a red </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">smile.” He looked at Kurleket, but the man was too dim to taste the mockery. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="451" height="22" font="2">“The Starks do not murder men in their beds.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Nor do I,” he said. “I tell you again, I had no part in the attempt to kill your </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">son.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="433" height="22" font="2">“The assassin was armed with your dagger.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion felt the heat rise in him. “It was not my dagger,” he insisted. “How </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">many times must I swear to that? Lady Stark, whatever you may believe of me, I </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">am not a stupid man. Only a fool would arm a common footpad with his own </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">blade.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Just for a moment, he thought he saw a flicker of doubt in her eyes, but what </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">she said was, “Why would Petyr lie to me?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Why does a bear shit in the woods?” he demanded. “Because it is his nature. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lying comes as easily as breathing to a man like Littlefinger.  <i>You</i>  ought to know </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">that, you of all people.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">She took a step toward him, her face tight. “And what does that mean, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="118" height="22" font="2">Lannister?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion cocked his head. “Why, every man at court has heard him tell how he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">took your maidenhead, my lady.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="337" height="22" font="2">“<i>That is a lie!</i>” Catelyn Stark said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="475" height="22" font="2">“Oh, wicked little imp,” Marillion said, shocked. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Kurleket drew his dirk, a vicious piece of black iron. “At your word, m’lady, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I’ll toss his lying tongue at your feet.” His pig eyes were wet with excitement at the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">prospect. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark stared at Tyrion with a coldness on her face such as he had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">never  seen. “Petyr Baelish loved me once. He was only a boy. His passion was a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tragedy for all of us, but it was real, and pure, and nothing to be made mock of. He </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">wanted my hand. That is the truth of the matter. You are truly an evil man, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">Lannister.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And you are truly a fool, Lady Stark. Littlefinger has never loved anyone but </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger, and I promise you that it is not your <i>hand</i> that he boasts of, it’s those </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">ripe breasts of yours, and that sweet mouth, and the heat between your legs.” </text>

<page number="264" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Kurleket grabbed a handful of hair and yanked his head back in a hard jerk, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">baring his throat. Tyrion felt the cold kiss of steel beneath his chin. “Shall I bleed </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">him, my lady?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="512" height="22" font="2">“Kill me and the truth dies with me,” Tyrion gasped. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="417" height="22" font="2">“Let him talk,” Catelyn Stark commanded. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="429" height="22" font="2">Kurleket let go of Tyrion’s hair, reluctantly. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion took a deep breath. “How did Littlefinger tell you I came by this </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">dagger of his? Answer me that.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You won it from him in a wager, during the tourney on Prince Joffrey’s </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">name day.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“When my brother Jaime was unhorsed by the Knight of Flowers, that was his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">story, no?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="466" height="22" font="2">“It was,” she admitted. A line creased her brow. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="98" height="22" font="2">“<i>Riders!</i>” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The shriek came from the wind-carved ridge above them. Ser Rodrik had sent </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">Lharys scrambling up the rock face to watch the road while they took their rest. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">For a long second, no one moved. Catelyn Stark was the first to react. “Ser </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Rodrik, Ser Willis, to horse,” she shouted. “Get the other mounts behind us. Mohor, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">guard the prisoners—” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Arm us!” Tyrion sprang to his feet and seized her by the arm. “You will need </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">every sword.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She knew he was right, Tyrion could see it. The mountain clans cared nothing </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for the enmities of the great houses; they would slaughter Stark and Lannister with </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">equal fervor, as they slaughtered each other. They might spare Catelyn herself; she </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="542" height="22" font="2">was still young enough to bear sons. Still, she hesitated. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>I hear them!</i>” Ser Rodrik called out. Tyrion turned his head to listen, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there it was: hoofbeats, a dozen horses or more, coming nearer. Suddenly everyone </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="585" height="22" font="2">was moving, reaching for weapons, running to their mounts. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Pebbles rained down around them as Lharys came springing and sliding down </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the ridge. He landed breathless in front of Catelyn Stark, an ungainly-looking man </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">with wild tufts of rust-colored hair sticking out from under a conical steel cap. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">“Twenty men, maybe twenty-five,” he said, breathless. “Milk Snakes or Moon </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Brothers, by my guess. They must have eyes out, m’lady. . . hidden </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">watchers. . . they know we’re here.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik Cassel was already ahorse, a longsword in hand. Mohor crouched </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">behind a boulder, both hands on his iron-tipped spear, a dagger between his teeth. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">“You, singer,” Ser Willis Wode called out. “Help me with this breastplate.” </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion kept his grip on Catelyn Stark. “You have no choice,” he told her. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">“Three of us, and a fourth man wasted guarding us. . . four men can be the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="420" height="22" font="2">difference between life and death up here.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Give me your word that you will put down your swords again after the fight </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">is done.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My word?” The hoofbeats were louder now. Tyrion grinned crookedly. “Oh, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="540" height="22" font="2">that you have, my lady. . . on my honor as a Lannister.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">For a moment he thought she would spit at him, but instead she snapped, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Arm them,” and as quick as that she was pulling away. Ser Rodrik tossed Jyck his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sword and scabbard, and wheeled to meet the foe. Morrec helped himself to a bow </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and quiver, and went to one knee  beside the road. He was a better archer than </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">swordsman. And Bronn rode up to offer Tyrion a double-bladed axe. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I have never fought with an axe.” The weapon felt awkward and unfamiliar </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">in his hands. It had a short haft, a heavy head, a nasty spike on top. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Pretend you’re splitting logs,” Bronn said, drawing his longsword from the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">scabbard across his back. He spat, and trotted off to form up beside Chiggen and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik. Ser Willis mounted up to join them, fumbling with his helmet, a metal </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">pot with a thin slit for his eyes and a long black silk plume. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Logs don’t bleed,” Tyrion said to no one in particular. He felt naked without </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">armor. He looked around for a rock and ran over to where Marillion was hiding. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="138" height="22" font="2">“Move over.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Go away!” the boy screamed back at him. “I’m a singer, I want no part of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">this fight!” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What, lost your taste for adventure?” Tyrion kicked at the youth until he slid </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="738" height="22" font="2">over, and not a moment too soon. A heartbeat later, the riders were on them. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">There were no heralds, no banners, no horns nor drums, only the twang of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">bowstrings as Morrec and Lharys let fly, and suddenly the clansmen came </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thundering out of the dawn, lean dark men in boiled leather and mismatched armor, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">faces hidden behind barred halfhelms. In gloved hands were clutched all manner of </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">weapons: longswords and lances and sharpened scythes, spiked clubs and daggers </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and heavy iron mauls. At their head rode a big man in a striped shadowskin cloak, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">armed with a two-handed greatsword. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik shouted “<i>Winterfell!</i>” and rode to meet him, with Bronn and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Chiggen beside him, screaming some wordless battle cry. Ser Willis Wode </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">followed, swinging a spiked morningstar around his head. “Harrenhal! Harrenhal!” </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">he sang. Tyrion felt a sudden urge to leap up, brandish his axe, and boom out, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Casterly Rock!” but the insanity passed quickly and he crouched down lower. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He heard the screams of frightened horses and the crash of metal on metal. </text>

<page number="266" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Chiggen’s sword raked across the naked face of a mailed rider, and Bronn plunged </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">through the clansmen like a whirlwind, cutting down foes right and left. Ser Rodrik </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hammered at the big man in the shadowskin cloak, their horses dancing round each </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">other as they traded blow for blow. Jyck vaulted onto a horse and galloped bareback </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">into the fray. Tyrion saw an arrow sprout from the throat of the man in the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadowskin cloak. When he opened his mouth to scream, only blood came out. By </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="533" height="22" font="2">the time he fell, Ser Rodrik was fighting someone else. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Suddenly Marillion shrieked, covering his head with his woodharp as a horse </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leapt over their rock. Tyrion scrambled to his feet as the rider turned to come back </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at them, hefting a spiked maul. Tyrion swung his axe with both hands. The blade </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">caught the charging horse in the throat with a meaty  <i>thunk</i>,  angling upward, and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Tyrion almost lost his grip as the animal screamed and collapsed. He managed to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wrench the axe free and lurch clumsily out of the way. Marillion was less fortunate. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Horse and rider crashed to the ground in a tangle on top of the singer. Tyrion </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">danced back in while the brigand’s leg was still pinned beneath his fallen mount, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="666" height="22" font="2">and buried the axe in the man’s neck, just above the shoulder blades. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">As he struggled to yank the blade loose, he heard Marillion moaning under the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">bodies. “Someone help me,” the singer gasped. “Gods have mercy, I’m <i>bleeding</i>.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I believe that’s horse blood,” Tyrion said. The singer’s hand came crawling </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">out from beneath the dead animal, scrabbling in the dirt like a spider with five legs. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion put his heel on the grasping fingers and felt a satisfying crunch. “Close your </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eyes and pretend you’re dead,” he advised the singer before he hefted the axe and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">turned away. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">After that, things ran together. The dawn was full of shouts and screams and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">heavy with the scent of blood, and the world had turned to chaos. Arrows hissed </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">past his ear and clattered off the rocks. He saw Bronn unhorsed, fighting with a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sword in each hand. Tyrion kept on the fringes of the fight, sliding from rock to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rock and darting out of the shadows to hew at the legs of passing horses. He found a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wounded clansman and left him dead, helping himself to the man’s halfhelm. It fit </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">too snugly, but Tyrion was glad of any protection at all. Jyck was cut down from </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">behind while he sliced at a man in front of him, and later Tyrion stumbled over </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Kurleket’s  body. The pig face had been smashed in with a mace, but Tyrion </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">recognized the dirk as he plucked it from the man’s dead fingers. He was sliding it </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">through his belt when he heard a woman’s scream. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark was trapped against the stone face of the mountain with three </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">men around her, one still mounted and the other two on foot. She had a dagger </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">clutched awkwardly in her maimed hands, but her back was to the rock now and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they had penned her on three sides.  <i>Let them have the bitch</i>,  Tyrion thought,  <i>and </i></text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>welcome to her</i>, yet somehow he was moving. He caught the first man in the back </text>
</page>
<page number="267" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the knee before they even knew he was there, and the heavy axehead split flesh </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and bone like rotten wood.  <i>Logs that bleed</i>,  Tyrion thought inanely as the second </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">man came for him. Tyrion ducked under his sword, lashed out with the axe, the man </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">reeled backward. . . and Catelyn Stark stepped up behind him and opened his throat. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">The horseman remembered an urgent engagement elsewhere and galloped off </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">suddenly. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion looked around. The enemy were all vanquished or vanished. Somehow </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the fighting had ended when he wasn’t looking. Dying horses and wounded men lay </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">all around, screaming or moaning. To his vast astonishment, he was not one of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them. He opened his fingers and let the axe  <i>thunk</i>  to  the ground. His hands were </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sticky with blood. He could have sworn they had been fighting for half a day, but </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="444" height="22" font="2">the sun seemed scarcely to have moved at all. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your first battle?” Bronn asked later as he bent over Jyck’s body, pulling off </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his boots. They were good boots, as befit one of Lord Tywin’s men; heavy leather, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="579" height="22" font="2">oiled and supple, much finer than what Bronn was wearing. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion nodded. “My father will be <i>so</i> proud,” he said. His legs were cramping </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">so badly he could scarcely stand. Odd, he had never once noticed the pain during </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">the battle. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You need a woman now,” Bronn said with a glint in his black eyes. He </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shoved the boots into his saddlebag. “Nothing like a  woman after a man’s been </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">blooded, take my word.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Chiggen stopped looting the corpses of the brigands long enough to snort and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="123" height="22" font="2">lick his lips. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion glanced over to where Lady Stark was dressing Ser Rodrik’s wounds. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“I’m willing if she is,” he said. The freeriders broke into laughter, and Tyrion </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">grinned and thought, <i>There’s a start</i>. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Afterward he knelt by the stream and washed the blood off his face in water </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cold as ice. As he limped back to the others, he glanced again at the slain. The dead </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">clansmen were thin, ragged men, their horses scrawny and undersized, with every </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">rib showing. What weapons Bronn and Chiggen had left them were none too </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">impressive. Mauls, clubs, a  <i>scythe</i> . . . He remembered the big man in the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shadowskin cloak who had dueled Ser Rodrik with  a two-handed greatsword, but </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he found his corpse sprawled on the stony ground, the man was not so big </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">after all, the cloak was gone, and Tyrion saw that the blade was badly notched, its </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">cheap steel spotted with rust. Small wonder the clansmen had left nine bodies on the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="80" height="22" font="2">ground. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They had only three dead; two of Lord Bracken’s men-at-arms, Kurleket and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Mohor, and his own man Jyck, who had made such a bold show with his bareback </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">charge. <i>A fool to the end</i>, Tyrion thought. </text>
</page>
<page number="268" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lady Stark, I urge you to press on, with all haste,” Ser Willis Wode said, his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes scanning the ridgetops warily through the slit in his helm. “We drove them off </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">for the moment, but they will not have gone far.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We must bury our dead, Ser Willis,” she said. “These were brave men. I will </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="444" height="22" font="2">not leave them to the crows and shadowcats.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="500" height="22" font="2">“This soil is too stony for digging,” Ser Willis said. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="397" height="22" font="2">“Then we shall gather stones for cairns.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Gather all the stones you want,” Bronn told her, “but do it without me or </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Chiggen. I’ve better things to do than pile rocks on dead men. . . breathing, for </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one.” He looked over the rest of the survivors. “Any of you who hope to be alive </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">come nightfall, ride with us.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My lady, I fear he speaks the truth,” Ser Rodrik said wearily. The old knight </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had been wounded in the fight, a deep gash in his left arm and a spear thrust that </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">grazed his neck, and he sounded his age. “If we linger here, they will be on us again </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">for a certainty, and we may not live through a second attack.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion could see the anger in Catelyn’s face, but she had no choice. “May the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">gods forgive us, then. We will ride at once.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">There was no shortage of horses now. Tyrion moved his saddle to Jyck’s </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">spotted gelding, who looked strong enough to last another three or four days at </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">least. He was about to mount when Lharys stepped up and said, “I’ll take that dirk </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="132" height="22" font="2">now, dwarf.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Let him keep it.” Catelyn Stark looked down from her horse. “And see that </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="756" height="22" font="2">he has his axe back as well. We may have need of it if we are attacked again.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="541" height="22" font="2">“You have my thanks, lady,” Tyrion said, mounting up. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Save them,” she said curtly. “I trust you no more than I did before.” She was </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">gone before he could frame a reply. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion adjusted his stolen helm and took the axe from Bronn. He remembered </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">how he had begun the journey, with his wrists bound and a hood pulled down over </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his head, and decided that this was a definite improvement. Lady Stark could keep </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her trust; so long as he could keep the axe, he would count himself ahead in the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">game. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Willis Wode led them out. Bronn took the rear, with Lady Stark safely in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the middle, Ser Rodrik a shadow beside her. Marillion kept throwing sullen looks </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back at Tyrion as they rode. The singer had broken several ribs, his woodharp, and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">all four fingers on his playing hand, yet the day had not been an utter loss to him; </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">somewhere he had acquired a magnificent shadowskin cloak, thick black fur </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“What were you doing to that cat, boy?” Myrcella asked again, sternly. To her </text>

<text top="528" left="108" width="454" height="22" font="2">“A ragged dirty smelly boy,” Tommen agreed. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="4"><i>They don’t know me</i>, Arya realized.  <i>They don’t even know I’m a girl</i>.  Small </text>

<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">above her scabby knees. You don’t wear skirts and silks when you’re catching cats. </text>

<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You can’t keep this sort out,” one of the red cloaks said. “Like trying to keep </text>

<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Who do you belong to, boy?” the septa demanded. “Answer me. What’s </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya’s voice caught in her throat. If she answered, Tommen and Myrcella </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She heard shouts, then pounding footsteps, closing behind her. She dropped </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and rolled. The red cloak went careening past her, stumbling. Arya sprang back to </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">her feet. She saw a window above her, high and narrow, scarcely more than an </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">arrow slit. Arya leapt, caught the sill, pulled herself up. She held her breath as she </text>

<text top="418" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">The sounds grew more and more distant behind her. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Arya was out of breath and quite thoroughly lost. She was in for it now if they </text>

<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">water.  <i>Quiet as a shadow</i>,  she told herself. She wondered where she was. When </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they had first come to King’s Landing, she used to have bad dreams about getting </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lost in the castle. Father said the Red Keep was smaller than Winterfell, but in her </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dreams it had been immense, an endless stone maze with walls that seemed to shift </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and change behind her. She would find herself wandering down gloomy halls past </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">faded tapestries, descending endless circular stairs, darting through courtyards or </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over bridges, her shouts echoing unanswered. In some of the rooms the red stone </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">walls would seem to drip blood, and nowhere could she find a window. Sometimes </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she would hear her father’s voice, but always from a long way off, and no matter </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">how hard she ran after it, it would grow fainter and fainter, until it faded to nothing </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">and Arya was alone in the dark. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">It was very dark right now, she realized. She hugged her bare knees tight </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">against her chest and shivered. She would wait quietly and count to ten thousand. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="803" height="22" font="2">By then it would be safe for her to come creeping back out and find her way home. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By the time she had reached eighty-seven, the room had begun to lighten as </text>

<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Huge empty eyes stared at her hungrily through the gloom, and dimly she saw the </text>

<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her lip and sent the fear away. When she looked again, the monsters would be gone. </text>

<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">jaw. It  <i>felt</i>  real enough. The bone was smooth beneath her hand, cold and hard to </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the touch. She ran her fingers down a tooth, black and sharp, a dagger made of </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It’s dead,” she said aloud. “It’s just a skull, it can’t hurt me.” Yet somehow </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the monster seemed to know she was there. She could feel its empty eyes watching </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her through the gloom, and there was something in that dim, cavernous room that </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">did not love her. She edged away from the skull and backed into a second, larger </text>

<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wanted a bite of her flesh. Arya whirled, felt leather catch and tear as a huge fang </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nipped at her jerkin, and then she was running. Another skull loomed ahead, the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">biggest monster of all, but Arya did not even slow. She leapt over a ridge of black </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">teeth as tall as swords, dashed through hungry jaws, and threw herself against the </text>

<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her hands found a heavy iron ring set in the wood, and she yanked at it. The </text>

<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the wall, her hand skimming along the surface, taking small gliding steps through </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the darkness. <i>All halls lead somewhere. Where there is a way in, there is a way out. </i></text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>Fear cuts deeper than swords</i>.  Arya would not be afraid. It seemed as if she had </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">been walking a long ways when the wall ended abruptly and a draft of cold air blew </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="565" height="22" font="2">past her cheek. Loose hairs stirred faintly against her skin. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">From somewhere far below her, she heard noises. The scrape of boots, the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">distant sound of voices. A flickering light brushed the wall ever so faintly, and she </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">saw that she stood at the top of a great black well, a shaft twenty feet across </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">plunging deep into the earth. Huge stones had been set into the curving walls as </text>

<page number="274" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">steps, circling down and down, dark as the steps to hell that Old Nan used to tell </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them of. And  <i>something</i>  was coming up out of the darkness, out of the bowels of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">the earth. . .  </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Arya peered over the edge and felt the cold black breath on her face. Far </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">below, she saw the light of a single torch, small as the flame of a candle. Two men, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">she made out. Their shadows writhed against the sides of the well, tall as giants. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="478" height="22" font="2">She could hear their voices, echoing up the shaft. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“. . . found one bastard,” one said. “The rest will come soon. A day, two days, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">a fortnight. . .” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And when he learns the truth, what will he do?” a second voice asked in the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="316" height="22" font="2">liquid accents of the Free Cities. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The  gods alone know,” the first voice said. Arya could see a wisp of grey </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smoke drifting up off the torch, writhing like a snake as it rose. “The fools tried to </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">kill his son, and what’s worse, they made a mummer’s farce of it. He’s not a man to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">put that aside.  I warn you, the wolf and lion will soon be at each other’s throats, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">whether we will it or no.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Too soon, too soon,” the voice with the accent complained. “What good is </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">war <i>now</i>? We are not ready. Delay.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="565" height="22" font="2">“As well bid me stop time. Do you take me for a wizard?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The other chuckled. “No less.” Flames licked at the cold air. The tall shadows </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were almost on top of her. An instant later the man holding the torch climbed into </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her sight, his companion beside him. Arya crept back away from the well, dropped </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to her stomach, and flattened herself against the wall. She held her breath as the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="321" height="22" font="2">men reached the top of the steps. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“What would you have me do?” asked the torchbearer, a stout man in a leather </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">half cape. Even in heavy boots, his feet seemed to glide soundlessly over the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ground. A round scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed under his steel </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, and a dirk and shortsword at his belt. It </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="611" height="22" font="2">seemed to Arya there was something oddly familiar about him. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If one Hand can die, why not a second?” replied the man with the accent and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the forked yellow beard. “You have danced the dance before, my friend.” He was </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">no one Arya had ever seen before, she was certain of it. Grossly fat, yet he seemed </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to walk lightly, carrying his weight on the balls of his feet as a water dancer might. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">His rings glimmered in the torchlight, red-gold and pale silver, crusted with rubies, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">sapphires, slitted yellow tiger eyes. Every finger wore a ring; some had two. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Before is not now, and this Hand is not the other,” the scarred man said as </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they stepped out into the hall. <i>Still as stone</i>, Arya told herself, <i>quiet as a shadow</i>. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Blinded by the blaze of their own torch, they did not see her pressed flat against the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="275" height="22" font="2">stone, only a few feet away. </text>
</page>
<page number="275" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps so,” the forked beard replied, pausing to catch his breath after the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">long climb. “Nonetheless, we must have time. The princess is with child. The <i>khal</i> </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="814" height="22" font="2">will not bestir himself until his son is born. You know how they are, these savages.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The man with the torch pushed at something. Arya heard a deep rumbling. A </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">huge slab of rock, red in the torchlight, slid down out of the ceiling with a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">resounding crash that almost made her cry out. Where the entry to the well had been </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="418" height="22" font="2">was nothing but stone, solid and unbroken. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If he does not bestir himself soon, it may be too late,” the stout man in the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">steel cap said. “This is no longer a game for two players, if ever it was. Stannis </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Baratheon and Lysa Arryn have fled beyond my reach, and the whispers say they </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">are gathering swords around them. The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">urging his lord father to send his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that Robert should </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bed her, wed her, and make a new queen. Littlefinger. . . the gods only know what </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">game Littlefinger is playing. Yet Lord Stark’s the one who troubles my sleep. He </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">has the bastard, he has the book, and soon enough he’ll have the truth. And now his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wife has abducted Tyrion Lannister, thanks to Littlefinger’s meddling. Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">will take that for an outrage, and Jaime has a queer affection for the Imp. If the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lannisters move north, that will bring the Tullys in as well. <i>Delay</i>, you say. <i>Make </i></text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>haste</i>,  I reply. Even the finest of jugglers cannot keep a hundred balls in the air </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">forever.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You are more than a juggler, old friend. You are a true sorcerer. All I ask is </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">that you work your magic awhile longer.” They started down the hall in the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="569" height="22" font="2">direction Arya had come, past the room with the monsters. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What I can do, I will,” the one with the torch said softly. “I must have gold, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">and another fifty birds.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She let them get a long way ahead, then went creeping after them. <i>Quiet as a </i></text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="4"><i>shadow</i>. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So many?” The voices were fainter as the light dwindled ahead of her. “The </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ones you need are hard to find. . . so young, to know their letters. . . perhaps </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">older. . . not die so easy. . .” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="507" height="22" font="2">“No. The younger are safer. . . treat them gently. . .” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="333" height="22" font="2">“. . ..if they kept their tongues. . .” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="165" height="22" font="2">“. . . the risk. . .” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Long after their voices had faded away, Arya could still see the light of the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">torch, a smoking star that bid her follow. Twice it seemed to disappear, but she kept </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on straight, and both times she found herself at the top of steep, narrow stairs, the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">torch  glimmering far below her. She hurried after it, down and down. Once she </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">stumbled over a rock and fell against the wall, and her hand found raw earth </text>

<page number="276" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="700" height="22" font="2">supported by timbers, whereas before the tunnel had been dressed stone. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She must have crept after them for miles. Finally they were gone, but there </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was no place to go but forward. She found the wall again and followed, blind and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lost, pretending that Nymeria was padding along beside her in the darkness. At the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">end she was knee-deep in foul-smelling water, wishing she could dance upon it as </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Syrio might have, and wondering if she’d ever see light again. It was full dark when </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">finally Arya emerged into the night air. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She found herself standing at the mouth of a sewer where it emptied into the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">river. She stank so badly that she stripped right there, dropping her soiled clothing </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on the riverbank as she dove into the deep black waters. She swam until she felt </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">clean, and crawled out shivering. Some riders went past along the river road as </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Arya was washing her clothes, but if they saw the scrawny naked girl scrubbing her </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">rags in the moonlight, they took no notice. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She was miles from the castle, but from anywhere in King’s Landing you </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">needed only to look up to see the Red Keep high on Aegon’s Hill, so there was no </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">danger of losing her way. Her clothes were almost dry by the time she reached the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gatehouse. The portcullis was down and the gates barred, so she turned aside to a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">postern door. The gold cloaks who had the watch sneered when she told them to let </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her in. “Off with you,” one said. “The kitchen scraps are gone, and we’ll have no </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">begging after dark.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="412" height="22" font="2">“I’m not a beggar,” she said. “I live here.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="722" height="22" font="2">“I said, <i>off with you</i>. Do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="254" height="22" font="2">“I want to see my father.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The guards exchanged a glance. “I want to fuck the queen myself, for all the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">good it does me,” the younger one said. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="711" height="22" font="2">The older scowled. “Who’s this father of yours, boy, the city ratcatcher?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="391" height="22" font="2">“The Hand of the King,” Arya told him. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Both men laughed, but then the older one swung his fist at her, casually, as a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">man would swat a dog. Arya saw the blow coming even before it began. She danced </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back out of the way, untouched. “I’m not a boy,” she spat at them. “I’m Arya Stark </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of Winterfell, and if you lay a hand on me my lord father will have both your heads </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">on spikes. If you don’t believe me, fetch Jory Cassel or Vayon Poole from the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Tower of the Hand.” She put her hands on her hips. “Now are you going to open the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="594" height="22" font="2">gate, or do you need a clout on the ear to help your hearing?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her father was alone in the solar when Harwin and Fat Tom marched her in, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">an oil lamp glowing softly at his elbow. He was bent over the biggest book Arya </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">had ever seen, a great thick tome with cracked yellow pages of crabbed script, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bound between faded leather covers, but he closed it to listen to Harwin’s report. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="543" height="22" font="2">His face was stern as he sent the men away with thanks. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You realize I had half my guard out searching for you?” Eddard Stark said </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">when they were alone. “Septa Mordane is beside herself with fear. She’s in the sept </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">praying for your safe return. Arya, you <i>know</i> you are never to go beyond the castle </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I didn’t go out the gates,” she blurted. “Well, I didn’t mean to. I was down in </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the dungeons, only they turned into this tunnel. It was all dark, and I didn’t have a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">torch or a candle to see by, so I had to follow. I couldn’t go back the way I came on </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">account of the monsters. Father, they were talking about  <i>killing</i>  you! Not the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">monsters, the two men. They didn’t see me, I was being still as stone and quiet as a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadow, but I heard them. They said you had a book and a bastard and if one Hand </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">could die, why not a second? Is that the book? Jon’s the bastard, I bet.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="553" height="22" font="2">“Jon? Arya, what are you talking about? Who said this?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>They </i>did,” she told him. “There was a fat one with rings and a forked yellow </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">beard, and another in mail and a steel cap, and the fat one said they had to delay but </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the other one told him he couldn’t keep juggling and the wolf and the lion were </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">going to eat each other and it was a mummer’s farce.” She tried to remember the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rest. She hadn’t quite understood everything she’d heard, and now it was all mixed </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">up in her head. “The fat one said the princess was with child. The one in the steel </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="749" height="22" font="2">cap, he had the torch, he said that they had to hurry. I think he was a wizard.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A wizard,” said Ned, unsmiling. “Did he have a long white beard and tall </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="323" height="22" font="2">pointed hat speckled with stars?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No! It wasn’t like Old Nan’s stories. He didn’t <i>look</i> like a wizard, but the fat </text>

<text top="694" left="108" width="563" height="22" font="2">“I warn you, Arya, if you’re spinning this thread of air—” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No, I  <i>told</i>  you, it was in the dungeons, by the place with the secret wall. I </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="315" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Arya admitted, “only—” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Arya, they were mummers,” her father told her. “There must be a dozen </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="551" height="22" font="2">“No.” She shook her head stubbornly. “They weren’t—” </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Desmond  called out, opening the door a crack, “but there’s a black brother here </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="815" height="22" font="2">begging audience. He says the matter is urgent. I thought you would want to know.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="588" height="22" font="2">“My door is always open to the Night’s Watch,” Father said. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Desmond ushered the man inside. He was stooped and ugly, with an unkempt </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">beard and unwashed clothes, yet Father greeted him pleasantly and asked his name. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yoren, as it please m’lord. My pardons for the hour.” He bowed to Arya. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">“And this must be your son. He has your look.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I’m a <i>girl</i>,” Arya said, exasperated. If the old man was down from the Wall, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he must have come by way of Winterfell. “Do you know my brothers?” she asked </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">excitedly. “Robb and Bran are at Winterfell, and Jon’s on the Wall. Jon Snow, he’s </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the Night’s Watch too, you must know him, he has a direwolf, a white one with </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">red eyes. Is Jon a ranger yet? I’m Arya Stark.” The old man in his smelly black </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">clothes was looking at her oddly, but Arya could not seem to stop talking. “When </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you ride back to the Wall, would you bring Jon a letter if I wrote one?” She wished </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jon were here right now. <i>He’d</i> believe her about the dungeons and the fat man with </text>

<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“My daughter often forgets her courtesies,” Eddard Stark said with a faint </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">smile that softened his words. “I beg your forgiveness, Yoren. Did my brother </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">Benjen send you?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No one <i>sent</i>  me, m’lord, saving old Mormont. I’m here to find men for the </text>

<text top="804" left="108" width="140" height="22" font="2">“The others?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Yoren spat. “Sellswords and freeriders and like trash. That inn was full o’ </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them, and I saw them take the scent. The scent of blood or the scent of gold, they </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smell the same in the end. Not all o’ them made for King’s Landing, either. Some </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">went galloping for Casterly Rock, and the Rock lies closer. Lord Tywin will have </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">gotten the word by now, you can count on it.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="367" height="22" font="2">Father frowned. “What word is this?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Yoren eyed Arya. “One best spoken in private, m’lord, begging your </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">pardons.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“As you say. Desmond, see my daughter to her chambers.” He kissed her on </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="472" height="22" font="2">the brow. “We’ll finish our talk on the morrow.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya stood rooted to the spot. “Nothing bad’s happened to Jon, has it?” she </text>

<page number="279" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="333" height="22" font="2">asked Yoren. “Or Uncle Benjen?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Well, as to Stark, I can’t say. The Snow boy was well enough when I left the </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="740" height="22" font="2">Desmond took her hand. “Come along, milady. You heard your lord father.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Arya had no choice but to go with him, wishing it had been Fat Tom. With </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tom, she might have been able to linger at the door on some excuse and hear what </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Yoren was saying, but Desmond was too single-minded to trick. “How many guards </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">does my father have?” she asked him as they descended to her bedchamber. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="324" height="22" font="2">“Here at King’s Landing? Fifty.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="577" height="22" font="2">“You wouldn’t let anyone kill him, would you?” she asked. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Desmond laughed. “No fear on that count, little lady. Lord Eddard’s guarded </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">night and day. He’ll come to no harm.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="600" height="22" font="2">“The Lannisters have more than fifty men,” Arya pointed out. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“So  they do, but every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords, so </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="202" height="22" font="2">you can sleep easy.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="393" height="22" font="2">“What if a wizard was sent to kill him?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Well, as to that,” Desmond replied, drawing his longsword, “wizards die the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="480" height="22" font="2">same as other men, once you cut their heads off.” </text>

<text top="262" left="178" width="693" height="22" font="2">obert, I beg of you,” Ned pleaded, “hear what you are saying. You are </text>

<text top="318" left="232" width="640" height="22" font="2">“<i>The whore is pregnant!</i>” The king’s fist slammed down on the </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">council table loud as a thunderclap. “I warned you this would happen, Ned. Back in </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the barrowlands, I warned you, but you did not care to hear it. Well, you’ll hear it </text>

<text top="456" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The other councillors were all doing their best to pretend that they were </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">somewhere else. No doubt they were wiser than he was. Eddard Stark had seldom </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="684" height="22" font="2">felt quite so alone. “You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.” </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Then let it be on my head, so long as it is done. I am not so blind that I </text>

<text top="593" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“There is no axe,” Ned told his king. “Only the shadow of a shadow, twenty </text>

<text top="649" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>If?</i>” Varys asked softly, wringing powdered  hands together. “My lord, you </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="502" height="22" font="2">wrong me. Would I bring ties to king and council?” </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned looked at the eunuch coldly. “You would bring us the whisperings of a </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="815" height="22" font="2">traitor half a world away, my lord. Perhaps Mormont is wrong. Perhaps he is lying.” </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Jorah would not dare deceive me,” Varys said with a sly smile. “Rely on </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">it, my lord. The princess is with child.” </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“So you say. If you are wrong, we need not fear. If the girl miscarries, we </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">need not fear. If she births a daughter in place of a son, we need not fear. If the babe </text>

<text top="897" left="108" width="484" height="22" font="2">“But if it <i>is</i> a boy?” Robert insisted. “If he lives?” </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The narrow sea would still lie between us. I shall fear the Dothraki the day </text>

<text top="1063" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“This ‘dragonspawn’ is in his mother’s belly,” Ned said. “Even Aegon did no </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Gods!  </i>You are stubborn as an aurochs, Stark.” The king looked around the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">council table. “Have the rest of you mislaid your tongues? Will no one talk sense to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">this frozen-faced fool?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Varys gave the king an unctuous smile and laid a soft hand on Ned’s sleeve. “I </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">understand your qualms, Lord Eddard, truly I do. It gave me no joy to bring this </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grievous news to council. It is a terrible thing we contemplate, a <i>vile</i> thing. Yet we </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">who presume to rule must do vile things for the good of the realm, however much it </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">pains us.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly shrugged. “The matter seems simple enough to me. We ought to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have had Viserys and his sister killed years ago, but His Grace my brother made the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">mistake of listening to Jon Arryn.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,” Ned replied. “On the Trident, Ser </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert’s friends and mine. When they </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">cut his throat, but your brother said, ‘I will not kill a man for  loyalty, nor for </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fighting well,’ and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan’s wounds.” He gave </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="598" height="22" font="2">the king a long cool look. “Would that man were here today.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robert had shame enough to blush. “It was not the same,” he complained. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="466" height="22" font="2">“Ser Barristan was a knight of the Kingsguard.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Whereas Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl.” Ned knew he was pushing </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">this well past the point of wisdom, yet he could not keep silent. “Robert, I ask you, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of </text>

<text top="694" left="108" width="484" height="22" font="2">“To put an end to <i>Targaryens</i>!” the king growled. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace, I never knew you to fear Rhaegar.” Ned fought to keep the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">scorn out of his voice, and failed. “Have the years so unmanned you that you </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">tremble at the shadow of an unborn child?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robert purpled. “No more, Ned,” he warned, pointing. “Not another word. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">Have you forgotten who is king here?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="442" height="22" font="2">“No, Your Grace,” Ned replied. “Have you?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Enough!</i>” the king bellowed. “I am sick of talk. I’ll be done with this, or be </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="277" height="22" font="2">damned. What say you all?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="421" height="22" font="2">“She must be killed,” Lord Renly declared. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="566" height="22" font="2">“We have no choice,” murmured Varys. “Sadly, sadly. . .” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan Selmy raised his pale blue eyes from the table and said, “Your </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Grace, there is honor in facing an enemy on the battlefield, but none in killing him </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">in his mother’s womb. Forgive me, but I must stand with Lord Eddard.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat, a process that seemed to take some </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">weary. “Is it not wiser, even <i>kinder</i>, that Daenerys Targaryen should die now so that </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Kinder,” Varys said. “Oh, well and truly spoken, Grand Maester. It is so true. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Should the gods in their caprice grant Daenerys Targaryen a son, the realm must </text>

<text top="418" left="108" width="417" height="22" font="2">“<i>Kiss her?</i>” Ser Barristan repeated, aghast. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="310" height="22" font="2">“A steel kiss,” said Littlefinger. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert turned to face his Hand. “Well, there it is, Ned. You and Selmy stand </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">alone on this matter. The only question that remains is, who can we find to kill </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="58" height="22" font="2">her?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="608" height="22" font="2">“Mormont craves a royal pardon,” Lord Renly reminded them. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Desperately,” Varys said, “yet he craves life even more. By now, the princess </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">nears Vaes Dothrak, where it is death to draw a blade. If I told you what the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dothraki would do to the poor man who used one on a <i>khaleesi</i>, none of you would </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sleep tonight.” He stroked a powdered cheek. “Now, poison. . . the tears of Lys, let </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">us say. Khal Drogo need never know it was not a natural death.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle’s sleepy eyes flicked open. He squinted suspiciously at </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">the eunuch. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“Poison is a coward’s weapon,” the king complained. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned had heard enough. “You send hired knives to kill a fourteen-year-old girl </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and still quibble about honor?” He pushed back his chair and stood. “Do it yourself, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Robert. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. Look her in the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes before you kill her. See her tears, hear her last words. You owe her that much </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">at least.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Gods</i>,” the king swore, the word exploding out of him as if he could barely </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">contain his fury. “You mean it, damn you.” He reached for the flagon of wine at his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">elbow, found it empty, and flung it away to shatter against the wall. “I am out of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="584" height="22" font="2">wine and out of patience. Enough of this. Just have it done.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I will not be part of murder, Robert. Do as you will, but do not ask me to fix </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">my seal to it.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">For a moment Robert did not seem to understand what Ned was saying. </text>
</page>
<page number="283" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Defiance was not a dish he tasted often. Slowly his face changed as comprehension </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">came. His eyes narrowed and a flush crept up his neck past the velvet collar. He </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pointed an angry finger at Ned. “You are the King’s Hand, Lord Stark. You will do </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="512" height="22" font="2">as I command you, or I’ll find me a Hand who will.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I  wish him every success.” Ned unfastened the heavy clasp that clutched at </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the folds of his cloak, the ornate silver hand that was his badge of office. He laid it </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">on the table in front of the king, saddened by the memory of the man who had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pinned it on him, the friend he had loved. “I thought you a better man than this, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">Robert. I thought we had made a nobler king.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert’s face was purple. “<i>Out</i>,” he croaked, choking on his rage. “Out, damn </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you, I’m done with you. What are you waiting for? Go, run back to Winterfell. And </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">make certain I never look on your face again, or I swear, I’ll have your head on a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">spike!” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ned bowed, and turned on his heel without another word. He could feel </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert’s eyes on his back. As he strode from the council chambers, the discussion </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">resumed with scarcely a pause. “On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="374" height="22" font="2">Men,” Grand Maester Pycelle offered. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Do you have any idea how  <i>costly</i>  they are?” Littlefinger complained. “You </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and  that’s for a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="627" height="22" font="2">merchant. I don’t dare think what they might ask for a princess.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The closing of the door behind him silenced the voices. Ser Boros Blount was </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">stationed outside the chamber, wearing the long white cloak and armor of the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard. He gave Ned a quick, curious glance from the corner of his eye, but </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">asked no questions. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The day felt heavy and oppressive as he crossed the bailey back to the Tower </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the Hand. He could feel the threat of rain in the air. Ned would have welcomed </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it. It might have made him feel a trifle less unclean. When he reached his solar, he </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">summoned Vayon Poole. The steward came at once. “You sent for me, my lord </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">Hand?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Hand no longer,” Ned told him. “The king and I have quarreled. We shall be </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="240" height="22" font="2">returning to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I shall begin making arrangements at once, my lord. We will need a fortnight </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="358" height="22" font="2">to ready everything for the journey.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“We may not have a fortnight. We may not have a day. The king mentioned </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">something about seeing my head on a spike.” Ned frowned. He did not truly believe </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the king would harm him, not Robert. He was angry now, but once Ned was safely </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">out of sight, his rage would cool as it always did. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="773" height="22" font="4"><i>Always?  </i>Suddenly, uncomfortably, he found himself recalling Rhaegar </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Targaryen.  <i>Fifteen years dead, yet Robert hates him as much as ever</i>.  It was a </text>

<page number="284" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">disturbing notion. . . and there was the other matter, the business with Catelyn and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the dwarf that Yoren had warned him of last night. That would come to light soon, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as sure as sunrise, and with the king in such a black fury. . . Robert might not care a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fig for Tyrion Lannister, but it would touch on his pride, and there was no telling </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">what the queen might do. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“It might be safest if I went on ahead,” he told Poole. “I will take my </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">daughters and a few guardsmen. The rest of you can  follow when you are ready. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Inform Jory, but tell no one else, and do nothing until the girls and I have gone. The </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">castle is full of eyes and ears, and I would rather my plans were not known.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="290" height="22" font="2">“As you command, my lord.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">When he had gone, Eddard Stark went to the window and sat brooding. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Robert had left him no choice that he could see. He ought to thank him. It would be </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">good to return to Winterfell. He ought never have left. His sons were waiting there. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Perhaps he and Catelyn would make a new son together when he returned, they </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were not so old yet. And of late he had often found himself dreaming of snow, of </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">the deep quiet of the wolfswood at night. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">And yet, the thought of leaving angered him as well. So much was still </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">undone. Robert and his council of cravens and flatterers would beggar the realm if </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">left unchecked. . . or, worse, sell it to the Lannisters in payment of their loans. And </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the truth of Jon Arryn’s death still eluded him. Oh, he had found a few pieces, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">enough to convince him that Jon had indeed been murdered, but that was no more </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">than the spoor of an animal on the forest floor. He had not sighted the beast itself </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="617" height="22" font="2">yet, though he sensed it was there, lurking, hidden, treacherous. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It struck him suddenly that he might return to Winterfell by sea. Ned was no </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sailor, and ordinarily would have preferred the kingsroad, but if he took ship he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">could stop at Dragonstone and speak with Stannis Baratheon. Pycelle had sent a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raven off across the water, with a polite letter from Ned requesting Lord Stannis to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">return  to his seat on the small council. As yet, there had been no reply, but the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">silence only deepened his suspicions. Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">died for, he was certain of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">him on the ancient island fortress of House Targaryen. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>And when you have it, what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some </i></text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust</i>. Ned slid the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dagger that Catelyn had brought him out of the sheath on his belt. The Imp’s knife. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Why would the dwarf want Bran dead? To silence him, surely. Another secret, or </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">only a different strand of the same web? </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Could <i>Robert</i> be part of it? He would not have thought so, but once he would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not have thought Robert could command the murder of women and children either. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had tried to warn him.  <i>You knew the man</i>,  she had said.  <i>The king is a </i></text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">He summoned Vayon Poole again and sent him to the docks to make </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">inquiries, quietly but quickly. “Find me a fast ship with a skilled captain,” he told </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">the steward. “I care nothing for the size of its cabins or the quality of its </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="668" height="22" font="2">appointments, so long as it is swift and safe. I wish to leave at once.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Poole had no sooner taken his leave than Tomard announced a visitor. “Lord </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="275" height="22" font="2">Baelish to see you, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned was half-tempted to turn him away, but thought better of it. He was not </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="679" height="22" font="2">free yet; until he was, he must play their games. “Show him in, Tom.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lord Petyr sauntered into the solar as if nothing had gone amiss that morning. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">He wore a slashed velvet  doublet in cream-and-silver, a grey silk cloak trimmed </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">with black fox, and his customary mocking smile. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="749" height="22" font="2">Ned greeted him coldly. “Might I ask the reason for this visit, Lord Baelish?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I won’t detain you long, I’m on my way to dine with Lady Tanda. Lamprey </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">pie and roast suckling pig. She has some thought to wed me to her younger </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">daughter, so her table is always astonishing. If truth be told, I’d sooner marry the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="443" height="22" font="2">pig, but don’t tell her. I do love lamprey pie.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Don’t let me keep you from your eels, my lord,” Ned said with icy disdain. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">“At the moment, I cannot think of anyone whose company I desire less than yours.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I’m certain if you put your mind to it, you could come up with a few </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">names. Varys, say. Cersei. Or Robert. His Grace is most wroth with you. He went </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">on about you at some length after you took your leave of us this morning. The </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="714" height="22" font="2">words <i>insolence</i> and <i>ingratitude</i> came into it frequently, I seem to recall.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ned did not honor that with a reply. Nor did he offer his guest a seat, but </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger took one anyway. “After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">them not to hire the Faceless Men,” he continued blithely. “Instead Varys will </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">quietly let it be known that we’ll make a lord of whoever does in the Targaryen </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">girl.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="557" height="22" font="2">Ned was disgusted. “So now we grant titles to assassins.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger shrugged. “Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are expensive. If </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than you with all your talk of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">honor. <i>Let</i> some sellsword drunk on visions of lordship try to kill her. Likely he’ll </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">make a botch of it, and afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we’d sent a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="507" height="22" font="2">Faceless Man after her, she’d be as good as buried.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned. “You sit in council and talk of ugly women and steel kisses, and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">now you expect me to believe that you tried to protect the girl? How big a fool do </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="179" height="22" font="2">you take me for?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="660" height="22" font="2">“Well, quite an enormous one, actually,” said Littlefinger, laughing. </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“It’s not murder I find amusing, Lord Stark, it’s you. You rule like a man </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dancing on rotten ice. I daresay you will make a noble splash. I believe I heard the </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="475" height="22" font="2">“The first and last,” said Ned. “I’ve had my fill.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="530" height="22" font="2">“When do you mean to return to Winterfell, my lord?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="491" height="22" font="2">“As soon as I can. What concern is that of yours?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“None. . . but if perchance you’re still here come evenfall, I’d be pleased to </text>

<text top="235" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>
<text top="262" left="203" width="671" height="22" font="2">y lady, you should have sent word of your coming,” Ser Donnel </text>
<text top="290" left="203" width="671" height="22" font="2">Waynwood told her as their horses climbed the pass. “We would </text>
<text top="318" left="203" width="668" height="22" font="2">have sent an escort. The high road is not as safe as it once was, for a </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="2">party as small as yours.” </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We learned that to our sorrow, Ser Donnel,” Catelyn said. Sometimes she felt </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as though her heart had turned to stone; six brave men had died to bring her this far, </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and she could not even find it in her to weep for them. Even their names were </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fading. “The clansmen harried us day and night. We lost three men in the first </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">attack, and two more in the second, and Lannister’s serving man died of a fever </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">when his wounds festered. When we heard your men approaching, I thought us </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">doomed for certain.” They had drawn up for a last desperate fight, blades in hand </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and backs to the rock. The dwarf had been whetting the edge of his axe and making </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">some mordant jest when Bronn spotted the banner the riders carried before them, </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky-blue and white. Catelyn had never seen a </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">more welcome sight. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The clans have grown bolder since Lord Jon died,” Ser Donnel said. He was </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a stocky youth of twenty years, earnest and homely, with a wide nose and a shock </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of thick brown hair. “If it were up to  me, I would take a hundred men into the </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">mountains, root them out of their fastnesses, and teach them some sharp lessons, but </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your sister has forbidden it. She would not even permit her knights to fight in the </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Hand’s tourney. She wants all our swords kept close to home, to defend the </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Vale. . . against what, no one is certain. Shadows, some say.” He looked at her </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">anxiously, as if he had suddenly remembered who she was. “I hope I have not </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="479" height="22" font="2">spoken out of turn, my lady. I meant no offense.” </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Frank talk does not offend me, Ser Donnel.” Catelyn knew what her sister </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feared. <i>Not shadows, Lannisters</i>, she thought to herself, glancing back to where the </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">dwarf rode beside Bronn. The two of them had grown thick as thieves since </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Chiggen had died. The little man was more cunning than she liked. When they had </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">entered the mountains, he had been her captive, bound and helpless. What was he </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">now? Her captive still, yet he rode along with a dirk through his belt and an axe </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">strapped to his saddle, wearing the shadowskin cloak he’d won  dicing with the </text>

<page number="288" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">singer and the chainmail hauberk he’d taken off Chiggen’s corpse. Two score men </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">flanked the dwarf and the rest of her ragged band, knights and men-at-arms in </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">service to her sister Lysa and Jon Arryn’s young son, and yet Tyrion betrayed no </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hint of fear. <i>Could I be wrong?</i> Catelyn wondered, not for the first time. Could he </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">be innocent after all, of Bran and Jon Arryn and all the rest? And if he was, what </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">did that make her? Six men had died to bring him here. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Resolute, she pushed her doubts away. “When we reach your keep, I would </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">take it kindly if you could send for Maester Colemon at once. Ser Rodrik is feverish </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from his wounds.” More than once she had feared the gallant old knight would not </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">survive the journey. Toward the end he could scarcely sit his horse, and Bronn had </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">urged her to leave him to his fate, but Catelyn would not hear of it. They had tied </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him in the saddle instead, and she had commanded Marillion the singer to watch </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">over him. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Donnel hesitated before he answered. “The Lady Lysa has commanded </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the maester to remain at the Eyrie at all times, to care for Lord Robert,” he said. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“We have a septon at the gate who tends to our wounded. He can see to your man’s </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">hurts.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had more faith in a maester’s learning than a septon’s prayers. She </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was about to say as much when she saw the battlements ahead, long parapets built </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">into the very stone of the mountains on either side of them. Where the pass shrank </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">to a narrow defile scarce wide enough for four men to ride abreast, twin </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">watchtowers clung to the rocky slopes, joined by a covered bridge of weathered </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">grey stone that arched above the road. Silent faces watched from arrow slits in </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tower, battlements, and bridge. When they had climbed almost to the top, a knight </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rode out to meet them. His horse and his armor were grey, but his cloak was the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">rippling blue-and-red of Riverrun, and a shiny black fish, wrought in gold and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">obsidian, pinned its folds against his shoulder. “Who would pass the Bloody Gate?” </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">he called. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ser Donnel Waynwood, with the Lady Catelyn Stark and her companions,” </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">the young knight answered. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Knight of the Gate lifted his visor. “I thought the lady looked familiar. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">You are far from home, little Cat.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“And you, Uncle,” she said, smiling despite all she had been through. Hearing </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">that hoarse, smoky voice again took her back twenty years, to the days of her </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="108" height="22" font="2">childhood. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="411" height="22" font="2">“My home is at my back,” he said gruffly. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Your home is in my heart,” Catelyn told him. “Take off your helm. I would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">look on your face again.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The years have not improved it, I fear,” Brynden Tully said, but when he </text>
</page>
<page number="289" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lifted off the helm, Catelyn saw that he lied. His features were lined and weathered, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and time had stolen the auburn from his hair and left him only grey, but the smile </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was the same, and the bushy eyebrows fat as caterpillars, and the laughter in his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="512" height="22" font="2">deep blue eyes. “Did Lysa know you were coming?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“There was no time to send word ahead,” Catelyn told him. The others were </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="616" height="22" font="2">coming up behind her. “I fear we ride before the storm, Uncle.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“May we enter the Vale?” Ser Donnel asked. The Waynwoods were ever ones </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">for ceremony. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“In the name of Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale, True </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Warden of the East, I bid you enter freely, and charge you to keep his peace,” Ser </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">Brynden replied. “Come.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And so she rode behind him, beneath the shadow of the Bloody Gate where a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dozen armies had dashed themselves to pieces in the Age of Heroes. On the far side </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the stoneworks, the mountains opened up suddenly upon a vista of green fields, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blue sky, and snowcapped mountains that took her breath away. The Vale of Arryn </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">bathed in the morning light. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">It stretched before them to the misty cast, a tranquil land of rich black soil, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes that shone like mirrors in the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sun, protected on all sides by its sheltering peaks. Wheat and corn and barley grew </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">high in its fields, and even in Highgarden the pumpkins were no larger nor the fruit </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">any sweeter than here. They stood at the western end of the valley, where the high </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">road crested the last pass and began its winding descent to the bottomlands two </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">miles below. The Vale was narrow here, no more than a half day’s ride across, and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the northern mountains seemed so close that Catelyn could almost reach out and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">touch them. Looming over them all was the jagged peak called the Giant’s Lance, a </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mountain that even mountains looked up to, its head lost in icy mists three and a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">half miles above the valley floor. Over its massive western shoulder flowed the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ghost torrent of Alyssa’s Tears. Even from this distance, Catelyn could make out </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="527" height="22" font="2">the shining silver thread, bright against the dark stone. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">When her uncle saw that she had stopped, he moved his horse closer and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pointed. “It’s there, beside Alyssa’s Tears. All you can see from here is a flash of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="776" height="22" font="2">white every now and then, if you look hard and the sun hits the walls just right.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Seven towers</i>, Ned had told her,<i> like white daggers thrust into the belly of the </i></text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>sky, so high you can stand on the parapets and look down on the clouds</i>. “How long </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="186" height="22" font="2">a ride?” she asked. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We can be at the mountain by evenfall,” Uncle Brynden said, “but the climb </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">will take another day.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik Cassel spoke up from behind. “My lady,” he said, “I fear I can go </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">no farther today.” His face sagged beneath his ragged, newgrown whiskers, and he </text>
</page>
<page number="290" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">looked so weary Catelyn feared he might fall off his horse. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Nor should you,” she said. “You have done all I could have asked of you, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and a hundred times more. My uncle will see me the rest of the way to the Eyrie. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lannister must come with me, but there is no reason that you and the others should </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">not rest here and recover your strength.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“We should be honored to have them to guest,” Ser Donnel said with the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grave courtesy of the young. Beside Ser Rodrik, only Bronn, Ser Willis Wode, and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Marillion the singer remained of the party that had ridden with her from the inn by </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">the crossroads. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My lady,” Marillion said, riding forward. “I beg you allow me to accompany </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">you to the Eyrie, to see the end of the tale as I saw its beginnings.” The boy </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="759" height="22" font="2">sounded haggard, yet strangely determined; he had a fevered shine to his eyes. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had never asked the singer to ride with them; that choice he had made </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">himself, and how he had come to survive the journey when so many braver men lay </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dead and unburied behind them, she could never say. Yet here he was, with a scruff </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of beard that made him look almost a man. Perhaps she owed him something for </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="468" height="22" font="2">having come this far. “Very well,” she told him. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="376" height="22" font="2">“I’ll come as well,” Bronn announced. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She liked that less well. Without  Bronn she would never have reached the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Vale, she knew; the sellsword was as fierce a fighter as she had ever seen, and his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sword had helped cut them through to safety. Yet for all that, Catelyn misliked the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">man. Courage he had, and strength, but there was  no kindness in him, and little </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">loyalty. And she had seen him riding beside Lannister far too often, talking in low </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">voices and laughing at some private joke. She would have preferred to separate him </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from the dwarf here and now, but having agreed that Marillion might continue to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Eyrie, she could see no gracious way to deny that same right to Bronn. “As you </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="789" height="22" font="2">wish,” she said, although she noted that he had not actually asked her permission. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Willis Wode remained with Ser Rodrik, a soft-spoken septon fussing over </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their wounds. Their horses were left behind as well, poor ragged things. Ser Donnel </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">promised to send birds ahead to the Eyrie and the Gates of the Moon with the word </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of their coming. Fresh mounts were brought forth from the stables, surefooted </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mountain stock with shaggy coats, and within the hour they set forth once again. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Catelyn rode beside her uncle as they began the descent to the valley floor. Behind </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">came Bronn, Tyrion Lannister, Marillion, and six of Brynden’s men. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Not until they were a third of the way down the mountain path, well out of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">earshot of the others, did Brynden Tully turn to her and say, “So, child. Tell me </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="263" height="22" font="2">about this storm of yours.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I have not been a child in many years, Uncle,” Catelyn said, but she told him </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">nonetheless. It took longer than she would have believed to tell it all, Lysa’s letter </text>
</page>
<page number="291" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Bran’s fall, the assassin’s dagger and Littlefinger and her chance meeting with </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="378" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister in the crossroads inn. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Her uncle listened silently, heavy brows shadowing his eyes as his frown grew </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">deeper. Brynden Tully had always known how to listen. . . to anyone but her father. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He was Lord Hoster’s brother, younger by five years, but the two of them had been </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">at war as far back as Catelyn could remember. During one of their louder quarrels, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">when Catelyn was eight, Lord Hoster had called Brynden “the black goat of the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tully flock.” Laughing, Brynden had pointed out that the sigil of their house was a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">leaping trout, so he ought to be a black <i>fish</i> rather than a black goat, and from that </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="506" height="22" font="2">day forward he had taken it as his personal emblem. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The war had not ended until the day she and Lysa had been wed. It was at </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">their wedding feast that Brynden told his brother he was leaving Riverrun to serve </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lysa and her new husband, the Lord of the Eyrie. Lord Hoster had not spoken his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="713" height="22" font="2">brother’s name since, from what Edmure told her in his infrequent letters. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Nonetheless, during all those years of Catelyn’s girlhood, it had been Brynden </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the Blackfish to whom Lord Hoster’s children had run with their tears  and their </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">tales, when Father was too busy and Mother too ill. Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure. . . and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">yes, even Petyr Baelish, their father’s ward. . . he had listened to them all patiently, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as he listened now, laughing at their triumphs and sympathizing with their childish </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">misfortunes. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When she was done, her uncle remained silent for a long time, as his horse </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">negotiated the steep, rocky trail. “Your father must be told,” he said at last. “If the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Lannisters should march, Winterfell is remote and the Vale walled up behind its </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">mountains, but Riverrun lies right in their path.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’d had the same fear,” Catelyn admitted. “I shall ask Maester Colemon to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">send a bird when we reach the Eyrie.” She had other messages to send as well; the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commands that Ned had given her for his bannermen, to ready the defenses of the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="487" height="22" font="2">north. “What is the mood in the Vale?” she asked. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Angry,” Brynden Tully admitted. “Lord Jon was much loved, and the insult </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was keenly felt when the king named Jaime Lannister to an office the Arryns had </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">held for near three hundred years. Lysa has commanded us to call her son the <i>True</i> </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Warden of the East, but no one is fooled. Nor is your sister alone in wondering at </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the manner of the Hand’s death. None dare say Jon was murdered, not openly, but </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">suspicion casts a long shadow.” He gave Catelyn a look, his mouth tight. “And </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="170" height="22" font="2">there is the boy.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The boy? What of him?” She ducked her head as they passed under a low </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="414" height="22" font="2">overhang of rock, and around a sharp turn. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Her uncle’s voice was troubled. “Lord Robert,” he sighed. “Six years old, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sickly, and prone to weep if you take his dolls away. Jon Arryn’s trueborn heir, by </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">all the gods, yet there are some who say he is too weak to sit his father’s seat, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Nestor Royce has been high steward these past fourteen years, while Lord Jon </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">served in King’s Landing, and many whisper that he should rule until the boy </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">comes of age. Others believe that Lysa must marry again, and soon. Already the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="657" height="22" font="2">suitors gather like crows on a battlefield. The Eyrie is full of them.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I might have expected that,” Catelyn said. Small wonder there; Lysa was still </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">young, and the kingdom of Mountain and Vale made a handsome wedding gift. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">“Will Lysa take another husband?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“She says yes, provided she finds a man who suits her,” Brynden Tully said, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“but she has already rejected  Lord Nestor and a dozen other suitable men. She </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">swears that this time <i>she</i> will choose her lord husband.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="468" height="22" font="2">“You of all people can scarce fault her for that.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Brynden snorted. “Nor do I, but. . . it seems to me Lysa is only playing at </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">courtship. She enjoys the sport, but I believe your sister intends to rule herself until </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">her boy is old enough to be Lord of the Eyrie in truth as well as name.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="526" height="22" font="2">“A woman can rule as wisely as a man,” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The  <i>right</i>  woman can,” her uncle said with a sideways glance. “Make no </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mistake, Cat. Lysa is not you.” He hesitated a moment. “If truth be told, I fear you </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="528" height="22" font="2">may not find your sister as helpful as you would like.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="392" height="22" font="2">She was puzzled. “What do you mean?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Lysa who came back from King’s Landing is not the same girl who went </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">south when her husband was named Hand. Those years were hard for her. You must </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">know. Lord Arryn was a dutiful husband, but their marriage was made from </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="214" height="22" font="2">politics, not passion.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="187" height="22" font="2">“As was my own.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They began the same, but your ending has been happier than your sister’s. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Two babes stillborn, twice as many miscarriages, Lord Arryn’s death. . . Catelyn, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the gods gave Lysa only the one child, and he is all your sister lives for now, poor </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">boy. Small wonder she fled rather than see him handed over to the Lannisters. Your </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sister is  <i>afraid</i>,  child, and the Lannisters are what she fears most. She ran to the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Vale, stealing away from the Red Keep like a thief in the night, and all to snatch her </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">son out of the lion’s mouth. . . and now you have brought the lion to her door.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“In chains,” Catelyn said. A crevasse yawned on her right, falling away into </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="779" height="22" font="2">darkness. She reined up her horse and picked her way along step by careful step. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Oh?” Her uncle glanced back, to where Tyrion Lannister was making his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">slow descent behind them. “I see an axe on his saddle, a dirk at his belt, and a </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sellsword that trails after him like a hungry shadow. Where are the chains, sweet </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="62" height="22" font="2">one?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn shifted uneasily in her seat. “The dwarf is here, and not by choice. </text>
</page>
<page number="293" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Chains or no, he is my prisoner. Lysa will want him to answer for his crimes no less </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">than I. It was her own lord husband the Lannisters murdered, and her own letter that </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">first warned us against them.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Brynden Blackfish gave her a weary smile. “I hope you are right, child,” he </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">sighed, in tones that said she was wrong. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The sun was well to the west by the time the slope began to flatten beneath the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hooves of their horses. The road widened and grew straight, and for the first time </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Catelyn noticed wildflowers and grasses growing. Once they reached the valley </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">floor, the going was faster and they made good time, cantering through verdant </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">greenwoods and sleepy little hamlets, past orchards and golden wheat fields, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">splashing across a dozen sunlit streams. Her uncle sent a standard-bearer ahead of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them, a double banner flying from his staff; the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on high, and below it his own black fish. Farm wagons and merchants’ carts and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="534" height="22" font="2">riders from lesser houses moved aside to let them pass. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Even so, it was full dark before they reached the stout castle that stood at the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">foot of the Giant’s Lance. Torches flickered atop its ramparts, and the horned moon </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">danced upon the dark waters of its moat. The drawbridge was up and the portcullis </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">down, but Catelyn saw lights burning in the gatehouse  and spilling from the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="375" height="22" font="2">windows of the square towers beyond. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">“The Gates of the Moon,” her uncle said as the party drew rein. His standard-</text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bearer rode to the edge of the moat to hail the men in the gatehouse. “Lord Nestor’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="418" height="22" font="2">seat. He should be expecting us. Look up.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn raised her eyes, up and up and up. At first all she saw was stone and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">trees, the looming mass of the great mountain shrouded in night, as black as a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">starless sky. Then she noticed the glow of distant fires well above them; a tower </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">keep, built upon the steep side of the mountain, its lights like orange eyes staring </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down from above. Above that was another, higher and more distant, and still higher </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a third, no more than a flickering spark in the sky. And finally, up where the falcons </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">soared, a  flash of white in the moonlight. Vertigo washed over her as she stared </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">upward at the pale towers, so far above. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="475" height="22" font="2">“The Eyrie,” she heard Marillion murmur, awed. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The sharp voice of Tyrion Lannister broke in. “The Arryns must not be </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">overfond of company. If you’re planning to make us climb that mountain in the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="330" height="22" font="2">dark, I’d rather you kill me here.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We’ll spend the night here and make the ascent on the morrow,” Brynden </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">told him. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I can scarcely wait,” the dwarf replied. “How do we get up there? I’ve no </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="270" height="22" font="2">experience at riding goats.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="317" height="22" font="2">“Mules,” Brynden said, smiling. </text>
</page>
<page number="294" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“There are steps carved into the mountain,” Catelyn said. Ned had told her </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="806" height="22" font="2">about them when he talked of his youth here with Robert Baratheon and Jon Arryn. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her uncle nodded. “It is too dark to see them, but the steps are there. Too </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">steep and narrow for horses, but mules can manage them most of the way. The path </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is guarded by three waycastles, Stone and Snow and Sky. The mules will take us as </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">far up as Sky.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="589" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister glanced up doubtfully. “And beyond that?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Brynden smiled. “Beyond that, the path is too steep even for mules. We </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ascend on foot the rest of the way. Or perchance you’d prefer to ride a basket. The </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Eyrie clings to the mountain directly above Sky, and in its cellars are six great </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">winches  with long iron chains to draw supplies up from below. If you prefer, my </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lord of Lannister, I can arrange for you to ride up with the bread and beer and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">apples.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The dwarf gave a bark of laughter. “Would that I were a pumpkin,” he said. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“Alas, my lord father would no doubt be most chagrined if his son of Lannister </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">went to his fate like a load of turnips. If you ascend on foot, I fear I must do the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">same. We Lannisters do have a certain pride.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Pride?” Catelyn snapped. His mocking tone and easy manner made her </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">angry. “Arrogance, some might call it. Arrogance and avarice and lust for power.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My brother is undoubtedly arrogant,” Tyrion Lannister replied. “My father is </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the soul of avarice, and my sweet sister Cersei lusts for power with every waking </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">breath. I, however, am innocent as a little lamb. Shall I bleat for you?” He grinned. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The drawbridge came creaking down before she could reply, and they heard </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the sound of oiled chains as the portcullis was drawn up. Men-at-arms carried </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">burning brands out to light their way, and her uncle led them across the moat. Lord </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Nestor Royce, High Steward of the Vale and Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, was </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">waiting in the yard to greet them, surrounded by his knights. “Lady Stark,” he said, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="709" height="22" font="2">bowing. He was a massive, barrel-chested man, and his bow was clumsy. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn dismounted to stand before him. “Lord Nestor,” she said. She knew </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the man only by reputation; Bronze Yohn’s cousin, from a lesser branch of House </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Royce, yet still a formidable lord in his own right. “We have had a long and tiring </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">journey. I would beg the hospitality of your roof tonight, if I might.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My roof is yours, my lady,” Lord Nestor returned gruffly, “but your sister the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lady Lysa has sent down word from the Eyrie. She wishes to see you at once. The </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">rest of your party will be housed here and sent up at first light.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Her uncle swung off his horse. “What madness is this?” he said bluntly. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Brynden Tully had never been a man to blunt the edge of his words. “A night </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ascent, with the moon not even full? Even Lysa should know that’s an invitation to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="157" height="22" font="2">a broken neck.” </text>
</page>
<page number="295" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The mules know the way, Ser Brynden.” A wiry girl of seventeen or eighteen </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">years stepped up beside Lord Nestor. Her dark hair was cropped short and straight </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around her head, and she wore riding leathers and a light shirt of silvered ringmail. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">She bowed to Catelyn, more gracefully than her lord. “I promise you, my lady, no </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">harm will come to you. It would be my honor to take you up. I’ve made the dark </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">climb a hundred times. Mychel says my father must have been a goat.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">She sounded so cocky that Catelyn had to smile. “Do you have a name, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">child?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="507" height="22" font="2">“Mya Stone, if it please you, my lady,” the girl said. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It did not please her; it was an effort for Catelyn to keep the smile on her face. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>Stone</i> was a bastard’s name in the Vale, as <i>Snow</i> was in the north, and <i>Flowers</i> in </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Highgarden; in each of the Seven Kingdoms, custom had fashioned a surname for </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">children born with no names of their own. Catelyn had nothing against this girl, but </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">suddenly she could not help but think of Ned’s bastard on the Wall, and the thought </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="776" height="22" font="2">made her angry and guilty, both at once. She struggled to find words for a reply. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Nestor filled the silence. “Mya’s a clever girl, and if she vows she will </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">bring you safely to the Lady Lysa, I believe her. She has not failed me yet.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Then I put myself in your hands, Mya Stone,” Catelyn said. “Lord Nestor, I </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="489" height="22" font="2">charge you to keep a close guard on my prisoner.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“And I charge you to bring the prisoner a cup of wine and a nicely crisped </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">capon, before he dies of hunger,” Lannister said. “A girl would be pleasant as well, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="791" height="22" font="2">but I suppose that’s too much to ask of you.” The sellsword Bronn laughed aloud. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lord Nestor ignored the banter. “As you say, my lady, so it will be done.” </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Only then did he look at the dwarf. “See our lord of Lannister to a tower cell, and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="268" height="22" font="2">bring him meat and mead.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn took her leave of her uncle and the others as Tyrion Lannister was led </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">off, then followed the bastard girl through the castle. Two mules were waiting in the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">upper bailey, saddled and ready. Mya helped her mount one while a guardsman in a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sky-blue cloak opened the narrow postern gate. Beyond was dense forest of pine </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and spruce, and the mountain like a black wall, but the steps were there, chiseled </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">deep into the rock, ascending into the sky. “Some people find it easier if they close </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">their eyes,” Mya said as she led the mules through the gate into the dark wood. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“When they get frightened or dizzy, sometimes they hold on to the mule too tight. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">They don’t like that.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I was born a Tully and wed to a Stark,” Catelyn said. “I do not frighten </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">easily. Do you plan to light a torch?” The steps were black as pitch. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The girl made a face. “Torches just blind you. On a clear night like this, the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">moon and the stars are enough. Mychel says I have the eyes  of the owl.” She </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mounted and urged her mule up the first step. Catelyn’s animal followed of its own </text>
</page>
<page number="296" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">accord. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You mentioned Mychel before,” Catelyn said. The mules set the pace, slow </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">but steady. She was perfectly content with that. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Mychel’s my love,” Mya explained. “Mychel Redfort. He’s squire to Ser Lyn </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">Corbray. We’re to wed as soon as he becomes a knight, next year or the year after.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She sounded so like Sansa, so happy and innocent with her dreams. Catelyn </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smiled, but the smile was tinged with sadness. The Redforts were an old name in </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Vale, she knew, with the blood of the First Men in their veins. His love she </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">might be, but no Redfort would ever wed a bastard. His family would arrange a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">more suitable match for him, to a Corbray or a Waynwood or a Royce, or perhaps a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">daughter of some greater house outside the Vale. If Mychel Redfort laid with this </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">girl at all, it would be on the wrong side of the sheet. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The ascent was easier than Catelyn had dared hope. The trees pressed close, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leaning over the path to make a rustling green roof that shut out even the moon, so </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it seemed as though they were moving up a long black tunnel. But the mules were </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">surefooted and tireless, and Mya Stone did indeed seem blessed with night-eyes. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">They plodded upward, winding their way back and forth across the face of the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mountain as the steps twisted and turned. A thick layer of fallen needles carpeted </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the path, so the shoes of their mules made only the softest sound on the rock. The </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">quiet soothed her, and the gentle rocking motion set Catelyn to swaying in her </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="418" height="22" font="2">saddle. Before long she was fighting sleep. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Perhaps she did doze for a moment, for suddenly a massive ironbound gate </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was looming before them. “Stone,” Mya announced cheerily, dismounting. Iron </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spikes were set along the tops of formidable stone walls, and two fat round towers </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">overtopped the keep. The gate swung open at Mya’s shout. Inside, the portly knight </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">who commanded the waycastle greeted Mya by name and offered them skewers of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">charred meat and onions still hot from the spit. Catelyn had not realized how hungry </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she was. She ate standing in the yard, as stablehands moved their saddles to fresh </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">mules. The hot juices ran down her chin and dripped onto her cloak, but she was too </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">famished to care. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Then it was up onto a new mule and out again into the starlight. The second </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">part of the ascent seemed more treacherous to Catelyn. The trail was steeper, the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">steps more worn, and here and there littered with pebbles and broken stone. Mya </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">had to dismount a half-dozen times to move fallen rocks from their path. “You </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">don’t want your mule to break a leg up here,” she said. Catelyn was forced to agree. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She could feel the altitude more now. The trees were sparser up here, and the wind </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blew more vigorously, sharp gusts that tugged at her clothing and pushed her hair </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">into her eyes. From time to time the steps doubled back on themselves, and she </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could see Stone below them, and the Gates of the Moon farther down, its torches no </text>
</page>
<page number="297" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">brighter than candles. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Snow was smaller than Stone, a single fortified tower and a timber keep and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stable hidden behind a low wall of unmortared rock. Yet it nestled against the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Giant’s Lance in such a way as to command the entire stone stair above the lower </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">waycastle. An enemy intent on the Eyrie would have to fight his way from Stone </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">step by step, while rocks and arrows rained down from Snow above. The </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">commander, an anxious young knight with a pockmarked face, offered bread and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cheese and the chance to warm themselves before his fire, but Mya declined. “We </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">ought to keep going, my lady,” she said. “If it please you.” Catelyn nodded. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Again they were given fresh mules. Hers was white. Mya smiled when she </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw him. “Whitey’s a good one, my lady. Sure of foot, even on ice, but you need to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">be careful. He’ll kick if he doesn’t like you.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The white mule seemed to like Catelyn; there was no kicking, thank the gods. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">There was no ice either, and she was grateful for that as well. “My mother says that </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">hundreds of years ago, this was where the snow began,” Mya told her. “It was </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">always white above here, and the ice never melted.” She shrugged. “I can’t </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remember ever seeing snow this far down the mountain, but maybe it was that way </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">once, in the olden times.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>So young</i>, Catelyn thought, trying to remember if she had ever been like that. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">The girl had lived half her life in summer, and that was all she knew.  <i>Winter is </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>coming, child</i>, she wanted to tell her. The words were on her lips; she almost said </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="466" height="22" font="2">them. Perhaps she was becoming a Stark at last. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Above Snow, the wind was a living thing, howling around them like a wolf in </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the waste, then falling off to nothing as if to lure them into complacency. The stars </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seemed brighter up here, so close that she could almost touch them, and the horned </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moon was huge in the clear black sky. As they climbed, Catelyn found it was better </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to look up than down. The steps were cracked and broken from centuries of freeze </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and thaw and the tread of countless mules, and even in the dark the heights put her </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">heart in her throat. When they came to a high saddle between two spires of rock, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Mya dismounted. “It’s best to lead the mules over,” she said. “The wind can be a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">little scary here, my lady.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn climbed stiffly from the shadows and looked at the path ahead; twenty </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet long and close to three feet wide, but with a precipitous drop to either side. She </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">could hear the wind shrieking. Mya stepped lightly out, her mule following as </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">calmly as if they were crossing a bailey. It was her turn. Yet no sooner had she </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">taken her first step than fear caught Catelyn in its jaws. She could  <i>feel</i>  the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">emptiness, the vast black gulfs of air that yawned around her. She stopped, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">trembling, afraid to move. The wind screamed at her and wrenched at her cloak, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">trying to pull her over the edge. Catelyn edged her foot backward, the most timid of </text>
</page>
<page number="298" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">steps, but the mule was behind her, and she could not retreat. <i>I am going to die here</i>, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">she thought. She could feel cold sweat trickling down her back. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Lady Stark,” Mya called across the gulf. The girl sounded a thousand leagues </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">away. “Are you well?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Tully Stark swallowed what remained of her pride. “I. . . I cannot do </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">this, child,” she called out. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yes you can,” the bastard girl said. “I know you can. Look how wide the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="86" height="22" font="2">path is.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I don’t want to look.” The world seemed to be spinning around her, mountain </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and sky and mules, whirling like a child’s top. Catelyn closed her eyes to steady her </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="174" height="22" font="2">ragged breathing. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="587" height="22" font="2">“I’ll come back for you,” Mya said. “Don’t move, my lady.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Moving was about the last thing Catelyn was about to do. She listened to the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">skirling of the wind and the scuffling sound of leather on stone. Then Mya was </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there, taking her gently by the arm. “Keep your eyes closed if you like. Let go of </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the rope now, Whitey will take care of himself. Very good, my lady. I’ll lead you </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">over, it’s easy, you’ll see. Give me a step now. That’s it, move your foot, just slide </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">it forward. See. Now another. Easy. You could run across. Another one, go on. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Yes.” And so, foot by foot, step by step, the bastard girl led Catelyn across, blind </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">and trembling, while the white mule followed placidly behind them. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The waycastle called Sky was no more than a high, crescent-shaped wall of </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">unmortared stone raised against the side of the mountain, but even the topless </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">towers of Valyria could not have looked more beautiful to Catelyn Stark. Here at </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">last the snow crown began; Sky’s weathered stones were rimed with frost, and long </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">spears of ice hung from the slopes above. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dawn was breaking in the east as Mya Stone <i>hallooed</i> for the guards, and the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gates opened before them. Inside the walls there was only a series of ramps and a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">great tumble of boulders and stones of all sizes. No doubt it would be the easiest </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thing in the world to begin an avalanche from here. A mouth yawned in the rock </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">face in front of them. “The stables and barracks are in there,” Mya said. “The last </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">part is inside the mountain. It can be a little dark, but at least you’re out of the wind. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">This is as far as the mules can go. Past here, well, it’s a sort of chimney, more like a </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stone ladder than proper steps, but it’s not too bad. Another hour and we’ll be </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">there.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn looked up. Directly overhead, pale in the dawn light, she could see the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">foundations of the Eyrie. It could not be more than six hundred feet above them. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">From below it looked like a small white honeycomb. She remembered what her </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">uncle had said of baskets and winches. “The Lannisters may have their pride,” she </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">told Mya, “but the Tullys are born with better sense. I have ridden all day and the </text>
</page>
<page number="299" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">best part of a night. Tell them to lower a basket. I shall ride with the turnips.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">reached the Eyrie. A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">of Jon Arryn’s household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon, thin and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nervous, with too little hair and too much neck. “Lady Stark,” Ser Vardis said, “the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pleasure is as great as it is unanticipated.” Maester Colemon bobbed his head in </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">agreement. “Indeed it is, my lady, indeed it is. I have sent word to your sister. She </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="497" height="22" font="2">left orders to be awakened the instant you arrived.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I hope she had a good night’s rest,” Catelyn said with a certain bite in her </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">tone that seemed to go unnoticed. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The men escorted her from the winch room up a spiral stair. The Eyrie was a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">small castle by the standards of the great houses; seven slender white towers </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bunched as tightly as arrows in a quiver on a shoulder of the great mountain. It had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">no need of stables nor smithys nor kennels, but Ned said its granary was as large as </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell’s, and its towers could house five hundred men. Yet it seemed strangely </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="808" height="22" font="2">deserted to Catelyn as she passed through it, its pale stone halls echoing and empty. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Lysa was waiting alone in her solar, still clad in her bed robes. Her long </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">auburn hair tumbled unbound across bare white shoulders and down her back. A </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">maid stood behind her, brushing out the night’s tangles, but when Catelyn entered, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her sister rose to her feet, smiling. “Cat,” she said. “Oh, Cat, how good it is to see </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you. My sweet sister.” She ran across the chamber and wrapped her sister in her </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">arms. “How long it has been,” Lysa murmured against her. “Oh, how very very </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">long.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It had been five years, in truth; five cruel years, for Lysa. They had taken their </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">toll. Her sister was two years the younger, yet she looked older now. Shorter than </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Catelyn, Lysa had grown thick of body, pale and puffy of face. She had the blue </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes of the Tullys, but hers were pale and watery, never still. Her small mouth had </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">turned petulant. As Catelyn held her, she remembered the slender, high-breasted </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">girl who’d waited beside her that day in the sept at Riverrun. How lovely and full of </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hope she had been. All that remained of her sister’s beauty was the great fall of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="428" height="22" font="2">thick auburn hair that cascaded to her waist. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="443" height="22" font="2">“You look well,” Catelyn lied, “but. . . tired.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her sister broke the embrace. “Tired. Yes. Oh, yes.” She seemed to notice the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">others then; her maid, Maester Colemon, Ser Vardis. “Leave us,” she told them. “I </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="775" height="22" font="2">wish to speak to my sister alone.” She held Catelyn’s hand as they withdrew. . .  </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">. . . and dropped it the instant the door closed. Catelyn saw her face change. It </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was as if the sun had gone behind a cloud. “Have you taken leave of your <i>senses</i>?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lysa snapped at her. “To bring him <i>here</i>, without a word of permission, without so </text>

<page number="300" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">

<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>My  </i>quarrels?” Catelyn could scarce believe what she was hearing. A great </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fire burned in the hearth, but there was no trace of warmth in Lysa’s voice. “They </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were your quarrels first, sister. It was you who sent me that cursed letter, you who </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">wrote that the Lannisters had murdered your husband.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“To warn you, so you could stay away from them! I never meant to  <i>fight</i> </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="501" height="22" font="2">them! Gods, Cat, do you know what you’ve <i>done</i>?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Mother?” a small voice said. Lysa whirled, her heavy robe swirling around </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her. Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, stood in the doorway, clutching a ragged cloth </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">doll and looking at them with large eyes. He was a painfully thin child, small for his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">age and sickly all his days, and from time to time he trembled. The shaking </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="474" height="22" font="2">sickness, the maesters called it. “I heard voices.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Small wonder, Catelyn thought; Lysa had almost been shouting. Still, her </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">sister looked daggers at her. “This is your aunt Catelyn, baby. My sister, Lady </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">Stark. Do you remember?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The boy glanced at her blankly. “I think so,” he said, blinking, though he had </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="584" height="22" font="2">been less than a year old the last time Catelyn had seen him. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lysa seated herself near the fire and said, “Come to Mother, my sweet one.” </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">She straightened his bedclothes and fussed with his fine brown hair. “Isn’t he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">beautiful? And strong too, don’t you believe the things you hear. Jon knew.  <i>The </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>seed is strong</i>,  he told me. His last words. He kept saying Robert’s name, and he </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grabbed my arm so hard he left marks. <i>Tell them, the seed is strong</i>. His seed. He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Lysa,” Catelyn said, “if you’re right about the Lannisters, all the more reason </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">we must act quickly. We—” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Not in front of the  <i>baby</i>,” Lysa said. “He has a delicate temper, don’t you, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="123" height="22" font="2">sweet one?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The boy is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale,” Catelyn reminded </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="717" height="22" font="2">her, “and these are no times for delicacy. Ned thinks it may come to war.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Quiet!</i>” Lysa snapped at her. “You’re scaring the boy.” Little Robert took a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">quick peek over his shoulder at Catelyn and began to tremble. His doll fell to the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">rushes, and he pressed himself against his mother. “Don’t be afraid, my sweet </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">baby,” Lysa whispered. “Mother’s here, nothing will hurt you.” She opened her </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">robe and drew out a pale, heavy breast, tipped with red. The boy grabbed for it </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">eagerly, buried his face against her chest, and began to suck. Lysa stroked his hair. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn was at a loss for words. <i>Jon Arryn’s son</i>, she thought incredulously. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She remembered her own baby, three-year-old Rickon, half the age of this boy and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">five times as fierce. Small wonder the lords of the Vale were restive. For the first </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">time she understood why the king had tried to take the child away from his mother </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We’re safe here,” Lysa was saying. Whether to her or to the boy, Catelyn </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="132" height="22" font="2">was not sure. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Don’t be a fool,” Catelyn said, the anger rising in her. “No one is safe. If you </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="767" height="22" font="2">think hiding here will make the Lannisters forget you, you are sadly mistaken.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lysa covered her boy’s ear with her hand. “Even if they could bring an army </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">through the mountains and past the Bloody Gate, the Eyrie is impregnable. You saw </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn wanted to slap her. Uncle Brynden had tried to warn her, she realized. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">“No castle is impregnable.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“This one is,” Lysa insisted. “Everyone says so. The only thing is, what am I </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">to do with this Imp you have brought me?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Is he a bad man?” the Lord of the Eyrie asked, his mother’s breast popping </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">from his mouth, the nipple wet and red. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A very bad man,” Lysa told him as she covered herself, “but Mother won’t </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="285" height="22" font="2">let him harm my little baby.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="363" height="22" font="2">“Make him fly,” Robert said eagerly. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lysa stroked her son’s hair. “Perhaps we will,” she murmured. “Perhaps that </text>

<text top="290" left="135" width="737" height="22" font="2">tall, elegant woman who wore a feathered gown over skin as black as ink. </text>
<text top="318" left="135" width="737" height="22" font="2">By the hearth, Heward and a buxom wench were playing at forfeits. From </text>

<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">while the girl had been forced to unbutton her shift to the waist. Jory Cassel stood </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beside a rain-streaked window with a wry smile on his face, watching Heward turn </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">over tiles and enjoying the view. </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned paused at the foot of the stair and pulled on his gloves. “It’s time we took </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">our leave. My business here is done.” </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Heward  lurched to his feet, hurriedly gathering up his things. “As you will, </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="789" height="22" font="2">my lord,” Jory said. “I’ll help Wyl bring round the horses.” He strode to the door. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger took his time saying his farewells. He kissed the black woman’s </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hand, whispered some joke that made her laugh aloud, and sauntered over to Ned. </text>

<text top="704" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lord Baelish,” Ned interrupted, “you presume too much. I am not ungrateful </text>

<text top="814" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The direwolf must be a prickly beast,” said Littlefinger with a sharp twist of </text>

<text top="869" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A warm rain was pelting down from a starless black sky as they walked to the </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stables. Ned drew up the hood of his cloak. Jory brought out his horse. Young Wyl </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">came right behind him, leading Littlefinger’s mare with one hand while the other </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fumbled with his belt and the lacings of his trousers. A barefoot whore leaned out of </text>

<text top="1007" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Will we be going back to the castle now, my lord?” Jory asked. Ned nodded </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">pay good coin like everyone else.” Lord Petyr chuckled at his own wit. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned let him prattle on. After a time, he quieted and they rode in silence. The </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">streets of King’s Landing were dark and deserted. The rain had driven everyone </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">under their roofs. It beat down on Ned’s head, warm as blood and relentless as old </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">guilts. Fat drops of water ran down his face. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Robert will never keep to one bed,” Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Storm’s End. “I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale.” Ned had held </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the babe in his arms; he could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his sister, but </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">smiled. “Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man’s nature.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The girl had been so young Ned had not dared to ask her age. No doubt she’d </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">been a virgin; the better brothels could always find a virgin, if the purse was fat </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">enough. She had light red hair and a powdering of freckles across the bridge of her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nose, and when she slipped free a breast to give her nipple to the babe, he saw that </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her bosom was freckled as well. “I named her Barra,” she said as the child nursed. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">“She looks so like him, does she not, milord? She has his nose, and his hair. . .” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“She does.” Eddard Stark had touched the baby’s fine, dark hair. It flowed </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">through his fingers like black silk. Robert’s firstborn had had the same fine hair, he </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="168" height="22" font="2">seemed to recall. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Tell him that when you see him, milord, as it. . . as it please you. Tell him </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">how beautiful she is.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I will,” Ned had  promised her. That was his curse. Robert would swear </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">undying love and forget them before evenfall, but Ned Stark kept his vows. He </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thought of the promises he’d made Lyanna as she lay dying, and the price he’d paid </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">to keep them. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“And tell him I’ve not been  with no one else. I swear it, milord, by the old </text>

<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he’d come back. So you’ll tell him I’m waiting, won’t you? I don’t want no jewels </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="539" height="22" font="2">or nothing, just him. He was always good to me, truly.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Good to you</i>, Ned thought hollowly. “I will tell him, child, and I promise you, </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She had smiled then, a smile so tremulous and sweet that it cut the heart out of </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him. Riding through the rainy night, Ned saw Jon Snow’s face in front of him, so </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">like a younger version of his own. If the gods frowned so on bastards, he thought </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dully, why did they fill men with such lusts? “Lord Baelish, what do you know of </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="401" height="22" font="2">“Well, he has more than you, for a start.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="144" height="22" font="2">“How many?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger shrugged. Rivulets of moisture twisted down the back of his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">cloak. “Does it matter? If you bed enough women, some will give you presents, and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">His Grace has never been shy on that count. I know he’s acknowledged that boy at </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Storm’s End, the one he fathered the night Lord Stannis wed. He could hardly do </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">otherwise. The mother was a Florent, niece to the Lady Selyse, one of her </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">bedmaids. Renly says that Robert carried the girl upstairs during the feast, and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">broke in the wedding bed while Stannis and his bride were still dancing. Lord </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Stannis seemed to think that was a blot on the honor of his wife’s House, so when </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the boy was born, he shipped him off to Renly.” He gave Ned a sideways glance. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“I’ve also heard whispers that Robert got a pair  of twins on a serving wench at </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock, three years ago when he went west for Lord Tywin’s tourney. Cersei </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had the babes killed, and sold the mother to a passing slaver. Too much an affront </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="2">to Lannister pride, that close to home.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark grimaced. Ugly tales like that were told of every great lord in the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">realm. He could believe it of Cersei Lannister readily enough. . . but would the king </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stand by and let it happen? The Robert he had known would not have, but the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert he had known had never been so practiced at shutting his eyes to things he </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">did not wish to see. “Why would Jon Arryn take a sudden interest in the king’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">baseborn children?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The short man gave a sodden shrug. “He was the King’s Hand. Doubtless </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="521" height="22" font="2">Robert asked him to see that they were provided for.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned was soaked through to the bone, and his soul had grown cold. “It had to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">be more than that, or why kill him?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger shook the rain from his hair and laughed. “Now I see. Lord Arryn </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">learned that His Grace had filled the bellies of some whores and fishwives, and for </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that he had to be silenced. Small wonder. Allow a man like that to live, and next </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="487" height="22" font="2">he’s like to blurt out that the sun rises in the east.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">time in years, he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The rain was falling harder now, stinging the eyes and drumming against the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ground. Rivers of black water were running down the hill when Jory called out, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“<i>My lord</i>,” his voice hoarse with alarm. And in an instant, the street was full of </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">soldiers. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned glimpsed ringmail over leather, gauntlets and greaves, steel helms with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">golden lions on the crests. Their cloaks clung to their backs, sodden with rain. He </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had no time to count, but there were ten at least, a line of them, on foot, blocking </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the street, with longswords and iron-tipped spears. “<i>Behind!</i>” he heard Wyl cry, and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">when he turned his horse, there were more in back of them, cutting off their retreat. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="639" height="22" font="2">Jory’s sword came singing from its scabbard. “Make way or die!” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The wolves are howling,” their leader said. Ned could see rain running down </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">his face. “Such a small pack, though.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger walked his horse forward, step by careful step. “What is the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">meaning of this? This is the Hand of the King.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He <i>was</i> the Hand of the King.” The mud muffled the hooves of the blood bay </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stallion. The line parted before him. On a golden breastplate, the lion of Lannister </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="652" height="22" font="2">roared its defiance. “Now, if truth be told, I’m not sure what he is.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Lannister, this is madness,” Littlefinger said. “Let us pass. We are expected </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">back at the castle. What do you think you’re doing?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">“He knows what he’s doing,” Ned said calmly. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister smiled. “Quite true. I’m looking for my brother. You </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">remember my brother, don’t you, Lord Stark? He was with us at Winterfell. Fair-</text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="551" height="22" font="2">haired, mismatched eyes, sharp of tongue. A short man.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="360" height="22" font="2">“I remember him well,” Ned replied. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It would seem he has met some trouble on the road. My lord father is quite </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">vexed. You would not perchance have any notion of who might have wished my </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">brother ill, would you?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your brother has been taken at my command, to answer for his crimes,” Ned </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">Stark said. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="443" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger groaned in dismay. “My lords—” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Jaime ripped his longsword from its sheath and urged his stallion forward. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“Show me your steel, Lord Eddard. I’ll butcher you like Aerys if I must, but I’d </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">sooner you died with a blade in your hand.” He gave Littlefinger a cool, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">contemptuous glance. “Lord Baelish, I’d leave here in some haste if I did not care to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">get bloodstains on my costly clothing.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger did not need to be urged. “I will bring the City Watch,” he </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">promised Ned. The Lannister line parted to let him through, and closed behind him. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger put his heels to his mare and vanished around a corner. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned’s men had drawn their swords, but they were three against twenty. Eyes </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">watched from nearby windows and doors, but no one was about to intervene. His </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">party was mounted, the Lannisters on foot save for Jaime himself. A charge might </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">win them free, but it seemed to Eddard Stark that they had a surer, safer tactic. “Kill </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="760" height="22" font="2">me,” he warned the Kingslayer, “and Catelyn will most certainly slay Tyrion.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister poked at Ned’s chest with the gilded sword that had sipped </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the blood of the last of the Dragonkings. “Would she? The noble Catelyn Tully of </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Riverrun murder a hostage? I think. . . not.” He sighed. “But I am not willing to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chance my brother’s life on a woman’s honor.” Jaime slid the golden sword into its </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sheath. “So I suppose I’ll let you run back to Robert to tell him how I frightened </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you. I wonder if he’ll care.” Jaime pushed his wet hair back with his fingers and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wheeled his horse around. When he was beyond the line of swordsmen, he glanced </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">back at his captain. “Tregar, see that no harm comes to Lord Stark.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="217" height="22" font="2">“As you say, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">“Still. . . we wouldn’t want him to leave here  <i>entirely</i>  unchastened, so”—</text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">through the night and the rain, he glimpsed the white of Jaime’s smile—“kill his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">men.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” Ned Stark screamed, clawing for his sword. Jaime was already </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cantering off down the street as he heard Wyl shout. Men closed from both sides. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ned rode one down, cutting at phantoms in red cloaks who gave way before him. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Jory Cassel put his heels into his mount and charged. A steel-shod hoof caught a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Lannister guardsman in the face with a sickening  <i>crunch</i>.  A second man reeled </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">away and for an instant Jory was free. Wyl cursed as they pulled him off his dying </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">horse, swords slashing in the rain. Ned galloped to him, bringing his longsword </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down on Tregar’s helm. The jolt of impact made him grit his teeth. Tregar stumbled </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to his knees, his lion crest sheared in half, blood running down his face. Heward </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was hacking at the hands that had seized his bridle when a spear caught him in the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">belly. Suddenly Jory was back among them, a red rain flying from his sword. “<i>No!</i>” </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Ned shouted. “<i>Jory, away!</i>” Ned’s horse slipped under him and came crashing </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down in the mud. There was a moment of blinding pain and the taste of blood in his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">mouth. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He saw them cut the legs from Jory’s mount and drag him to the earth, swords </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rising and failing as they closed in around him. When Ned’s horse lurched back to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">its feet, he tried to rise, only to fall again, choking on his scream. He could see the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">splintered bone poking through his calf. It was the last thing he saw for a time. The </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">rain came down and down and down. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When he opened his eyes again, Lord Eddard Stark was alone with his dead. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">His horse moved closer, caught the rank scent of blood, and galloped away. Ned </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">began to drag himself through the mud, gritting his teeth at the agony in his leg. It </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">seemed to take years. Faces watched from candlelit windows, and people began to </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="554" height="22" font="2">emerge from alleys and doors, but no one moved to help. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger and the City Watch found him there in the street, cradling Jory </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">Cassel’s body in his arms. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Somewhere the gold cloaks found a litter, but the trip back to the castle was a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">blur of agony, and Ned lost consciousness more than once. He remembered seeing </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Red Keep looming ahead of him in the first grey light of dawn. The rain had </text>

<text top="731" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">shamed. The knight had replied that the king could well do with a bit of </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shame. . . yet he had done as she bid. It had taken much pleading, and all the pillow </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tricks Doreah had taught her, before Dany had been able to make Drogo relent and </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="534" height="22" font="2">allow Viserys to rejoin them at the head of the column. </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Where is the <i>city</i>?” she asked as they passed beneath the bronze arch. There </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">were no buildings to be seen, no people, only the grass and the road, lined with </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="789" height="22" font="2">ancient monuments from all the lands the Dothraki had sacked over the centuries. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“Ahead,” Ser Jorah answered. “Under the mountain.” </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Beyond the horse gate, plundered gods and stolen heroes loomed to either side </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of them. The forgotten deities of dead cities brandished their broken thunderbolts at </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the sky as Dany rode her silver past their feet. Stone kings looked down on her from </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">their thrones, their faces chipped and stained, even their names lost in the mists of </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">time. Lithe young maidens danced on marble plinths, draped only in flowers, or </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">poured air from shattered jars. Monsters  stood in the grass beside the road; black </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">iron dragons with jewels for eyes, roaring griffins, manticores with their barbed </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tails poised to strike, and other beasts she could not name. Some of the statues were </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">so lovely they took her breath away, others so misshapen and terrible that Dany </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could scarcely bear to look at them. Those, Ser Jorah said, had likely come from the </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So many,” she said as her silver stepped slowly onward, “and from so many </text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Viserys was less impressed. “The trash of dead cities,” he sneered. He was </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">careful to speak in the Common Tongue, which few Dothraki could understand, yet </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">even so Dany found herself glancing back at the men of her <i>khas</i>, to make certain </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he had not been overheard. He went on blithely. “All these savages know how to do </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">is steal the things better men have built. . . and kill.” He laughed. “They  <i>do</i>  know </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">how to kill. Otherwise I’d have no use for them at all.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They are my people now,” Dany said. “You should not call them savages, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">brother.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The dragon speaks as he likes,” Viserys said. . . in the Common Tongue. He </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">glanced over his shoulder at Aggo and Rakharo, riding behind them, and favored </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them with a mocking smile. “See, the savages lack the wit to understand the speech </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of civilized men.” A moss-eaten stone monolith loomed over the road, fifty feet tall. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Viserys gazed at it with boredom in his eyes. “How long must we linger amidst </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="679" height="22" font="2">these ruins before Drogo gives me my army? I grow tired of waiting.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="550" height="22" font="2">“The princess must be presented to the <i>doshkhaleen</i> . . .” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The crones, yes,” her brother interrupted, “and there’s to be some mummer’s </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">show of a prophecy for the whelp in her belly, you told me. What is that to me? I’m </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tired of eating horsemeat and I’m sick of the stink of these savages.” He sniffed at </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the wide, floppy sleeve of his tunic, where it was his custom to keep a sachet. It </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could not have helped much. The tunic was filthy. All the silk and heavy wools that </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">Viserys had worn out of Pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from sweat. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah Mormont said, “The Western Market will have food more to your </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">taste, Your Grace. The traders from the Free Cities come there to sell their wares. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">The <i>khal</i> will honor his promise in his own time.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He had better,” Viserys said grimly. “I was promised a crown, and I mean to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have it. The dragon is not mocked.” Spying an obscene likeness of a woman with </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="661" height="22" font="2">six breasts and a ferret’s head, he rode off to inspect it more closely. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany was relieved, yet no less anxious. “I pray that my sun-and-stars will not </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">keep him waiting too long,” she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The knight looked after Viserys doubtfully. “Your brother should have bided </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his time in Pentos. There is no place for him in a  <i>khalasar</i>.  Illyrio tried to warn </text>

<page number="310" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He will go as soon as he has his ten thousand. My lord husband promised a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="154" height="22" font="2">golden crown.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah grunted. “Yes,  <i>Khaleesi</i>,  but. . . the Dothraki look on these things </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">differently than we do in the west. I have told him as much, as Illyrio told him, but </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your brother does not listen. The horselords are no traders. Viserys thinks he sold </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you, and now he wants his price. Yet Khal Drogo would say he had you as a gift. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He will give Viserys a gift in return, yes. . . in his own time. You do not <i>demand</i> a </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">gift, not of a <i>khal</i>. You do not demand anything of a <i>khal</i>.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It is not right to make him wait.” Dany did not know why she was defending </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her brother, yet she was. “Viserys says he could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="338" height="22" font="2">ten thousand Dothraki screamers.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah snorted. “Viserys  could not sweep a stable with ten thousand </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">brooms.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain in his tone. “What. . . what if </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it were not Viserys?” she asked. “If it were someone else who led them? Someone </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="649" height="22" font="2">stronger? Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah’s face grew thoughtful as their horses trod together down the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">godsway. “When I first went into exile, I looked at the Dothraki and saw half-naked </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">barbarians, as wild as their horses. If you had asked me then, Princess, I should </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have told you that a thousand good knights would have no trouble putting to flight a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="336" height="22" font="2">hundred times as many Dothraki.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="257" height="22" font="2">“But if I asked you now?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Now,” the knight said, “I am less certain. They are better riders than any </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">are full as deadly. . . and there are so  <i>many</i>  of them, my lady. Your lord husband </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his <i>khalasar</i>.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="235" height="22" font="2">“Is that truly so many?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident,” Ser Jorah </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">admitted, “but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">for blood? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">when the arrows fall like rain?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="318" height="22" font="2">“Not long,” she said, “not well.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He nodded. “Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="633" height="22" font="2">but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle. . .” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="387" height="22" font="2">“Is he?” Dany asked. “A fool, I mean?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah  considered that for a moment. “Robert should have been born </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Dothraki,” he said at last. “Your  <i>khal</i>  would tell you that only a coward hides </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">behind stone walls instead of facing his enemy with a blade in hand. The Usurper </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">would agree. He is a strong man, brave. . . and rash enough to meet a Dothraki </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">horde in the open field. But the men around him, well, their pipers play a different </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">tune. His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark. . .” He spat. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="379" height="22" font="2">“You hate this Lord Stark,” Dany said. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He took from me all I loved, for the sake of a few lice-ridden poachers and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his precious honor,” Ser Jorah said bitterly. From his tone, she could tell the loss </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">still pained him. He changed the subject quickly. “There,” he announced, pointing. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">“Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo and his bloodriders led them through the great bazaar of the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Western Market, down the broad ways beyond. Dany followed close on her silver, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">staring at the strangeness about her. Vaes Dothrak was at once the largest city and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the smallest that she had ever known. She thought it must be ten times as large as </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Pentos, a vastness without walls or limits, its broad windswept streets paved in </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grass and mud and carpeted with wildflowers. In the Free Cities of the west, towers </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and manses  and hovels and bridges and shops and halls all crowded in on one </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">another, but Vaes Dothrak sprawled languorously, baking in the warm sun, ancient, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">arrogant, and empty. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Even the buildings were so queer to her eyes. She saw carved stone pavilions, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">manses of woven grass as large as castles, rickety wooden towers, stepped pyramids </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">faced with marble, log halls open to the sky. In place of walls, some palaces were </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="633" height="22" font="2">surrounded by thorny hedges. “None of them are alike,” she said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Your brother had part of the truth,” Ser Jorah admitted. “The Dothraki do not </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">build. A thousand years ago, to make a house, they would dig a hole in the earth </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and cover it with a woven grass roof. The buildings you see were made by slaves </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brought here from lands they’ve plundered, and they built each after the fashion of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">their own peoples.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Most of the halls, even the largest, seemed deserted. “Where are the people </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">who live here?” Dany asked. The bazaar had been full of running children and men </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shouting, but elsewhere she had seen only a few eunuchs going about their business. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Only the crones of the  <i>doshkhaleen</i>  dwell permanently in the sacred city, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them and their slaves and servants,” Ser Jorah replied, “yet Vaes Dothrak is large </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">enough to house every man of every  <i>khalasar</i>,  should all the  <i>khals</i>  return to the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Mother at once. The crones have prophesied that one day that will come to pass, </text>

<page number="312" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="619" height="22" font="2">and so Vaes Dothrak must be ready to embrace all its children.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo finally called a halt near the Eastern Market where the caravans </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from Yi Ti and Asshai and the Shadow Lands came to trade, with the Mother of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Mountains looming overhead. Dany smiled as she recalled Magister Illyrio’s slave </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">girl and her talk of a palace with two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver. The </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“palace” was a cavernous wooden feasting hall, its rough-hewn timbered walls </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rising forty feet, its roof sewn silk, a vast billowing tent that could be raised to keep </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">out the rare rains, or lowered to admit the endless sky. Around the hall were broad </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grassy horse yards fenced with high hedges, firepits, and hundreds of round earthen </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">houses that bulged from the ground like miniature hills, covered with grass. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A small army of slaves had gone ahead to prepare for Khal Drogo’s arrival. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">As each rider swung down from his saddle, he unbelted his <i>arakh</i> and handed it to a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">waiting slave, and any other weapons he carried as well. Even Khal Drogo himself </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was not exempt. Ser Jorah had explained that it was forbidden to carry a blade in </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Vaes Dothrak, or to shed a free man’s blood. Even warring <i>khalasars</i> put aside their </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feuds and shared meat and mead together when they were in sight of the Mother of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Mountains. In this place, the crones of the  <i>doshkhaleen</i>  had decreed, all Dothraki </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">were one blood, one <i>khalasar</i>, one herd. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Cohollo came to Dany as Irri and Jhiqui were helping her down off her silver. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He was the oldest of Drogo’s three bloodriders, a squat bald man with a crooked </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">nose and a mouth full of broken teeth, shattered by a mace twenty years before </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he saved the young  <i>khalakka</i>  from sellswords who hoped to sell him to his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father’s enemies. His life had been bound to Drogo’s the day her lord husband was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">born. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Every <i>khal</i> had his bloodriders. At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Dothraki Kingsguard, sworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more than a guard; they were the <i>khal</i>’s </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brothers, his shadows, his fiercest friends. “Blood of my blood,” Drogo called them, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and so it was; they shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">demanded that when the <i>khal</i> died, his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the night lands. If the <i>khal</i> died at the hands of some enemy, they lived only long </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">enough to avenge him, and then followed him joyfully into the grave. In some </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>khalasars</i>, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the <i>khal</i>’s wine, his tent, and even his </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="593" height="22" font="2">wives, though never his horses. A man’s mount was his own. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Daenerys was glad that Khal Drogo did not hold to those ancient ways. She </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">should not have liked being shared. And while old Cohollo treated her kindly </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">enough, the others frightened her; Haggo, huge and silent, often glowered as if he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had forgotten who she was, and Qotho had cruel eyes and quick hands that liked to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hurt. He left bruises on Doreah’s soft  white skin whenever he touched her, and </text>

<page number="313" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">sometimes made Irri sob in the night. Even his horses seemed to fear him. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Yet they were bound to Drogo for life and death, so Daenerys had no choice </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but to accept them. And sometimes she found herself wishing her father had been </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">protected by such men. In the songs, the white knights of the Kingsguard were ever </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">noble, valiant, and true, and yet King Aerys had been murdered by one of them, the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">handsome boy they now called the Kingslayer, and a second, Ser Barristan the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Bold, had gone over to the Usurper. She wondered if all men were as false in the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Seven Kingdoms. When her son sat the Iron Throne, she would see that he had </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="715" height="22" font="2">bloodriders of his own to protect him against treachery in his Kingsguard. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>,” Cohollo said to her, in Dothraki. “Drogo, who is blood of my </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blood, commands me to tell you that he must ascend the Mother of Mountains this </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">night, to sacrifice to the gods for his safe return.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Only men were allowed to set foot on the Mother, Dany knew. The  <i>khal</i>’s </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bloodriders would go with him, and return at dawn. “Tell my sun-and-stars that I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dream of him, and wait anxious for his return,” she replied, thankful. Dany tired </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">more easily as the child grew within her; in truth, a night of rest would be most </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">welcome. Her pregnancy only seemed to have inflamed Drogo’s desire for her, and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="380" height="22" font="2">of late his embraces left her exhausted. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Doreah led her to the hollow hill that had been prepared for her and her <i>khal</i>. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">It was cool and dim within, like a tent made of earth. “Jhiqui, a bath, please,” she </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commanded, to wash the dust of travel from her skin and soak her weary bones. It </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was pleasant to know that they would linger here for a while, that she would not </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">need to climb back on her silver on the morrow. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The water was scalding hot, as she liked it. “I will give my brother his gifts </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tonight,” she decided as Jhiqui was washing her hair. “He should look a king in the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sacred city. Doreah, run and find him and invite him to sup with me.” Viserys was </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">nicer to the Lysene girl than to her Dothraki handmaids, perhaps because Magister </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Illyrio had let him bed her back in Pentos. “Irri, go to the bazaar and buy fruit and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="313" height="22" font="2">meat. Anything but horseflesh.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">“Horse is best,” Irri said. “Horse makes a man strong.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="267" height="22" font="2">“Viserys hates horsemeat.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="236" height="22" font="2">“As you say, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">She brought back a haunch of goat and a basket of fruits and vegetables. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Jhiqui roasted the meat with sweetgrass and firepods, basting it with honey as it </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">cooked, and there were melons and pomegranates and plums and some queer </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">eastern fruit Dany did not know. While her handmaids prepared the meal, Dany laid </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">out the clothing she’d had made to her brother’s measure: a tunic and leggings of </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crisp white linen, leather sandals that laced up to the knee, a bronze medallion belt, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a leather vest painted with fire-breathing dragons. The Dothraki would respect him </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">more if he looked less a beggar, she hoped, and perhaps he would forgive her for </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shaming him that day in the grass. He was still her king, after all, and her brother. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">They were both blood of the dragon. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She was arranging the last of his gifts—a sandsilk cloak, green as grass, with a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pale grey border that would bring out the silver in his hair—when Viserys arrived, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dragging Doreah by the arm. Her eye was red where he’d hit her. “How dare you </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">send this whore to give me commands,” he said. He shoved the handmaid roughly </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="131" height="22" font="2">to the carpet. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The anger took Dany utterly by surprise. “I only wanted. . . Doreah, what did </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">you say?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>, pardons, forgive me. I went to him, as you bid, and told him you </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">commanded him to join you for supper.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No one commands the dragon,” Viserys snarled. “<i>I am your king!  </i>I should </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">have sent you back her head!” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Lysene girl quailed, but Dany calmed her with a touch. “Don’t be afraid, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he won’t hurt you. Sweet brother, please, forgive her, the girl misspoke herself, I </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">told her to <i>ask</i> you to sup with me, if it pleases Your Grace.” She took him by the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="619" height="22" font="2">hand and drew him across the room. “Look. These are for you.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="478" height="22" font="2">Viserys frowned suspiciously. “What is all this?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="564" height="22" font="2">“New raiment. I had it made for you.” Dany smiled shyly. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He looked at her and sneered. “Dothraki rags. Do you presume to dress me </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">now?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Please. . . you’ll be cooler and more comfortable, and I thought. . . maybe if </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you dressed like them, the Dothraki. . .” Dany did not know how to say it without </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">waking his dragon. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="356" height="22" font="2">“Next you’ll want to braid my hair.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’d never. . .”  Why was he always so cruel? She had only wanted to help. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="605" height="22" font="2">“You have no right to a braid, you have won no victories yet.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was the wrong thing to say. Fury shone from his lilac eyes, yet he dared not </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">strike her, not with her handmaids watching and the warriors of her  <i>khas</i>  outside. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Viserys picked up the cloak and sniffed at it. “This stinks of manure. Perhaps I shall </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">use it as a horse blanket.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I  had Doreah sew it specially for you,” she told him, wounded. “These are </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">garments fit for a <i>khal</i>.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I am the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, not some grass-stained savage with </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">bells in his hair,” Viserys spat back at her. He grabbed her arm. “You forget </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">yourself, slut. Do you think that big belly will protect you if you wake the dragon?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His fingers dug into her arm painfully and for an instant Dany felt like a child </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">again, quailing in the face of his rage. She reached out with her other hand and </text>

<page number="315" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grabbed the first thing she touched, the belt she’d hoped to give him, a heavy chain </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">of ornate bronze medallions. She swung it with all her strength. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It caught him full in the face. Viserys let go of her. Blood ran down his cheek </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">where the edge of one of the medallions had sliced it open. “You are the one who </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">forgets himself,” Dany said to him. “Didn’t you learn  <i>anything</i>  that day in the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">grass? Leave me now, before I summon my  <i>khas</i>  to drag you out. And pray that </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo does not hear of this, or he will cut open your belly and feed you your </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">own entrails.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Viserys scrambled back to his feet. “When I come into my kingdom, you will </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rue this day, slut.” He walked off, holding his torn face, leaving her gifts behind </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Drops of his blood had spattered the beautiful sandsilk cloak. Dany clutched </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">the soft cloth to her cheek and sat cross-legged on her sleeping mats. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="511" height="22" font="2">“Your supper is ready, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Jhiqui announced. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I’m not hungry,” Dany said sadly. She was suddenly very tired. “Share the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">food among yourselves, and send some to Ser Jorah, if you would.” After a moment </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="542" height="22" font="2">she added, “Please, bring me one of the dragon’s eggs.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Irri fetched the egg with the deep green shell, bronze flecks shining amid its </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">scales as she turned it in her small hands. Dany curled up on her side, pulling the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sandsilk cloak across her and cradling the egg in the hollow between her swollen </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">belly and small, tender breasts. She liked to hold them. They were so beautiful, and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sometimes just being close to them made her feel stronger, braver, as if somehow </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">she were drawing strength from the stone dragons locked inside. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt the child move within </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her. . . as if he were reaching out, brother to brother, blood to blood. “<i>You  </i>are the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dragon,” Dany whispered to him, “the <i>true</i> dragon. I know it. I know it.” And she </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">smiled, and went to sleep dreaming of home. </text>

<text top="290" left="133" width="741" height="22" font="2">they touched his skin like the gentlest of rains. He sat straight atop his </text>
<text top="318" left="133" width="737" height="22" font="2">horse, watching as the iron portcullis was winched upward. Try as he might </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">to keep calm, his heart was fluttering in his chest. </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="300" height="22" font="2">“Are you ready?” Robb asked. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Bran nodded, trying not to let his fear show. He had not been outside </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">Winterfell since his fall, but he was determined to ride out as proud as any knight. </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Let’s ride, then.” Robb put his heels into his big grey-and-white gelding, and </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="367" height="22" font="2">the horse walked under the portcullis. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Go,” Bran whispered to his own horse. He touched her neck lightly, and the </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">small chestnut filly started forward. Bran had named her Dancer. She was two years </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">old, and Joseth said she was smarter than any horse had a right to be. They had </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">trained her special, to respond to rein and voice and touch. Up to now, Bran had </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">only ridden her around the yard. At first Joseth or Hodor would lead her, while Bran </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sat strapped to her back in the oversize saddle the Imp had drawn up for him, but </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">for the past fortnight he had been riding her on his own, trotting her round and </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="443" height="22" font="2">round, and growing bolder with every circuit. </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">They passed beneath the gatehouse, over the drawbridge, through the outer </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">walls. Summer and Grey Wind came loping beside them, sniffing at the wind. Close </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">behind came Theon Greyjoy, with his longbow and a quiver of broadheads; he had </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a mind to take a deer, he had told them. He was followed by four guardsmen in </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mailed shirts and coifs, and Joseth, a stick-thin stableman whom Robb had named </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">master of horse while Hullen was away. Maester Luwin brought up the rear, riding </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">on a donkey. Bran would have liked it better if he and Robb had gone off alone, just </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the two of them, but Hal Mollen would not hear of it, and Maester Luwin backed </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him. If Bran fell off his horse or injured himself, the maester was determined to be </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grew colder. When the snow fell and the ice winds howled down out of the north, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Old Nan said, farmers left their frozen fields and distant holdfasts, loaded up their </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wagons, and then the winter town came alive. Bran had never seen it happen, but </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin said the day was looming closer. The end of the long summer was </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">near at hand. <i>Winter is coming</i>. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A few villagers eyed the direwolves anxiously as the riders went past, and one </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man dropped the wood he was carrying as he shrank away in fear, but most of the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">townfolk had grown used to the sight. They bent the knee when they saw the boys, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="482" height="22" font="2">and Robb greeted each of them with a lordly nod. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">With his legs unable to grip, the swaying motion of the horse made Bran feel </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">unsteady at first, but the huge saddle with its thick horn and high back cradled him </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">comfortingly, and the straps around his chest and thighs would not allow him to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fall. After a time the rhythm began to feel almost natural. His anxiety faded, and a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">tremulous smile crept across his face. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log, the local </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">alehouse. When Theon Greyjoy called out to them, the younger girl turned red and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">covered her face. Theon spurred his mount to move up beside Robb. “Sweet Kyra,” </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he said with a laugh. “She squirms like a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">street, and she blushes pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">and Bessa—” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Not where my brother can hear, Theon,” Robb warned him with a glance at </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">Bran. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy’s eyes on him. No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if the world </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to understand. Robb seemed to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">admire Theon and enjoy his company, but Bran had never warmed to his father’s </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">ward. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">Robb rode closer. “You are doing well, Bran.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="339" height="22" font="2">“I want to go faster,” Bran replied. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb smiled. “As you will.” He sent his gelding into a trot. The wolves raced </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">after him. Bran snapped the reins sharply, and Dancer picked up her pace. He heard </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="765" height="22" font="2">a shout from Theon Greyjoy, and the hoofbeats of the other horses behind him. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran’s cloak billowed out, rippling in the wind, and the snow seemed to rush </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">at his face. Robb was well ahead, glancing back over his shoulder from time to time </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">to make sure Bran and the others were following. He snapped the reins again. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Smooth as silk, Dancer slid into a gallop. The distance closed. By the time he </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">caught Robb on the edge of the wolfswood, two miles beyond the winter town, they </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had left the others well behind. “I can <i>ride</i>!” Bran shouted, grinning. It felt almost </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="175" height="22" font="2">as good as flying. </text>
</page>
<page number="318" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’d race you, but I fear you’d win.” Robb’s tone was light and joking, yet </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">Bran could tell that something was troubling his brother underneath the smile. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I don’t want to race.” Bran looked around for the direwolves. Both had </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">vanished into the wood. “Did you hear Summer howling last night?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Grey Wind was restless too,” Robb said. His auburn hair had grown shaggy </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and unkempt, and a reddish stubble covered his jaw, making him look older than his </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fifteen years. “Sometimes I think they know things. . . sense things. . .”  Robb </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">sighed. “I never know how much to tell you, Bran. I wish you were older.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’m eight now!” Bran said. “Eight isn’t so much younger than fifteen, and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">I’m the heir to Winterfell, after you.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So you are.” Robb sounded sad, and even a little scared. “Bran, I need to tell </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you something. There was a bird last night. From King’s Landing. Maester Luwin </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="110" height="22" font="2">woke me.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran felt a sudden dread. <i>Dark wings, dark words</i>, Old Nan always said, and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of late the messenger ravens had been proving the truth of the proverb. When Robb </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">wrote to the Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch, the bird that came back </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brought word that Uncle Benjen was still missing. Then a message had arrived from </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Eyrie, from Mother, but that had not been good news either. She did not say </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when she meant to return, only that she had taken the Imp as prisoner. Bran had sort </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of liked the little man, yet  the name  <i>Lannister</i>  sent cold fingers creeping up his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">spine. There was something about the Lannisters, something he ought to remember, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but when he tried to think what, he felt dizzy and his stomach clenched hard as a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stone. Robb spent most of that day locked behind closed doors with Maester Luwin, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy, and Hallis Mollen. Afterward, riders were sent out on fast horses, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">carrying Robb’s commands throughout the north. Bran heard talk of Moat Cailin, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the ancient stronghold the First Men had built at the top of the Neck. No one ever </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">told him what was happening, yet he knew it was not good. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And now another raven, another message. Bran clung to hope. “Was the bird </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="360" height="22" font="2">from Mother? Is she coming home?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The message was from Alyn in King’s Landing. Jory Cassel is dead. And </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Wyl and Heward as well. Murdered by the Kingslayer.” Robb lifted his face to the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="721" height="22" font="2">snow, and the flakes melted on his cheeks. “May the gods give them rest.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran did not know what to say. He felt as if he’d been punched. Jory had been </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">captain of the household guard at Winterfell since before Bran was born. “They </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">killed Jory?” He remembered all the times Jory had chased him over the roofs. He </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">could picture him striding across the yard in mail and plate, or sitting at his </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">accustomed place on the bench in the Great Hall, joking as he ate. “Why would </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="182" height="22" font="2">anyone kill Jory?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Robb shook his head numbly, the pain plain in his eyes. “I don’t know, </text>
</page>
<page number="319" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and. . . Bran, that’s not the worst of it. Father was caught beneath a falling horse in </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the fight. Alyn says his leg was shattered, and. . . Maester Pycelle has given him the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">milk of the poppy, but they aren’t sure when. . . when he. . .” The sound of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hoofbeats made him glance down the road, to where Theon and the others were </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">coming up. “When he will wake,” Robb finished. He laid his hand on the pommel </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of his sword then, and went on in the solemn voice of Robb the Lord. “Bran, I </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">promise you, whatever might happen, I will not let this be forgotten.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Something in his tone made Bran even more fearful. “What will you do?” he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">asked as Theon Greyjoy reined in beside them. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="509" height="22" font="2">“Theon thinks I should call the banners,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Blood for blood.” For once Greyjoy did not smile. His lean, dark face had a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">hungry look to it, and black hair fell down across his eyes. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Only the lord can call the banners,” Bran said as the snow drifted down </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">around them. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="664" height="22" font="2">“If your father dies,” Theon said, “Robb will be Lord of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="381" height="22" font="2">“He <i>won’t</i> die!” Bran screamed at him. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb took his hand. “He won’t die, not Father,” he said calmly. “Still. . . the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">honor of the north is in my hands now. When our lord father took his leave of us, he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="747" height="22" font="2">told me to be strong for you and for Rickon. I’m almost a man grown, Bran.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Bran shivered. “I wish Mother was back,” he said miserably. He looked </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">around for Maester Luwin; his donkey was visible in the far distance, trotting over a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="542" height="22" font="2">rise. “Does Maester Luwin say to call the banners too?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="516" height="22" font="2">“The maester is timid as an old woman,” said Theon. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Father always listened to his counsel,” Bran reminded his brother. “Mother </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">too.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="528" height="22" font="2">“I listen to him,” Robb insisted. “I listen to everyone.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The joy Bran had felt at the ride was gone, melted away like the snowflakes </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on his face. Not so long ago, the thought of Robb calling the banners and riding off </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to war would have filled him with excitement, but now he felt only dread. “Can we </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="360" height="22" font="2">go back now?” he asked. “I’m cold.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb glanced around. “We need to find the wolves. Can you stand to go a bit </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">longer?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I can go as long as you can.” Maester Luwin had warned him to keep the ride </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">short, for fear of saddle sores, but Bran would not admit to weakness in front of his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brother. He was sick of the way everyone was always fussing over him and asking </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">how he was. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Let’s hunt down the hunters, then,” Robb said. Side by side, they urged their </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mounts off the kingsroad and struck out into the wolfswood. Theon dropped back </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">and followed well behind them, talking and joking with the guardsmen. </text>
</page>
<page number="320" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was nice under the trees. Bran kept Dancer to a walk, holding the reins </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lightly and looking all around him as they went. He knew this wood, but he had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been so long confined to Winterfell that he felt as though he were seeing it for the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">first time. The smells filled his nostrils; the sharp fresh tang of pine needles, the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">earthy odor of wet rotting leaves, the hints of animal musk and  distant cooking </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fires. He caught a glimpse of a black squirrel moving through the snow-covered </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="751" height="22" font="2">branches of an oak, and paused to study the silvery web of an empress spider. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Theon and the others fell farther and farther behind, until Bran could no </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">longer hear their voices. From ahead came the faint sound of rushing waters. It </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="617" height="22" font="2">grew louder until they reached the stream. Tears stung his eyes. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="384" height="22" font="2">“Bran?” Robb asked. “What’s wrong?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran shook his head. “I was just remembering,” he said. “Jory brought us here </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="626" height="22" font="2">once, to fish for trout. You and me and Jon. Do you remember?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="484" height="22" font="2">“I remember,” Robb said, his voice quiet and sad. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I didn’t catch anything,” Bran said, “but Jon gave me his fish on the way </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="472" height="22" font="2">back to Winterfell. Will we ever see Jon again?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We saw Uncle Benjen when the king came to visit,” Robb pointed out. “Jon </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">will visit too, you’ll see.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The stream was running high and fast. Robb dismounted and led his gelding </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">across the ford. In the deepest part of the crossing, the water came up to midthigh. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">He tied his horse to a tree on the far side, and waded back across for Bran and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dancer. The current foamed around rock and root, and Bran could feel the spray on </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his face as Robb led him over. It made him smile. For a moment he felt strong </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">again, and whole. He looked up at the trees and dreamed of climbing them, right up </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="596" height="22" font="2">to the very top, with the whole forest spread out beneath him. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They were on the far side when they heard the howl, a long rising wail that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moved through the trees like a cold wind. Bran raised his head to listen. “Summer,” </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="674" height="22" font="2">he said. No sooner had he spoken than a second voice joined the first. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“They’ve made a kill,” Robb said as he remounted. “I’d best go and bring </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">them back. Wait here, Theon and the others should be along shortly.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="343" height="22" font="2">“I want to go with you,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I’ll find them faster by myself.” Robb spurred his gelding and vanished into </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">the trees. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Once he was gone, the woods seemed to close in around Bran. The snow was </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">falling more heavily now. Where it touched the ground it melted, but all about him </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">rock and root and branch wore a thin blanket of white. As he waited, he was </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">conscious of how uncomfortable he felt. He could not feel his legs, hanging useless </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the stirrups, but the strap around his chest was tight and chafing, and the melting </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">snow had soaked through his gloves to chill his hands. He wondered what was </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">keeping Theon and Maester Luwin and Joseth and the rest. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When he heard the rustle of leaves, Bran used the reins to make Dancer turn, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">expecting to see his friends, but the ragged men who stepped out onto the bank of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">the stream were strangers. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Good day to you,” he said nervously. One look, and Bran knew they were </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">neither foresters nor farmers. He was suddenly conscious of how richly he was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dressed. His surcoat was new, dark grey wool with silver buttons, and a heavy silver </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pin fastened his fur-trimmed cloak at the shoulders. His boots and gloves were lined </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="162" height="22" font="2">with fur as well. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“All alone, are you?” said the biggest of them, a bald man with a raw </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="497" height="22" font="2">windburnt face. “Lost in the wolfswood, poor lad.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I’m not lost.” Bran did not like the way the strangers were looking at him. He </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">counted four, but when he turned his head, he saw two others behind him. “My </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">brother rode off just a moment ago, and my guard will be here shortly.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Your guard, is it?” a second man said. Grey stubble covered his gaunt face. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“And what would they be guarding, my little lord? Is that a silver pin I see there on </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">your cloak?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Pretty,” said a woman’s voice. She scarcely looked like a woman; tall and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lean, with the same hard face as the others, her hair hidden beneath a bowl-shaped </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">halfhelm. The spear she held was eight feet of black oak, tipped in rusted steel. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="417" height="22" font="2">“Let’s have a look,” said the big bald man. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran watched him anxiously. The man’s clothes were filthy, fallen almost to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pieces, patched here with brown and here with blue and there with a dark green, and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">faded everywhere to grey, but once that cloak might have been black. The grey </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">stubbly man wore black rags too, he saw with a sudden start. Suddenly Bran </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">remembered the oathbreaker his father had beheaded, the day they had found the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wolf pups; that man had worn black as well, and Father said he had been a deserter </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from the Night’s Watch. <i>No man is more dangerous</i>, he remembered Lord Eddard </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saying. <i>The deserter knows his life is forfeit if he is taken, so he will not flinch from </i></text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="4"><i>any crime, no matter how vile or cruel. </i></text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">“The pin, lad,” the big man said. He held out his hand. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We’ll take the horse too,” said another of them, a woman shorter than Robb, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with a broad fiat face and lank yellow hair. “Get down, and be quick about it.” A </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="632" height="22" font="2">knife slid from her sleeve into her hand, its edge jagged as a saw. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="314" height="22" font="2">“No,” Bran blurted. “I can’t. . .” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The big man grabbed his reins before Bran could think to wheel Dancer </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around and gallop off. “You can, lordling. . . and will, if you know what’s good for </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">you.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stiv, look how he’s strapped on.” The tall woman pointed with her spear. </text>
</page>
<page number="322" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">“Might be it’s the truth he’s telling.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Straps, is it?” Stiv said. He drew a dagger from a sheath at his belt. “There’s </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">ways to deal with straps.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="516" height="22" font="2">“You some kind of cripple?” asked the short woman. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran flared. “I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell, and you better let go of my </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">horse, or I’ll see you all dead.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The gaunt man with the grey stubbled face laughed. “The boy’s a Stark, true </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">enough. Only a Stark would be fool enough to threaten where smarter men would </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">beg.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth,” suggested the short woman. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">“That should shut him up.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“You’re as stupid as you are ugly, Hali,” said the tall woman. “The boy’s </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">worth nothing dead, but alive. . . gods be damned, think what Mance would give to </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="430" height="22" font="2">have Benjen Stark’s own blood to hostage!” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Mance be damned,” the big man cursed. “You want to go back there, Osha? </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">More fool you. Think the white walkers will care if you have a hostage?” He turned </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">back to Bran and slashed at the strap around his thigh. The leather parted with a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="52" height="22" font="2">sigh. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The stroke had been quick and careless, biting deep. Looking down, Bran </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">glimpsed pale flesh where the wool of his leggings had parted.  Then the blood </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">began to flow. He watched the red stain spread, feeling light-headed, curiously </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">apart; there had been no pain, not even a hint of feeling. The big man grunted in </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="88" height="22" font="2">surprise. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Put down your steel now, and I promise you shall have a quick and painless </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">death,” Robb called out. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran looked up in desperate hope, and there he was. The strength of the words </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">were undercut by the way his voice cracked with strain. He was mounted, the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bloody carcass of an elk slung across the back of his horse, his sword in a gloved </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">hand. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="534" height="22" font="2">“The brother,” said the man with the grey stubbly face. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He’s a fierce one, he is,” mocked the short woman. Hali, they called her. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="289" height="22" font="2">“You mean to fight us, boy?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Don’t be a fool, lad. You’re one against six.” The tall woman, Osha, leveled </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her spear. “Off the horse, and throw down the sword. We’ll thank you kindly for the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="723" height="22" font="2">mount and for the venison, and you and your brother can be on your way.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robb whistled. They heard the faint sound of soft feet on wet leaves. The </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">undergrowth parted, low-hanging branches giving up their accumulation of snow, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Grey Wind and Summer emerged from the green. Summer sniffed the air and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">growled. </text>
</page>
<page number="323" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="233" height="22" font="2">“Wolves,” gasped Hali. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Direwolves,” Bran said. Still half-grown, they were as large as any wolf he </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had ever seen, but the differences were easy to spot, if you knew what to look for. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin and Farlen the kennelmaster had taught him. A direwolf had a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bigger head and longer legs in proportion to its body, and its snout and jaw were </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">markedly leaner and more pronounced. There was something gaunt and terrible </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">about them as they stood there amid the gently falling snow. Fresh blood spotted </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="212" height="22" font="2">Grey Wind’s muzzle. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Dogs,” the big bald man said contemptuously. “Yet I’m told there’s nothing </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">like a wolfskin cloak to warm a man by night.” He made a sharp gesture. “Take </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">them.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb shouted, “<i>Winterfell!</i>” and kicked his horse. The gelding plunged down </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the bank as the ragged men closed. A man with an axe rushed in, shouting and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">heedless. Robb’s sword caught him full in the face with a sickening crunch and a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">spray of bright blood. The man with the gaunt stubbly face made a grab for the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">reins, and for half a second he had them. . . and then Grey Wind was on him, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bearing him down. He fell back into the stream with a splash and a shout, flailing </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wildly with his knife as his head went under. The direwolf plunged in after him, and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="508" height="22" font="2">the white water turned red where they had vanished. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">Robb and Osha matched blows in midstream. Her long spear was a steel-</text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">headed serpent, flashing out at his chest, once, twice, three times, but Robb parried </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">every thrust with his longsword, turning the point aside. On the fourth or fifth </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thrust, the tall woman overextended herself and lost her balance, just for a second. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">Robb charged, riding her down. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A few feet away, Summer darted in and snapped at Hali. The knife bit at his </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">flank. Summer slid away, snarling, and came rushing in again. This time his jaws </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">closed around her calf. Holding the knife with both hands, the small woman stabbed </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">down, but the direwolf seemed  to sense the blade coming. He pulled free for an </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">instant, his mouth full of leather and cloth and bloody flesh. When Hali stumbled </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="782" height="22" font="2">and fell, he came at her again, slamming her backward, teeth tearing at her belly. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The sixth man ran from the carnage. . . but not far. As he went scrambling up </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the far side of the bank, Grey Wind emerged from the stream, dripping wet. He </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shook the water off and bounded after the running man, hamstringing him with a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">single snap of his teeth, and going for the throat as the screaming man slid back </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="232" height="22" font="2">down toward the water. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And then there was no one left but the big man, Stiv. He slashed at Bran’s </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">chest strap, grabbed his arm, and yanked. Suddenly Bran was falling. He sprawled </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on the ground, his legs tangled under him, one foot in the stream. He could not feel </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the cold of the water, but he felt the steel when Stiv pressed his dagger to his throat. </text>
</page>
<page number="324" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">“Back away,” the man warned, “or I’ll open the boy’s windpipe, I swear it.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb reined his horse in, breathing hard. The fury went out of his eyes, and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">his sword arm dropped. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">In that moment Bran saw everything. Summer was savaging Hali, pulling </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">glistening blue snakes from her belly. Her eyes were wide and staring. Bran could </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not tell whether she was alive or dead. The grey stubbly man and the one with the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">axe lay unmoving, but Osha was on her knees, crawling toward her fallen spear. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Grey Wind padded toward her, dripping wet. “Call him off!” the big man shouted. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="486" height="22" font="2">“Call them both off, or the cripple boy dies now!” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="409" height="22" font="2">“Grey Wind, Summer, to me,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The direwolves stopped, turned their heads. Grey Wind loped back to Robb. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Summer stayed where he was, his eyes on Bran and the man beside him. He </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">growled. His muzzle was wet and red, but his eyes burned. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Osha used the butt end of her spear to lever herself back to her feet. Blood </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">leaked from a wound on the upper arm where Robb had cut her. Bran could see </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sweat trickling down the big man’s face. Stiv was as scared as he was, he realized. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“Starks,” the man muttered, “bloody Starks.” He raised his voice. “Osha, kill the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">wolves and get his sword.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="723" height="22" font="2">“Kill them yourself,” she replied. “I’ll not be getting near those monsters.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">For a moment Stiv was at a loss. His hand trembled; Bran felt a trickle of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">blood where the knife pressed against his neck. The stench  of the man filled his </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="738" height="22" font="2">nose; he smelled of fear. “You,” he called out to Robb. “You have a name?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">“I am Robb Stark, the heir to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="228" height="22" font="2">“This is your brother?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="71" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="545" height="22" font="2">“You want him alive, you do what I say. Off the horse.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb hesitated a moment. Then, slowly and deliberately, he dismounted and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="289" height="22" font="2">stood with his sword in hand. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="227" height="22" font="2">“Now kill the wolves.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="197" height="22" font="2">Robb did not move. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="351" height="22" font="2">“You do it. The wolves or the boy.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” Bran screamed. If Robb did as they asked, Stiv would kill them both </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">anyway, once the direwolves were dead. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The bald man took hold of his hair with his free hand and twisted it cruelly, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">till Bran sobbed in pain. “You shut your mouth, cripple, you hear me?” He twisted </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">harder. “<i>You hear me?</i>” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A low <i>thrum</i> came from the woods behind them. Stiv gave a choked gasp as a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">half foot of razor-tipped broadhead suddenly exploded out of his chest. The arrow </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">was bright red, as if it had been painted in blood. </text>
</page>
<page number="325" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The dagger fell away from Bran’s throat. The big man swayed and collapsed, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">facedown in the stream. The arrow broke beneath him. Bran watched his life go </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">swirling off in the water. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Osha glanced around as Father’s guardsmen appeared from beneath the trees, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">steel in hand. She threw down her spear. “Mercy, m’lord,” she called to Robb. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The guardsmen had a strange, pale look to their faces as they took in the scene </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">of slaughter. They eyed the wolves uncertainly, and when Summer returned to </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Hali’s corpse to feed, Joseth dropped his knife and scrambled for the bush, heaving. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Even Maester Luwin seemed shocked as he stepped from behind a tree, but only for </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">an instant. Then he shook his head and waded across the stream to Bran’s side. “Are </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="108" height="22" font="2">you hurt?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="497" height="22" font="2">“He cut my leg,” Bran said, “but I couldn’t feel it.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">As the maester knelt to examine the wound, Bran turned his head. Theon </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Greyjoy stood beside a sentinel tree, his bow in hand. He was smiling. Ever </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smiling. A half-dozen arrows were thrust into the soft ground at his feet, but it had </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">taken only one. “A dead enemy is a thing of beauty,” he announced. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Jon always said you were an ass, Greyjoy,” Robb said loudly. “I ought to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="684" height="22" font="2">chain you up in the yard and let Bran take a few practice shots at <i>you</i>.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="582" height="22" font="2">“You should be thanking me for saving your brother’s life.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What if you had missed the shot?” Robb said. “What if you’d only wounded </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him? What if you had made his hand jump, or hit Bran instead? For all you knew, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the man might have been wearing a breastplate, all you could see was the back of </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his cloak. What would have happened to my brother then? Did you ever think of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="4"><i>that</i>, Greyjoy?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Theon’s smile was gone. He gave a sullen shrug and began to pull his arrows </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="285" height="22" font="2">from the ground, one by one. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb glared at his guardsmen. “Where were you?” he demanded of them. “I </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">was sure you were close behind us.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The men traded unhappy glances. “We were following, m’lord,” said Quent, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the youngest of them, his beard a soft brown fuzz. “Only first we waited for </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin and his ass, begging your pardons, and then, well, as it were. . .” He </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="562" height="22" font="2">glanced over at Theon and quickly looked away, abashed. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I spied a turkey,” Theon said, annoyed by the question. “How was I to know </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">that you’d leave the boy alone?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robb turned his head to look at Theon once more. Bran had never seen him so </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">angry, yet he said nothing. Finally he knelt beside Maester Luwin. “How badly is </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">my brother wounded?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No more than a scratch,” the maester said. He wet a cloth in the stream to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="705" height="22" font="2">clean the cut. “Two of them wear the black,” he told Robb as he worked. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb glanced over at where Stiv lay sprawled in the stream, his ragged black </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">cloak moving fitfully as the rushing waters tugged at it. “Deserters from the Night’s </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Watch,” he said grimly. “They must have been fools, to come so close to </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="728" height="22" font="2">“Folly and desperation are ofttimes hard to tell apart,” said Maester Luwin. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="434" height="22" font="2">“Shall we bury them, m’lord?” asked Quent. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“They would not have buried us,” Robb said. “Hack off their heads, we’ll </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="638" height="22" font="2">send them back to the Wall. Leave the rest for the carrion crows.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="509" height="22" font="2">“And this one?” Quent jerked a thumb toward Osha. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb walked over to her. She was a head taller than he was, but she dropped </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">to her knees at his approach. “Give me my life, m’lord of Stark, and I am yours.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="464" height="22" font="2">“Mine? What would I do with an oathbreaker?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I broke no oaths. Stiv and Wallen flew down off the Wall, not me. The black </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="314" height="22" font="2">crows got no place for women.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy sauntered closer. “Give her to the wolves,” he urged Robb. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The woman’s eyes went to what was left of Hali, and just as quickly away. She </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">shuddered. Even the guardsmen looked queasy. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="289" height="22" font="2">“She’s a woman,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A wildling,” Bran told him. “She said they should keep me alive so they </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">could take me to Mance Rayder.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="397" height="22" font="2">“Do you have a name?” Robb asked her. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="481" height="22" font="2">“Osha, as it please the lord,” she muttered sourly. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="571" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin stood. “We might do well to question her.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran could see the relief on his brother’s face. “As you say, Maester. Wayn, </text>

<text top="262" left="184" width="686" height="22" font="2">ou want eat?” Mord asked, glowering. He had a plate of oiled beans in </text>
<text top="290" left="184" width="293" height="22" font="2">one thick, stub-fingered hand. </text>
<text top="318" left="238" width="633" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister was starved, but he refused to let this brute see </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him cringe. “A leg of lamb would be pleasant,” he said, from the heap of soiled </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">straw in the corner of his cell. “Perhaps a dish of peas and onions, some fresh baked </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bread with butter, and a flagon of mulled wine to wash it down. Or beer, if that’s </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">easier. I try not to be overly particular.” </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="513" height="22" font="2">“Is beans,” Mord said. “Here.” He held out the plate. </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion sighed. The turnkey was twenty stone of gross stupidity, with brown </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rotting teeth and small dark eyes. The left side of his face was slick with scar where </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">an axe had cut off his ear and part of his cheek. He was as predictable as he was </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="559" height="22" font="2">ugly, but Tyrion <i>was</i> hungry. He reached up for the plate. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Mord jerked it away, grinning. “Is here,” he said, holding it out beyond </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="153" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s reach. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The dwarf climbed stiffly to his feet, every joint aching. “Must we play the </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">same fool’s game with every meal?” He made another grab for the beans. </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Mord shambled backward, grinning through his rotten teeth. “Is here, dwarf </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">man.” He held the plate out at arm’s length, over the edge where the cell ended and </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="521" height="22" font="2">the sky began. “You not want eat? Here. Come take.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s arms were too short to reach the plate, and he was not about to step </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that close to the edge. All it would take would be a quick shove of Mord’s heavy </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">white belly, and he would end up a sickening red splotch on the stones of Sky, like </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">so many other prisoners of the Eyrie over the centuries. “Come to think on it, I’m </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="661" height="22" font="2">not hungry after all,” he declared, retreating to the corner of his cell. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mord grunted and opened his thick fingers. The wind took the plate, flipping </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">it over as it fell. A handful of beans sprayed back at them as the food tumbled out of </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="650" height="22" font="2">sight. The turnkey laughed, his gut shaking like a bowl of pudding. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion felt a pang of rage. “You fucking son of a pox-ridden ass,” he spat. “I </text>

<text top="1063" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">For that, Mord gave him a kick, driving a steel-toed boot hard into Tyrion’s </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">For a small man, he had been cursed with a dangerously big mouth, he </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">reflected as he crawled back to his corner of what the Arryns laughably called their </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dungeon. He huddled beneath the thin blanket that was his only bedding, staring out </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at a blaze of empty blue sky and distant mountains that seemed to go on forever, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wishing he still had the shadowskin cloak he’d won from Marillion at dice, after the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">singer had stolen it off the body of that brigand chief. The skin had smelled of blood </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and mold, but it was warm and thick. Mord had taken it the moment he laid eyes on </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="25" height="22" font="2">it. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The wind tugged at his blanket with gusts sharp as talons. His cell was </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">miserably small, even for a dwarf. Not five feet away, where a wall ought to have </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">been, where a wall  <i>would</i>  be in a proper dungeon, the floor ended and the sky </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">began. He had plenty of fresh air and sunshine, and the moon and stars by night, but </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Tyrion would have traded it all in an instant for the dankest, gloomiest pit in the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">bowels of the Casterly Rock. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You fly,” Mord had promised him, when he’d shoved him into the cell. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="470" height="22" font="2">“Twenty day, thirty, fifty maybe. Then you fly.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The Arryns kept the only dungeon in the realm where the prisoners were </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">welcome to escape at will. That first day, after girding up his courage for hours, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion had lain flat on his stomach and squirmed to the edge, to poke out his head </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and look down. Sky was six hundred feet below, with nothing between but empty </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">air. If he craned his neck out as far as it could go, he could see other cells to his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">right and left and above him. He was a bee in a stone honeycomb, and someone had </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="182" height="22" font="2">torn off his wings. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was cold in the cell, the wind screamed night and day, and worst of all, the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">floor  <i>sloped</i>.  Ever so slightly, yet it was enough. He was afraid to close his eyes, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">afraid that he might roll over in his steep and wake in sudden terror as he went </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="624" height="22" font="2">sliding off the edge. Small wonder the sky cells drove men mad. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Gods save me</i>, some previous tenant had written on the wall in something that </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">looked suspiciously like blood,  <i>the blue is calling</i>.  At first Tyrion wondered who </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he’d been, and what had become of him; later, he decided that he would rather not </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">know. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="323" height="22" font="2">If only he had shut his mouth. . .  </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The wretched boy had started it, looking down on him from a throne of carved </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">weirwood beneath the moon-and-falcon banners of House Arryn. Tyrion Lannister </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had been looked down on all his life, but seldom by rheumy-eyed six-year-olds who </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">needed to stuff fat cushions under their cheeks to lift them to the height of a man. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">“Is he the bad man?” the boy had asked, clutching his doll. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He is,” the Lady Lysa had said from the lesser throne beside him. She was all </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="514" height="22" font="2">“He’s so <i>small</i>,” the Lord of the Eyrie said, giggling. </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raised her voice so it carried down the length of High Hall of the Eyrie, ringing off </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the milk-white walls and the slender pillars, so every man could hear it. “<i>He slew </i></text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="514" height="22" font="2">“Oh, did I kill him too?” Tyrion had said, like a fool. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That would have been a very good time to have kept his mouth closed and his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">head bowed. He could see that now; seven hells, he had seen it then. The High Hall </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">of the Arryns was long and austere, with a forbidding coldness to its walls of blue-</text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">veined white marble, but the faces around him had been colder by far. The power of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock was far away, and there were no friends of the Lannisters in the Vale </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">of Arryn. Submission and silence would have been his best defenses. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">But Tyrion’s mood had been too foul for sense. To his shame, he had faltered </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">during the last leg of their day-long climb up to the Eyrie, his stunted legs unable to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">take him any higher. Bronn had carried him the rest of the way, and the humiliation </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">poured oil on the flames of his anger. “It would seem I’ve been a busy little fellow,” </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he said with bitter sarcasm. “I wonder when I found the time to do all this slaying </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He ought to have remembered who he was dealing with. Lysa Arryn and her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">half-sane weakling son had not been known at court for their love of wit, especially </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">when it was directed at them. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Imp,” Lysa said coldly, “you will guard that mocking tongue of yours and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">speak to my son politely, or I promise you will have cause to regret it. Remember </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">where you are. This is the Eyrie, and these are knights of the Vale you see around </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="772" height="22" font="2">you, true men who loved Jon Arryn well. Every one of them would die for me.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lady Arryn, should any harm come to me, my brother Jaime will be pleased </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="2">to see that they do.” Even as he spat out the words, Tyrion knew they were folly. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Can you fly, my lord of Lannister?” Lady Lysa asked. “Does a dwarf have </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">wings? If not, you would be wiser to swallow the next threat that comes to mind.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="542" height="22" font="2">“I made no threats,” Tyrion said. “That was a promise.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Little Lord Robert hopped to his feet at that, so upset he dropped his doll. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“You can’t hurt us,” he screamed. “No one can hurt us here. Tell him, Mother, tell </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="507" height="22" font="2">him he can’t hurt us here.” The boy began to twitch. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Eyrie is impregnable,” Lysa Arryn declared calmly. She drew her son </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">close, holding him safe in the circle of her plump white arms. “The Imp is trying to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">frighten us, sweet baby. The Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my sweet </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">boy.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The hell of it was, she was no doubt right. Having seen what it took to get </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">here, Tyrion could well imagine how it would be for a knight trying to fight his way </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">up in armor, while stones and arrows poured down from above and enemies </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">contested with him for every step.  <i>Nightmare</i>  did not begin to describe it. Small </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">wonder the Eyrie had never been taken. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Still, Tyrion had been unable to silence himself. “Not impregnable,” he said, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="230" height="22" font="2">“merely inconvenient.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Young Robert pointed down, his hand trembling. “You’re a  <i>liar</i>.  Mother, I </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">want to see him fly.” Two guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks seized Tyrion by the arms, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">lifting him off his floor. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The gods only know what might have happened then were it not for Catelyn </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Stark. “Sister,” she called out from where she stood below the thrones, “I beg you </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="652" height="22" font="2">to remember, this man is <i>my</i> prisoner. I will not have him harmed.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Lysa  Arryn glanced at her sister coolly for a moment, then rose and swept </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down on Tyrion, her long skirts trailing after her. For an instant he feared she would </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">strike him, but instead she commanded them to release him. Her men shoved him to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="581" height="22" font="2">the floor, his legs went out from under him, and Tyrion fell. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He must have made quite a sight as he struggled to his knees, only to feel his </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">right leg spasm, sending him sprawling once more. Laughter boomed up and down </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="277" height="22" font="2">the High Hall of the Arryns. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“My sister’s little guest is too weary to stand,” Lady Lysa announced. “Ser </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Vardis, take him down to the dungeon. A rest in one of our sky cells will do him </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">much good.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The guardsmen jerked him upright. Tyrion Lannister dangled between them, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">kicking feebly, his face red with shame. “I will remember this,” he told them all as </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">they carried him off. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">And so he did, for all the good it did him. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">At first he had consoled himself that this imprisonment could not last long. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lysa Arryn wanted to humble him, that was all. She would send for him again, and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">soon. If not her, then Catelyn Stark would want to question him. This time he would </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">guard his tongue more closely. They dare not kill him out of hand; he was still a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lannister of Casterly Rock, and if they shed his blood, it would mean war. Or so he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="168" height="22" font="2">had told himself. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="266" height="22" font="2">Now he was not so certain. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here, but he feared he did not </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have the strength to rot for long. He was growing weaker every day, and it was only </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a matter of time until Mord’s kicks and blows did him serious harm, provided the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gaoler did not starve him to death first. A few more nights of cold and hunger, and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="378" height="22" font="2">the blue would start calling to him too. </text>
</page>
<page number="331" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He wondered what was happening beyond the walls (such as they were) of his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cell. Lord Tywin would surely have sent out riders when the word reached him. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">Jaime might be leading a host through the Mountains of the Moon even </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">now. . . unless he was riding north against Winterfell instead. Did anyone outside </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the Vale even suspect where Catelyn Stark had taken him? He wondered what </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Cersei would do when she heard. The king could order him freed, but would Robert </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">listen to his queen or his Hand? Tyrion had no illusions about the king’s love for his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">sister. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">If Cersei kept her wits about her, she would insist the king sit in judgment of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">Tyrion himself. Even Ned Stark could scarcely object to that, not without </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">impugning the honor of the king. And Tyrion would be only too glad to take his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">chances in a trial. Whatever murders they might lay at his door, the Starks had no </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">proof of anything so far as he could see. Let them make their case before the Iron </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Throne and the lords of the land. It would be the end of them. If only Cersei were </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">clever enough to see that. . .  </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister sighed. His sister was not without a certain low cunning, but </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">her pride blinded her. She would see the insult in this, not the opportunity. And </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Jaime was even worse, rash and headstrong and quick to anger. His brother never </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">untied a knot when he could slash it in two with his sword. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He wondered which of them had sent the footpad to silence the Stark boy, and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whether they had truly conspired at the death of Lord Arryn. If the old Hand had </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been murdered, it was deftly and subtly done. Men of his age died of sudden illness </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">all the time. In contrast, sending some oaf with a stolen knife after Brandon Stark </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">struck him as unbelievably clumsy. And wasn’t  <i>that</i>  peculiar, come to think on </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="55" height="22" font="2">it. . .  </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion shivered. Now  <i>there</i>  was a nasty suspicion. Perhaps the direwolf and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the lion were not the only beasts in the woods, and if that was true, someone was </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">using him as a catspaw. Tyrion Lannister hated being used. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He would have to get out of here, and soon. His chances of overpowering </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">Mord were small to none, and no one was about to smuggle him a six-hundred-foot-</text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">long rope, so he would have to talk himself free. His mouth had gotten him into this </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="354" height="22" font="2">cell; it could damn well get him out. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion pushed himself to his feet, doing his best to ignore the slope of the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">floor beneath him, with its ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge. He hammered on the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">door with a fist. “<i>Mord!</i>” he shouted. “<i>Turnkey! Mord, I want you!</i>” He had to keep </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it up a good ten minutes before he heard footsteps. Tyrion stepped back an instant </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="356" height="22" font="2">before the door opened with a crash. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Making noise,” Mord growled, with blood in his eyes. Dangling from one </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">meaty hand was a leather strap, wide and thick, doubled over in his fist. </text>
</page>
<page number="332" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>Never show them you’re afraid</i>, Tyrion reminded himself. “How would you </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">like to be rich?” he asked. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Mord hit him. He swung the strap backhand, lazily, but the leather caught </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tyrion high on the arm. The force of it staggered him, and the pain made him grit </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="523" height="22" font="2">his teeth. “No mouth, dwarf man,” Mord warned him. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="778" height="22" font="2">“Gold,” Tyrion said, miming a smile. “Casterly Rock is full of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gold. . . <i>ahhhh</i>. . .”  This time the blow was a forehand, and Mord put more of his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">arm into the swing, making the leather crack and jump. It caught Tyrion in the ribs </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and dropped him to his knees, whimpering. He forced himself to look up at the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">gaoler. “As rich as the Lannisters,” he wheezed. “That’s what they say, Mord—” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mord grunted. The strap whistled through the air and smashed Tyrion full in </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the face. The pain was so bad he did not remember falling, but when he opened his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eyes again he was on the floor of his cell. His ear was ringing, and his mouth was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">full of blood. He groped for purchase, to push himself up, and his fingers brushed </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">against. . . nothing. Tyrion snatched his hand back as fast as if it had been scalded, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and tried his best to stop breathing. He had fallen right on the edge, inches from the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">blue. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“More to say?” Mord held the strap between his fists and gave it a sharp pull. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="495" height="22" font="2">The snap made Tyrion jump. The turnkey laughed. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>He won’t push me over</i>, Tyrion told himself desperately as he crawled away </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from the edge. <i>Catelyn Stark wants me alive, he doesn’t dare kill me</i>. He wiped the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">blood off his lips with the back of his hand, grinned, and said, “That was a stiff one, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Mord.” The gaoler squinted at him, trying to decide if he was being mocked. “I </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could make good use of a strong man like you.” The strap flew at him, but this time </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was able to cringe away from it. He took a glancing blow to the shoulder, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nothing more. “Gold,” he repeated, scrambling backward like a crab, “more gold </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">than you’ll see here in a lifetime. Enough to buy land, women, horses. . . you could </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">be a lord. Lord Mord.” Tyrion hawked up a glob of blood and phlegm and spat it </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">out into the sky. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="239" height="22" font="2">“Is no gold,” Mord said. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>He’s listening!  </i>Tyrion thought. “They relieved me of my purse when they </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">captured me, but the gold is still mine. Catelyn Stark might take a man prisoner, but </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">she’d never stoop to rob him. That wouldn’t be honorable. Help me, and all the gold </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">is yours.” Mord’s strap licked out, but it was a halfhearted, desultory swing, slow </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and contemptuous. Tyrion caught the leather in his hand and held it prisoned. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">“There will be no risk to you. All you need do is deliver a message.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The gaoler yanked his leather strap free of Tyrion’s grasp. “Message,” he said, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="806" height="22" font="2">as if he had never heard the word before. His frown made deep creases in his brow. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You heard me, my lord. Only carry my word to your lady. Tell her. . .” </text>
</page>
<page number="333" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="4"><i>What? What would possibly make Lysa Anyn relent?</i>  The inspiration came to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister suddenly. “. . ..tell her that I wish to confess my crimes.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Mord raised his arm and Tyrion braced himself for another blow, but the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">turnkey hesitated. Suspicion and greed warred in his eyes. He wanted that gold, yet </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he feared a trick; he had the look of a man who had often been tricked. “Is lie,” he </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="398" height="22" font="2">muttered darkly. “Dwarf man cheat me.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="489" height="22" font="2">“I will put my promise in writing,” Tyrion vowed. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Some illiterates held writing in disdain; others seemed to have a superstitious </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">reverence for the written word, as if it were some sort of magic. Fortunately, Mord </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was one of the latter. The turnkey lowered the strap. “Writing down gold. Much </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">gold.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Oh,  <i>much</i>  gold,” Tyrion assured him. “The purse is just a taste, my friend. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">My brother wears armor of solid gold plate.” In truth, Jaime’s armor was gilded </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">steel, but this oaf would never know the difference. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mord fingered his strap thoughtfully, but in the end, he relented and went to </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">fetch paper and ink. When the letter was written, the gaoler frowned at it </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">suspiciously. “Now deliver my message,” Tyrion urged. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He was shivering in his sleep when they came for him, late that night. Mord </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">opened the door but kept his silence. Ser Vardis Egen woke Tyrion with the point of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">his boot. “On your feet, Imp. My lady wants to see you.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion rubbed the sleep from his eyes and put on a grimace he scarcely felt. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="639" height="22" font="2">“No doubt she does, but what makes you think I wish to see her?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis frowned. Tyrion remembered him well from the years he had spent </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at King’s Landing as the captain of the Hand’s household guard. A square, plain </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face, silver hair, a heavy build, and no humor whatsoever. “Your wishes are not my </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">concern. On your feet, or I’ll have you carried.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion clambered awkwardly to his feet. “A cold night,” he said casually, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“and the High Hall is so drafty. I don’t wish to catch a chill. Mord, if you would be </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">so good, fetch my cloak.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="510" height="22" font="2">The gaoler squinted at him, face dull with suspicion. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“My  <i>cloak</i>,” Tyrion repeated. “The shadowskin you took from me for </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">safekeeping. You recall.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="462" height="22" font="2">“Get him the damnable cloak,” Ser Vardis said. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Mord did not dare grumble. He gave Tyrion a glare that promised future </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">retribution, yet he went for the cloak. When he draped it around his prisoner’s neck, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tyrion smiled. “My thanks. I shall think of you whenever I wear it.” He flung the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">trailing end of the long fur over his right shoulder, and felt warm for the first time in </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">days. “Lead on, Ser Vardis.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The High Hall of the Arryns was aglow with the light of fifty torches, burning </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">in the sconces along the walls. The Lady Lysa wore black silk, with the moon-and-</text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">falcon sewn on her breast in pearls. Since she did not look the sort to join the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Night’s Watch, Tyrion could only imagine that she had decided mourning clothes </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">were appropriate garb for a confession. Her long auburn hair, woven into an </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">elaborate braid, fell across her left shoulder. The taller throne beside her was empty; </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">no doubt the little Lord of the Eyrie was off shaking in his sleep. Tyrion was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="307" height="22" font="2">thankful for that much, at least. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He bowed deeply and took a moment to glance around the hall. Lady Arryn </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had summoned her knights and retainers to hear his confession, as he had hoped. He </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">saw Ser Brynden Tully’s craggy face and Lord Nestor Royce’s bluff one. Beside </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Nestor stood a younger man with fierce black side-whiskers who could only be his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">heir, Ser Albar. Most of the principal houses of the Vale were represented. Tyrion </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">noted Ser Lyn Corbray, slender as a sword, Lord Hunter with his gouty legs, the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">widowed Lady Waynwood surrounded by her sons. Others sported sigils he did not </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="626" height="22" font="2">know; broken lance, green viper, burning tower, winged chalice. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Among the lords of the Vale were several of his companions from the high </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">road; Ser Rodrik Cassel, pale from half-healed wounds, stood with Ser Willis Wode </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">beside him. Marillion the singer had found a new woodharp. Tyrion smiled; </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whatever happened here tonight, he did not wish it to happen in secret, and there </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="568" height="22" font="2">was no one like a singer for spreading a story near and far. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">In the rear of the hall, Bronn lounged beneath a pillar. The freerider’s black </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">eyes were fixed on Tyrion, and his hand lay lightly on the pommel of his sword. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">Tyrion gave him a long look, wondering. . .  </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="717" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark spoke first. “You wish to confess your crimes, we are told.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="335" height="22" font="2">“I do, my lady,” Tyrion answered. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lysa Arryn smiled at her sister. “The sky cells always break them. The gods </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="540" height="22" font="2">can see them there, and there is no darkness to hide in.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="516" height="22" font="2">“He does not look broken to me,” Lady Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="729" height="22" font="2">Lady Lysa paid her no mind. “Say what you will,” she commanded Tyrion. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>And now to roll the dice</i>, he thought with another quick glance back at Bronn. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Where to begin? I am a vile little man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">counting, my lords and ladies. I have lain with whores, not once but hundreds of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">times. I have wished my own lord father dead, and my sister, our gracious queen, as </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">well.” Behind him, someone chuckled. “I have not always treated my servants with </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kindness. I have gambled. I have even cheated, I blush to admit. I have said many </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cruel and malicious things about the noble lords and ladies of the court.” That drew </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="289" height="22" font="2">outright laughter. “Once I—” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Silence!</i>” Lysa Arryn’s pale round face had turned a burning pink. “What do </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">you imagine you are doing, dwarf?” </text>
</page>
<page number="335" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">Tyrion cocked his head to one side. “Why, confessing my crimes, my lady—” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark took a step forward. “You are accused of sending a hired knife </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder Lord Jon Arryn, the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">Hand of the King.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion gave a helpless shrug. “<i>Those </i>crimes I cannot confess, I fear. I know </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="247" height="22" font="2">nothing of any murders.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lady Lysa rose from her weirwood throne. “I will not be made mock of. You </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have had your little jape, Imp. I trust you enjoyed it. Ser Vardis, take him back to </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the dungeon. . . but this time find him a smaller cell, with a floor more sharply </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">sloped.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Is  <i>this</i>  how justice is done in the Vale?” Tyrion roared, so loudly that Ser </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Vardis froze for an instant. “Does honor stop at the Bloody Gate? You accuse me of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crimes, I deny them, so you throw me into an open cell to freeze and starve.” He </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lifted his head, to give them all a good look at the bruises Mord had left on his face. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Where is the king’s justice? Is the Eyrie not part of the Seven Kingdoms? I stand </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">accused, you say. Very well. I  <i>demand a trial!</i>  Let me speak, and let my truth or </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">falsehood be judged openly, in the sight of gods and men.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">A low murmuring filled the High Hall. He had her, Tyrion knew. He was </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">highborn, the son of the most powerful lord in the realm, the brother of the queen. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He could not be denied a trial. Guardsmen in sky-blue cloaks had started toward </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="605" height="22" font="2">Tyrion, but Ser Vardis bid them halt and looked to Lady Lysa. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Her small mouth twitched in a petulant smile. “If you are tried and found to be </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">guilty of the crimes for which you stand accused, then by the king’s own laws, you </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">must pay with your life’s blood. We keep no  headsman in the Eyrie, my lord of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">Lannister. Open the Moon Door.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The press of spectators parted. A narrow weirwood door stood between two </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">slender marble pillars, a crescent moon carved in the white wood. Those standing </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">closest edged backward as a pair of guardsmen marched through. One man removed </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the heavy bronze bars; the second pulled the door inward. Their blue cloaks rose </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">snapping from their shoulders, caught in the sudden gust of wind that came howling </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">through the open door. Beyond was the emptiness of the night sky, speckled with </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">cold uncaring stars. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Behold the king’s justice,” Lysa Arryn said. Torch flames fluttered like </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="686" height="22" font="2">pennons along the walls, and here and there the odd torch guttered out. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Lysa, I think this unwise,” Catelyn Stark said as the black wind swirled </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">around the hall. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her sister ignored her. “You want a trial, my lord of Lannister. Very well, a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">trial you shall have. My son will listen to whatever you care to say, and you shall </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">hear his judgment. Then you may leave. . . by one door or the other.” </text>
</page>
<page number="336" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She looked so pleased with herself, Tyrion thought, and small wonder. How </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">could a trial threaten her, when her weakling son was the lord judge? Tyrion </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">glanced at her Moon Door.  <i>Mother, I want to see him fly!</i>  the boy had said. How </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">many men had the snot-nosed little wretch sent through that door already? </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I thank you, my good lady, but I see no need to trouble Lord Robert,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said politely. “The gods know the truth of my innocence. I will have their verdict, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="512" height="22" font="2">not the judgment of men. I demand trial by combat.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A storm of sudden laughter filled the High Hall of the Arryns. Lord Nestor </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Royce snorted, Ser Willis chuckled, Ser Lyn Corbray guffawed, and others threw </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">back their heads and howled until tears ran down their faces. Marillion clumsily </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">plucked a gay note on his new woodharp with the fingers of his broken hand. Even </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the wind seemed to whistle with derision as it came skirling through the Moon </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">Door. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Lysa Arryn’s watery blue eyes looked uncertain. He had caught her off </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="410" height="22" font="2">balance. “You have that right, to be sure.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The young knight with the green viper embroidered on his surcoat stepped </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">forward and went to one knee. “My lady, I beg the boon of championing your </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">cause.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The honor should be mine,” old Lord Hunter said. “For the love I bore your </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">lord husband, let me avenge his death.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My father served Lord Jon faithfully as High Steward of the Vale,” Ser Albar </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">Royce boomed. “Let me serve his son in this.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The gods favor the man with the just cause,” said Ser Lyn Corbray, “yet </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">often that turns out to be the man with the surest sword. We all know who that is.” </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="204" height="22" font="2">He smiled modestly. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A dozen other men all spoke at once, clamoring to be heard. Tyrion found it </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">disheartening to realize so many strangers were eager to kill him. Perhaps this had </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">not been such a clever plan after all. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Lady Lysa raised a hand for silence. “I thank you, my lords, as I know my son </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would thank you if he were among us. No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and true as the knights of the Vale. Would that I could grant you all this honor. Yet </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">I can choose only one.” She gestured. “Ser Vardis Egen, you were ever my lord </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">husband’s good right hand. You shall be our champion.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis had been singularly silent. “My lady,” he said gravely, sinking to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">one knee, “pray give this burden to another, I have no taste for it. The man is no </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">warrior. Look at him. A dwarf, half my size and lame in the legs. It would be </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="395" height="22" font="2">Oh, <i>excellent</i>, Tyrion thought. “I agree.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="538" height="22" font="2">Lysa glared at him. “You demanded a trial by combat.” </text>
</page>
<page number="337" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“And now I demand a champion, such as you have chosen for yourself. My </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">brother Jaime will gladly take my part, I know.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Your precious Kingslayer is hundreds of leagues from here,” snapped Lysa </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">Arryn. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="510" height="22" font="2">“Send a bird for him. I will gladly await his arrival.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="419" height="22" font="2">“You will face Ser Vardis on the morrow.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Singer,” Tyrion said, turning to Marillion, “when you make a ballad of this, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">be certain you tell them how Lady Arryn denied the dwarf the right to a champion, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest knight.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I deny you  <i>nothing</i>!” Lysa Arryn said, her voice peeved and shrill with </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">irritation. “Name your champion, Imp. . . if you think you can find a man to die for </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">you.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If it is all the same to you, I’d sooner find one to kill for me.” Tyrion looked </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">over the long hall. No one moved. For a long moment he wondered if it had all been </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">a colossal blunder. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Then there was a stirring in the rear of the chamber. “I’ll stand for the dwarf,” </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="172" height="22" font="2">Bronn called out. </text>

<text top="290" left="135" width="380" height="22" font="2">fallen, and Lyanna in her bed of blood. </text>
<text top="318" left="189" width="686" height="22" font="2">In the dream his friends rode with him, as they had in life. Proud </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Martyn Cassel, Jory’s father; faithful Theo Wull; Ethan Glover, who had been </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Brandon’s squire; Ser Mark Ryswell, soft of speech and gentle of heart; the </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crannogman, Howland Reed; Lord Dustin on his great red stallion. Ned had known </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">their faces as well as he knew his own once, but the years leech at a man’s </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">memories, even those he has vowed never to forget. In the dream they were only </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">shadows, grey wraiths on horses made of mist. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They were seven, facing three. In the dream as it had been in life. Yet these </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were no ordinary three. They waited before the round tower, the red mountains of </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Dorne at their backs, their white cloaks blowing in the wind. And these were no </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shadows; their faces burned clear, even now. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over  his right shoulder. Ser Oswell Whent was on one knee, sharpening his blade </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">with a whetstone. Across his white-enameled helm, the black bat of his House </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spread its wings. Between them stood fierce old Ser Gerold Hightower, the White </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="416" height="22" font="2">Bull, Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">“I looked for you on the Trident,” Ned said to them. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="423" height="22" font="2">“We were not there,” Ser Gerold answered. </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">“Woe to the Usurper if we had been,” said Ser Oswell. </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“When King’s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">and I wondered where you were.” </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="396" height="22" font="2">false brother would burn in seven hells.” </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I came down on Storm’s End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, “and the Lords </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and  all their knights bent the knee to </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.” </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="540" height="22" font="2">“Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne. </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.” </text>

<page number="339" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="530" height="22" font="2">“Ser Willem is a good man and true,” said Ser Oswell. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“But not of the Kingsguard,” Ser Gerold pointed out. “The Kingsguard does </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">not flee.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="519" height="22" font="2">“Then or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="446" height="22" font="2">“We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They were </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="194" height="22" font="2">seven against three. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="157" height="22" font="2">alive with light. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ned said with sadness in his voice. “Now it ends.” As they came </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">together in a rush of steel and shadow, he could hear Lyanna screaming. “<i>Eddard!</i>” </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she called. A storm of rose petals blew across a blood-streaked sky, as blue as the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">eyes of death. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard,” Lyanna called again. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="462" height="22" font="2">“I promise,” he whispered. “Lya, I promise. . .” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="436" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard,” a man echoed from the dark. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Groaning, Eddard Stark opened his eyes. Moonlight streamed through the tall </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">windows of the Tower of the Hand. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="451" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard?” A shadow stood over the bed. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“How. . . how long?” The sheets were tangled, his leg splinted and plastered. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">A dull throb of pain shot up his side. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Six days and seven nights.” The voice was Vayon Poole’s. The steward held </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">a cup to Ned’s lips. “Drink, my lord.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="120" height="22" font="2">“What. . .?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="555" height="22" font="2">“Only water. Maester Pycelle said you would be thirsty.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned drank. His lips were parched and cracked. The water tasted sweet as </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">honey. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The king left orders,” Vayon Poole told him when the cup was empty. “He </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="321" height="22" font="2">would speak with you, my lord.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“On the morrow,” Ned said. “When I am stronger.” He could not face Robert </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">now. The dream had left him weak as a kitten. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My lord,” Poole said, “he commanded us to send you to him the moment you </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">opened your eyes.” The steward busied himself lighting a bedside candle. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned cursed softly. Robert was never known for his patience. “Tell him I’m </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">too weak to come to him. If he wishes to speak with me, I should be pleased to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">receive him here. I hope you wake him from a sound sleep. And summon. . .”  He </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">was about to say <i>Jory</i> when he remembered. “Summon the captain of my guard.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Alyn stepped into the bedchamber a few moments after the steward had taken </text>
</page>
<page number="340" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">his leave. “My lord.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Poole tells me it has been six days,” Ned said. “I must know how things </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">stand.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The Kingslayer is fled the city,” Alyn told him. “The talk is he’s ridden back </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to Casterly Rock to join his father. The story of how Lady Catelyn took the Imp is </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="553" height="22" font="2">on every lip. I have put on extra guards, if it please you.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="442" height="22" font="2">“It does,” Ned assured him. “My daughters?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“They have been  with you every day, my lord. Sansa prays quietly, but </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Arya. . .” He hesitated. “She has not said a word since they brought you back. She </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="678" height="22" font="2">is a fierce little thing, my lord. I have never seen such anger in a girl.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Whatever happens,” Ned said, “I want my daughters kept safe. I fear this is </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">only the beginning.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No harm will come to them, Lord Eddard,” Alyn said. “I stake my life on </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">that.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="239" height="22" font="2">“Jory and the others. . .” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I gave them over to the silent sisters, to be sent north to Winterfell. Jory </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">would want to lie beside his grandfather.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It would have to be his grandfather, for Jory’s father was buried far to the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">south. Martyn Cassel had perished with the rest. Ned had pulled the tower down </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">afterward, and used its bloody stones to build eight cairns upon the ridge. It was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said that Rhaegar had named that place the tower of joy, but for Ned it was a bitter </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">memory. They had been seven against three, yet only two had lived to ride away; </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark himself and the little crannogman, Howland Reed. He did not think it </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="701" height="22" font="2">omened well that he should dream that dream again after so many years. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You’ve done well, Alyn,” Ned was saying when Vayon Poole returned. The </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">steward bowed low. “His Grace is without, my lord, and the queen with him.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned pushed himself up higher, wincing as his leg trembled with pain. He had </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not expected Cersei to come. It did not bode well that she had. “Send them in, and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leave us. What we have to say should not go beyond these walls.” Poole withdrew </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">quietly. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Robert had taken time to dress. He wore a black velvet doublet with the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crowned stag of Baratheon worked upon the breast in golden thread, and a golden </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">mantle with a cloak of black and gold squares. A flagon of wine was in his hand, his </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">face already flushed from drink. Cersei Lannister entered behind him, a jeweled </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">tiara in her hair. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="538" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace,” Ned said. “Your pardons. I cannot rise.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No matter,” the king said gruffly. “Some wine? From the Arbor. A good </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">vintage.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="757" height="22" font="2">“A small cup,” Ned said. “My head is still heavy from the milk of the poppy.” </text>
</page>
<page number="341" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A man in your place should count himself fortunate that his head is still on </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="341" height="22" font="2">his shoulders,” the queen declared. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Quiet, woman,” Robert snapped. He brought Ned a cup of wine. “Does the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="188" height="22" font="2">leg still pain you?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Some,” Ned said. His head was swimming, but it would not do to admit to </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="306" height="22" font="2">weakness in front of the queen. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Pycelle swears it will heal clean.” Robert frowned. “I take it you know what </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">Catelyn has done?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I do.” Ned took a small swallow of wine. “My lady wife is blameless, Your </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="433" height="22" font="2">Grace. All she did she did at my command.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="419" height="22" font="2">“I am <i>not</i> pleased, Ned,” Robert grumbled. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“By what right do you dare lay hands on my blood?” Cersei demanded. “Who </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">do you think you are?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Hand of the King,” Ned told her with icy courtesy. “Charged by your </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="721" height="22" font="2">own lord husband to keep the king’s peace and enforce the king’s justice.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="486" height="22" font="2">“You <i>were</i> the Hand,” Cersei began, “but now—” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>Silence!</i>” the king roared. “You asked him a question and he answered it.” </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Cersei subsided, cold with anger, and Robert turned back to Ned. “Keep the king’s </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="756" height="22" font="2">peace, you say. Is this how you keep my peace, Ned? Seven men are dead. . .” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Eight,” the queen corrected. “Tregar died this morning, of the blow Lord </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="168" height="22" font="2">Stark gave him.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Abductions on the kingsroad and drunken slaughter in my streets,” the king </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">said. “I will not have it, Ned.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">“Catelyn had good reason for taking the Imp—” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I said, I will <i>not</i> have it! To hell with her reasons. You will command her to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">release the dwarf at once, and you will make your peace with Jaime.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Three of my men were butchered before my eyes, because Jaime Lannister </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="427" height="22" font="2">wished to <i>chasten</i> me. Am I to forget that?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“My brother was not the cause of this quarrel,” Cersei told the king. “Lord </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Stark was returning drunk from a brothel. His men attacked Jaime and his guards, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="500" height="22" font="2">even as his wife attacked Tyrion on the kingsroad.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You know me better than that, Robert,” Ned said. “Ask Lord Baelish if you </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">doubt me. He was there.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I’ve talked to Littlefinger,” Robert said. “He claims he rode off to bring the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gold cloaks before the fighting began, but he admits you were returning from some </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">whorehouse.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Some  </i>whorehouse? Damn your eyes, Robert, I went there to have a look at </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your daughter! Her mother has named her Barra. She looks like that first girl you </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fathered, when we were boys together in the Vale.” He watched the queen as he </text>
</page>
<page number="342" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">spoke; her face was a mask, still and pale, betraying nothing. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert flushed. “Barra,” he grumbled. “Is that supposed to please me? Damn </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="383" height="22" font="2">the girl. I thought she had more sense.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“She cannot be more than fifteen, and a whore, and you thought she had </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>sense</i>?” Ned said, incredulous. His leg was beginning to pain him sorely. It was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">hard to keep his temper. “The fool child is in love with you, Robert.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="693" height="22" font="2">The king glanced at Cersei. “This is no fit subject for the queen’s ears.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Her Grace will have no liking for anything I have to say,” Ned replied. “I am </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">told the Kingslayer has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The king swirled the wine in his cup, brooding. He took a swallow. “No,” he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said. “I want no more of this. Jaime slew three of your men, and you five of his. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">Now it ends.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Is that your notion of justice?” Ned flared. “If so, I am pleased that I am no </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="192" height="22" font="2">longer your Hand.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The queen looked to her husband. “If any man had dared speak to a Targaryen </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="268" height="22" font="2">as he has spoken to you—” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="477" height="22" font="2">“Do you take me for Aerys?” Robert interrupted. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I took you for a <i>king</i>. Jaime and Tyrion are your own brothers, by all the laws </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of marriage and the bonds we share. The Starks have driven off the one and seized </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the other. This man dishonors you with every breath he takes, and yet you stand </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="699" height="22" font="2">there meekly, asking if his leg pains him and would he like some wine.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert’s face was dark with anger. “How many times must I tell you to hold </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">your tongue, woman?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Cersei’s face was a study in contempt. “What a jape the gods have made of us </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">two,” she said. “By all rights, you ought to be in skirts and me in mail.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Purple with rage, the king lashed out, a vicious backhand blow to the side of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the head. She stumbled against the table and fell hard, yet Cersei Lannister did not </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cry out. Her slender fingers brushed her cheek, where the pale smooth skin was </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">already reddening. On the morrow the bruise would cover half her face. “I shall </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">wear this as a badge of honor,” she announced. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Wear it in silence, or I’ll honor you again,” Robert vowed. He shouted for a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">guard. Ser Meryn Trant stepped into the room, tall and somber in his white armor. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“The queen is tired. See her to her bedchamber.” The knight helped Cersei to her </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="349" height="22" font="2">feet and led her out without a word. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert reached for the flagon and refilled his cup. “You see what she does to </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">me, Ned.” The king seated himself, cradling his wine cup. “My loving wife. The </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mother of my children.” The rage was gone from him now; in his eyes Ned saw </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">something sad and scared. “I should not have hit her. That was not. . . that was not </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>kingly</i>.” He stared down at his hands, as if he did not quite know what they were. “I </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="831" height="22" font="2">someone if you can’t hit them?” Confused, the king shook his head. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“Rhaegar. . . Rhaegar  <i>won</i>,  damn him. I killed him, Ned, I drove the spike right </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">through that black armor into his black heart, and he died at my feet. They made up </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">songs about it. Yet somehow he still won. He has Lyanna now, and I have <i>her</i>.” The </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">king drained his cup. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="479" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace,” Ned Stark said, “we must talk. . .” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert pressed his fingertips against his temples. “I am sick unto death of talk. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">On the morrow I’m going to the kingswood to hunt. Whatever you have to say can </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">wait until I return.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“If the gods are good, I shall not be here on your return. You commanded me </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">to return to Winterfell, remember?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robert stood up, grasping one of the bedposts to steady himself. “The gods </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">are seldom good, Ned. Here, this is yours.” He pulled the heavy silver hand clasp </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from a pocket in the lining of his cloak and tossed it on the bed. “Like it or not, you </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">are my Hand, damn you. I forbid you to leave.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned picked up the silver clasp. He was being given no choice, it seemed. His </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="685" height="22" font="2">leg throbbed, and he felt as helpless as a child. “The Targaryen girl—” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The king groaned. “Seven hells, don’t start with her again. That’s done, I’ll </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Why would you want me as your Hand, if you refuse to listen to my </text>

<text top="666" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Why?” Robert laughed. “Why not? Someone has to rule this damnable </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kingdom. Put on the badge, Ned. It suits you. And if you ever throw it in my face </text>

<text top="318" left="122" width="753" height="22" font="2">carved stone of the balustrade outside her window. Below her the world </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">turned from black to indigo to green as dawn crept across fields and forests. Pale </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">white mists rose off Alyssa’s Tears, where the ghost waters plunged over the </text>

<text top="428" left="54" width="600" height="22" font="2">Lance. Catelyn could feel the faint touch of spray on her face. </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Alyssa Arryn had seen her husband, her brothers, and all her children slain, </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and yet in life she had never shed a tear. So in death, the gods had decreed that she </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">would know no rest until her weeping watered the black earth of the Vale, where </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the men she had loved were buried. Alyssa had been dead six thousand years now, </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and still no drop of the torrent had ever reached the valley floor far below. Catelyn </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wondered how large a waterfall her own tears would make when she died. “Tell me </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">the rest of it,” she said. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“The Kingslayer is massing a host at Casterly Rock,” Ser Rodrik Cassel </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">answered from the room behind her. “Your brother writes that he has sent riders to </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the Rock, demanding that Lord Tywin proclaim his intent, but he has had no </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">answer. Edmure has commanded Lord Vance and Lord Piper to guard the pass </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">below the Golden Tooth. He vows to you that he will yield no foot of Tully land </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="456" height="22" font="2">without first watering it with Lannister blood.” </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn turned away from the sunrise. Its beauty did little to lighten her mood; </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it seemed cruel for a day to dawn so fair and end so foul as this one promised to. </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Edmure has sent riders and made vows,” she said, “but Edmure is not the Lord of </text>

<text top="925" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The message made no mention of Lord Hoster, my lady.” Ser Rodrik tugged </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">at his whiskers. They had grown in white as snow and bristly as a thornbush while </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik said. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Then she still plans to go through with this mummer’s farce?” Catelyn </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grimaced. “The dwarf has played her like a set of pipes, and she is too deaf to hear </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the tune. Whatever happens this morning, Ser Rodrik, it is past time we took our </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">leave. My place is at Winterfell with my sons. If you are strong enough to travel, I </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">shall ask Lysa for an escort to see us to Gulltown. We can take ship from there.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Another ship?” Ser Rodrik looked a shade green, yet he managed not to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">shudder. “As you say, my lady.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The old knight waited outside her door as Catelyn summoned the servants </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lysa had given her. If she spoke to her sister before the duel, perhaps she could </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">change her mind, she thought as they dressed her. Lysa’s policies varied with her </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">moods, and her moods changed hourly. The shy girl she had known at Riverrun had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">grown into a woman who was by turns proud, fearful, cruel, dreamy, reckless, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="468" height="22" font="2">timid, stubborn, vain, and, above all, inconstant. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When that vile turnkey of hers had come crawling to tell them that Tyrion </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lannister wished to confess, Catelyn had urged Lysa to have the dwarf brought to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them privately, but no, nothing would do but that her sister must make a show of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="418" height="22" font="2">him before half the Vale. And now this. . .  </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Lannister is  <i>my</i>  prisoner,” she told Ser Rodrik as they descended the tower </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stairs and made their way through the Eyrie’s cold white halls. Catelyn wore plain </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">grey wool with a silvered belt. “My sister must be reminded of that.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">At the doors to Lysa’s apartments, they met her uncle storming out. “Going to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">join the fool’s festival?” Ser Brynden snapped. “I’d tell you to slap some sense into </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">your sister, if I thought it would do any good, but you’d only bruise your hand.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="746" height="22" font="2">“There was a bird from Riverrun,” Catelyn began, “a letter from Edmure. . .” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I know, child.” The black fish that fastened his cloak was Brynden’s only </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">concession to ornament. “I had to hear it from Maester Colemon. I asked your sister </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">for leave to take a thousand seasoned men and ride for Riverrun with all haste. Do </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you know what she told me?  <i>The Vale cannot spare a thousand swords, nor even </i></text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>one, Uncle</i>, she said. <i>You are the Knight of the Gate. Your place is here</i>.” A gust of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">childish laughter drifted through the open doors behind him, and her uncle glanced </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">darkly over his shoulder. “Well, I told her she could bloody well find herself a new </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Knight of the Gate. Black fish or no, I am still a Tully. I shall leave for Riverrun by </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn could not pretend to surprise. “Alone? You know as well as I that you </text>

<text top="1108" left="54" width="791" height="22" font="2">with us, Uncle. I will give you your thousand men. Riverrun will not fight alone.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Brynden thought a moment, then nodded a brusque agreement. “As you say. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">It’s the long way home, but I’m more like to get there. I’ll wait for you below.” He </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">went striding off, his cloak swirling behind him. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn exchanged a look with Ser Rodrik. They went through the doors to </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">the high, nervous sound of a child’s giggles. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Lysa’s apartments opened over a small garden, a circle of dirt and grass </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">planted with blue flowers and ringed on all sides by tall white towers. The builders </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">had intended it as a godswood, but the Eyrie rested on the hard stone of the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mountain, and no matter how much soil was hauled up from the Vale, they could </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">not get a weirwood to take root here. So the Lords of the Eyrie planted grass and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">scattered statuary amidst low, flowering shrubs. It was there the two champions </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would meet to place their lives, and that of Tyrion Lannister, into the hands of the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">gods. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lysa, freshly scrubbed and garbed in cream velvet with a rope of sapphires </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and moonstones around her milk-white neck, was holding court on the terrace </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">overlooking the scene of the combat, surrounded by her knights, retainers, and lords </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">high and low. Most of them still hoped to wed her, bed her, and rule the Vale of </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Arryn by her side. From what Catelyn had seen during her stay at the Eyrie, it was a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">vain hope. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A wooden platform had been built to elevate Robert’s chair; there the Lord of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">the Eyrie sat, giggling and clapping his hands as a humpbacked puppeteer in blue-</text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and-white motley made two wooden knights hack and slash at each other. Pitchers </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of thick cream and baskets of blackberries had been set out, and the guests were </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sipping a sweet orange-scented wine from engraved silver cups.  <i>A fool’s festival</i>, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="401" height="22" font="2">Brynden had called it, and small wonder. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Across the terrace, Lysa laughed gaily at some jest of Lord Hunter’s, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">nibbled a blackberry from the point of Ser Lyn Corbray’s dagger. They were the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">suitors who stood highest in Lysa’s favor. . . today, at least. Catelyn would have </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">been hard-pressed to say which man was more unsuitable. Eon Hunter was even </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">older than Jon Arryn had been, half-crippled by gout, and cursed with three </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">quarrelsome sons, each more grasping than the last. Ser Lyn was a different sort of </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">folly; lean and handsome, heir to an ancient but impoverished house, but vain, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">reckless, hot-tempered. . . and, it was whispered, notoriously uninterested in the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">intimate charms of women. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When Lysa espied Catelyn, she welcomed her with a sisterly embrace and a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moist kiss on the cheek. “Isn’t it a lovely morning? The gods are smiling on us. Do </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">try a cup of the wine, sweet sister. Lord Hunter was kind enough to send for it, from </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">his own cellars.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="366" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, no. Lysa, we must talk.” </text>

<page number="347" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="679" height="22" font="2">“After,” her sister promised, already beginning to turn away from her. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Now.” Catelyn spoke more loudly than she’d intended. Men were turning to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">look. “Lysa, you cannot mean to go ahead with this folly. Alive, the Imp has value. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">Dead, he is only food for crows. And if his champion should prevail here—” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Small chance of that, my lady,” Lord Hunter assured her, patting her </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shoulder with a liver-spotted hand. “Ser Vardis is a doughty fighter. He will make </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="285" height="22" font="2">short work of the sellsword.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Will he, my lord?” Catelyn said coolly. “I wonder.” She had seen Bronn fight </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on the high road; it was no accident that he had survived the journey while other </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">men had died. He moved like a panther, and that ugly sword of his seemed a part of </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">his arm. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Lysa’s suitors were gathering around them like bees round a blossom. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">“Women understand little of these things,” Ser Morton Waynwood said. “Ser </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Vardis is a knight, sweet lady. This other fellow, well, his sort are all cowards at </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">heart. Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fellows around them, but </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="610" height="22" font="2">stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Say you have the truth of it, then,” Catelyn said with a courtesy that made </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her mouth ache. “What will we gain  by the dwarf’s death? Do you imagine that </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Jaime will care a fig that we gave his brother a  <i>trial</i>  before we flung him off a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="118" height="22" font="2">mountain?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“Behead the man,” Ser Lyn Corbray suggested. “When the Kingslayer </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="517" height="22" font="2">receives the Imp’s head, it will be a warning to him,” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Lysa gave an impatient shake of her waist-long auburn hair. “Lord Robert </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wants to see him fly,” she said, as if that settled the matter. “And the Imp has only </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">himself to blame. It was he who demanded a trial by combat.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Lady Lysa had no honorable way to deny him, even if she’d wished to,” Lord </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">Hunter intoned ponderously. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ignoring them all, Catelyn turned all her force on her sister. “I remind you, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="325" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister is <i>my</i> prisoner.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“And I remind  <i>you</i>,  the dwarf murdered my lord husband!” Her voice rose. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“He  poisoned the Hand of the King and left my sweet baby fatherless, and now I </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">mean to see him pay!” Whirling, her skirts swinging around her, Lysa stalked </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">across the terrace. Ser Lyn and Ser Morton and the other suitors excused themselves </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">with cool nods and trailed after her. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Do you think he did?” Ser Rodrik asked her quietly when they were alone </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="761" height="22" font="2">again. “Murder Lord Jon, that is? The Imp still denies it, and most fiercely. . .” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I believe the Lannisters murdered Lord Arryn,” Catelyn replied, “but whether </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it was Tyrion, or Ser Jaime, or the queen, or all of them together, I could not begin </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to say.” Lysa had named Cersei in the letter she had sent to Winterfell, but now she </text>
</page>
<page number="348" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seemed certain that Tyrion was the killer. . . perhaps because the dwarf was here, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">while the queen was safe behind the walls of the Red Keep, hundreds of leagues to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="812" height="22" font="2">the south. Catelyn almost wished she had burned her sister’s letter <i>before</i> reading it. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. “Poison, well. . . that could be the dwarf’s </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">work, true enough. Or Cersei’s. It’s said poison is a woman’s weapon, begging your </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pardons, my lady. The Kingslayer, now. . . I have no great liking for the man, but </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he’s not the sort. Too fond of the sight of blood on that golden sword of his. <i>Was</i> it </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="181" height="22" font="2">poison, my lady?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn frowned, vaguely uneasy. “How else could they make it look a natural </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">death?” Behind her, Lord Robert shrieked with delight as one of the puppet knights </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sliced the other in half, spilling a flood of red sawdust onto the terrace. She glanced </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">at her nephew and sighed. “The boy is utterly without discipline. He will never be </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="718" height="22" font="2">strong enough to rule unless he is taken away from his mother for a time.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“His lord father agreed with you,” said a voice at her elbow. She turned to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">behold Maester Colemon, a cup of wine in his hand. “He was planning to send the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">boy to Dragonstone for fostering, you know. . . oh, but I’m speaking out of turn.” </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The apple of his throat bobbed anxiously beneath the loose maester’s chain. “I fear </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I’ve had too much of Lord Hunter’s excellent wine. The prospect of bloodshed has </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">my nerves all a-fray. . .” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“You are mistaken, Maester,” Catelyn said. “It was Casterly Rock, not </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Dragonstone, and those arrangements were made after the Hand’s death, without </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">my sister’s consent.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The maester’s head jerked so vigorously at the end of his absurdly long neck </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that he looked half a puppet himself. “No, begging your forgiveness, my lady, but it </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">was Lord Jon who—” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A bell tolled loudly below them. High lords and serving girls alike broke off </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">what they were doing and moved to the balustrade. Below, two guardsmen in sky-</text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">blue cloaks led forth Tyrion Lannister. The Eyrie’s plump septon escorted him to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the statue in the center of the garden, a weeping woman carved in veined white </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">marble, no doubt meant to be Alyssa. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The bad little man,” Lord Robert said, giggling. “Mother, can I make him </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">fly? I want to see him fly.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="437" height="22" font="2">“Later, my sweet baby,” Lysa promised him. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="555" height="22" font="2">“Trial first,” drawled Ser Lyn Corbray, “<i>then </i>execution.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">A moment later the two champions appeared from opposite sides of the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">garden. The knight was attended by two young squires, the sellsword by the Eyrie’s </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">master-at-arms. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel, encased in heavy plate armor </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">over mail and padded surcoat. Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in </text>
</page>
<page number="349" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the moon-and-falcon sigil of House Arryn, protected the vulnerable juncture of arm </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and breast. A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh, while a </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">solid gorget encircled his throat. Falcon’s wings sprouted from the temples of his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="717" height="22" font="2">helm, and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfhelm </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a noseguard, and a mail coif. High leather boots with steel shinguards gave </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">some protection to his legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gloves. Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">with a longer reach. . . and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if she was any judge. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They knelt in the grass beneath the weeping woman, facing each other, with </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lannister between them. The septon removed a faceted crystal sphere from the soft </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cloth bag at his waist. He lifted it high above his head, and the light shattered. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Rainbows danced across the Imp’s face. In a high, solemn, singsong voice, the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">septon asked the gods to look down and bear witness, to find the truth in this man’s </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soul, to grant him life and freedom if he was innocent, death if he was guilty. His </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">voice echoed off the surrounding towers. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When the last echo had died away, the septon lowered his crystal and made a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hasty departure. Tyrion leaned over and whispered something in Bronn’s ear before </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the guardsmen led him away. The sellsword rose laughing and brushed a blade of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">grass from his knee. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Robert Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, was fidgeting </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">impatiently in his elevated chair. “When are they going to fight?” he asked </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">plaintively. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis was helped back to his feet by one of his squires. The other </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">brought him a triangular shield almost four feet tall, heavy oak dotted with iron </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">studs. They strapped it to his left forearm. When Lysa’s master-at-arms offered </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Bronn a similar shield, the sellsword spat and waved it away. Three days growth of </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">coarse black beard covered his jaw and cheeks, but if he did not shave it was not for </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">want of a razor; the edge of his sword had the dangerous glimmer of steel that had </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">been honed every day for hours, until it was too sharp to touch. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">double-edged longsword in his grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon’s head, its crossguard fashioned </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">into the shape of wings. “I had that sword crafted for Jon in King’s Landing,” Lysa </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">told her guests proudly as they watched Ser Vardis try a practice cut. “He wore it </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">whenever he sat the Iron Throne in King Robert’s place. Isn’t it a lovely thing? I </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="711" height="22" font="2">thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The engraved silver blade was beautiful beyond a doubt, but it seemed to </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Catelyn that Ser Vardis might have been more comfortable with his own sword. Yet </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="651" height="22" font="2">she said nothing; she was weary of futile arguments with her sister. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="425" height="22" font="2">“Make them fight!” Lord Robert called out. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis faced the Lord of the Eyrie and lifted his sword in salute. “For the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="204" height="22" font="2">Eyrie and the Vale!” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister had been seated on a balcony across the garden, flanked by </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="629" height="22" font="2">his guards. It was to him that Bronn turned with a cursory salute. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="595" height="22" font="2">“They await your command,” Lady Lysa said to her lord son. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="731" height="22" font="2">“<i>Fight!</i>” the boy screamed, his arms trembling as they clutched at his chair. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis swiveled, bringing up his heavy shield. Bronn turned to face him. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Their swords rang together, once, twice, a testing. The sellsword backed off a step. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The knight came after, holding his shield before him. He tried a slash, but Bronn </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">jerked back, just out of reach, and the silver blade cut only air. Bronn circled to his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">right. Ser Vardis turned to follow, keeping his shield between them. The knight </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pressed forward, placing each foot carefully on the uneven ground. The sellsword </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">gave way, a faint smile playing over his lips. Ser Vardis attacked, slashing, but </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Bronn leapt away from him, hopping lightly over a low, moss-covered stone. Now </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the sellsword circled left, away from the shield, toward the knight’s unprotected </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">side. Ser Vardis tried a hack at his legs, but he did not have the reach. Bronn danced </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">farther to his left. Ser Vardis turned in place. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The man is craven,” Lord Hunter declared. “Stand and fight, coward! “Other </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="282" height="22" font="2">voices echoed the sentiment. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Catelyn looked to Ser Rodrik. Her master-at-arms gave a curt shake of his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">head. “He wants to make Ser Vardis chase him. The weight of armor and shield will </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">tire even the strongest man.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She had seen men practice at their swordplay near every day of her life, had </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">viewed half a hundred tourneys in her time, but this was something different and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">deadlier: a dance where the smallest misstep meant death. And as she watched, the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">memory of another duel in another time came back to Catelyn Stark, as vivid as if it </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="196" height="22" font="2">had been yesterday. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They met in the lower bailey of Riverrun. When Brandon saw that Petyr wore </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">only helm and breastplate and mail, he took off most of his armor. Petyr had begged </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">her for a favor he might wear, but she had turned him away. Her lord father </text>

<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pressed it into his hand, she pleaded with him. “He is only a foolish boy, but I have </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">loved him like a brother. It would grieve me to see him die.” And her betrothed </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked at her with the cool grey eyes of a Stark and promised to spare the boy who </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="102" height="22" font="2">loved her. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That fight was over almost as soon as it began. Brandon was a man grown, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and he drove Littlefinger all the way across the bailey and down the water stair, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">raining steel on him with every step, until the boy was staggering and bleeding from </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a dozen wounds. “Yield!” he called, more than once, but Petyr would only shake his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">head and fight on, grimly. When the river was lapping at their ankles, Brandon </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">finally ended it, with a brutal backhand cut that bit through Petyr’s rings and leather </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into the soft flesh below the ribs, so deep that Catelyn was certain that the wound </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was mortal. He looked at her as he fell and murmured “Cat” as the bright blood </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">came flowing out between his mailed fingers. She thought she had forgotten that. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That was the last time she had seen his face. . . until the day she was brought </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="298" height="22" font="2">before him in King’s Landing. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A fortnight passed before Littlefinger was strong enough to leave Riverrun, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but her lord father forbade her to visit him in the tower where he lay abed. Lysa </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">helped their maester nurse him; she had been softer and shyer in those days. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Edmure had called on him as well, but Petyr had sent him away. Her brother had </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">acted as Brandon’s squire at the duel, and Littlefinger would not forgive that. As </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soon as he was strong enough to be moved, Lord Hoster Tully sent Petyr Baelish </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">away in a closed litter, to finish his healing on the Fingers, upon the windswept jut </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">of rock where he’d been born. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The ringing clash of steel on steel jarred Catelyn back to the present. Ser </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Vardis was coming hard at Bronn, driving into him with shield and sword. The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sellsword scrambled backward, checking each blow, stepping lithely over rock and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">root, his eyes never leaving his foe. He was quicker, Catelyn saw; the knight’s </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">silvered sword never came near to touching him, but his own ugly grey blade </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">hacked a notch from Ser Vardis’s shoulder plate. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The brief flurry of fighting ended as swiftly as it had begun when Bronn </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sidestepped and slid behind the statue of the weeping woman. Ser Vardis lunged at </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="709" height="22" font="2">where he had been, striking a spark off the pale marble of Alyssa’s thigh. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“They’re not fighting good, Mother,” the Lord of the Eyrie complained. “I </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="198" height="22" font="2">want them to <i>fight</i>.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“They will, sweet baby,” his mother soothed him. “The sellsword can’t run all </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">day.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Some of the lords on Lysa’s terrace were making wry jests as they refilled </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">their wine cups, but across the garden, Tyrion Lannister’s mismatched eyes watched </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="611" height="22" font="2">the champions dance as if there were nothing else in the world. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bronn came out from behind the statue hard and fast, still moving left, aiming </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">a two-handed cut at the knight’s unshielded right side. Ser Vardis blocked, but </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">clumsily, and the sellsword’s blade flashed upward at his head. Metal rang, and a </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">falcon’s wing collapsed with a crunch. Ser Vardis took a half step back to brace </text>
</page>
<page number="352" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">himself, raised his shield. Oak chips flew as Bronn’s sword hacked at the wooden </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wall. The sellsword stepped left again, away from the shield, and caught Ser Vardis </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">across the stomach, the razor edge of his blade leaving a bright gash when it bit into </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="179" height="22" font="2">the knight’s plate. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Vardis drove forward off his back foot, his own silver blade descending in </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a savage arc. Bronn slammed it aside and danced away. The knight crashed into the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">weeping woman, rocking her on her plinth. Staggered, he stepped backward, his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">head turning this way and that as he searched for his foe. The slit visor of his helm </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">narrowed his vision. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Behind you, ser!” Lord Hunter shouted, too late. Bronn brought his sword </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down with both hands, catching Ser Vardis in the elbow of his sword arm. The thin </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">lobstered metal that protected the joint crunched. The knight grunted, turning, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wrenching his weapon up. This time Bronn stood his ground. The swords flew at </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">each other, and their steel song filled the garden and rang off the white towers of the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">Eyrie. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“Ser Vardis is hurt,” Ser Rodrik said, his voice grave. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn did not need to be told; she had eyes, she could see the bright finger </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of blood running along the knight’s forearm, the wetness inside the elbow joint. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Every parry was a little slower and a little lower than the one before. Ser Vardis </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">turned his side to his foe, trying to use his shield to block instead, but Bronn slid </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">around him, quick as a cat. The sellsword seemed to be getting stronger. His cuts </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">were leaving their marks now. Deep shiny gashes gleamed all over the knight’s </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">armor, on his right thigh, his beaked visor, crossing on his breastplate, a long one </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">along the front of his gorget. The moon-and-falcon rondel over Ser Vardis’s right </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">arm was sheared clean in half, hanging by its strap. They could hear his labored </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="470" height="22" font="2">breath, rattling through the air holes in his visor. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Blind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could see what was happening below them, yet her sister could not. “Enough, Ser </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="763" height="22" font="2">Vardis!” Lady Lysa called down. “Finish him now, my baby is growing tired.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady’s </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">command, even to the last. One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">behind his scarred shield; the next he charged. The sudden bull rush caught Bronn </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">off balance. Ser Vardis crashed into him and slammed the lip of his shield into the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sellsword’s face. Almost, <i>almost</i>, Bronn lost his feet. . . he staggered back, tripped </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">over a rock, and caught hold of the weeping woman to keep his balance. Throwing </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">aside his shield, Ser Vardis lurched after him, using both hands to raise his sword. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">His right arm was blood from elbow to fingers now, yet his last desperate blow </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">would have opened Bronn from neck to navel. . . if the sellsword had stood to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">receive it. </text>
</page>
<page number="353" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">But Bronn jerked back. Jon Arryn’s beautiful engraved silver sword glanced </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">off the marble elbow of the weeping woman and snapped clean a third of the way </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">up the blade. Bronn put his shoulder into the statue’s back. The weathered likeness </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of Alyssa Arryn tottered and fell with a great crash, and Ser Vardis Egen went </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">down beneath her. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bronn was on him in a heartbeat, kicking what was left of his shattered rondel </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">aside to expose the weak spot between arm and breastplate. Ser Vardis was lying on </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his side, pinned beneath the broken torso of the weeping woman. Catelyn heard the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">knight groan as the sellsword lifted his blade with both hands and drove it down and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in with all his weight behind it, under the arm and through the ribs. Ser Vardis Egen </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="228" height="22" font="2">shuddered and lay still. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Silence hung over the Eyrie. Bronn yanked off his halfhelm and let it fall to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the grass. His lip was smashed and bloody where the shield had caught him, and his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">coal-black hair was soaked with sweat. He spit out a broken tooth. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="480" height="22" font="2">“Is it over, Mother?” the Lord of the Eyrie asked. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="545" height="22" font="4"><i>No</i>, Catelyn wanted to tell him, <i>it’s only now beginning</i>. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Lysa said glumly, her voice as cold and dead as the captain of her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">guard. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">“Can I make the little man fly now?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Across the garden, Tyrion Lannister got to his feet. “Not  <i>this</i>  little man,” he </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">said. “This little man is going down in the turnip hoist, thank you very much.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="302" height="22" font="2">“You presume—” Lysa began. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I presume that House Arryn remembers its own words,” the Imp said. “<i>As </i></text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="4"><i>High as Honor</i>.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You promised I could make him fly,” the Lord of the Eyrie screamed at his </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">mother. He began to shake. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lady Lysa’s face was flushed with fury. “The gods have seen fit to proclaim </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">him innocent, child. We have no choice but to free him.” She lifted her voice. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Guards. Take my lord of Lannister and his. . . <i>creature </i>here out of my sight. Escort </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them to the Bloody Gate and set them free. See that they have horses and supplies </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sufficient to reach the Trident, and make certain all their goods and weapons are </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="562" height="22" font="2">returned to them. They shall need them on the high road.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The high road,” Tyrion Lannister said. Lysa allowed herself a faint, satisfied </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">smile. It was another sort of death sentence, Catelyn realized. Tyrion Lannister must </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">know that as well. Yet the dwarf favored Lady Arryn with a mocking bow. “As you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="578" height="22" font="2">command, my lady,” he said. “I believe we know the way.” </text>

<text top="290" left="184" width="691" height="22" font="2">announced when they had all assembled in the yard. “Your hands </text>
<text top="318" left="184" width="689" height="22" font="2">were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine. But last night I was told that </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad. One or two may even be worth </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the price of piss. To make room for them, I have decided to pass eight of you on to </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Lord Commander to do with as he will.” He called out the names one by one. </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple. Monkey. Ser Loon.” Last, he looked </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">at Jon. “And the Bastard.” </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Pyp let fly a  <i>whoop</i>  and thrust his sword into the air. Ser Alliser fixed him </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a reptile stare. “They will call you men of Night’s Watch now, but you are </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bigger fools than the Mummer’s Monkey here if you believe that. You are boys </text>

<text top="621" left="54" width="618" height="22" font="2">flies.” And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took his leave of them. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cursing and offering congratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">of his sword and shouted, “Toad, of the Night’s Watch!” Yelling that a black </text>

<text top="787" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">returned with a skin of sour red. As they passed the wine from hand to hand, </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by himself beneath a bare </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">dead tree in the corner of the yard. Jon offered him the skin. “A swallow of wine?” </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="413" height="22" font="2">Sam shook his head. “No thank you, Jon.” </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="163" height="22" font="2">“Are you well?” </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Very well, truly,” the fat boy lied. “I am so happy for you all.” His round </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face quivered as he forced a smile. “You will be First Ranger someday, just as your </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">struggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="108" height="22" font="2">snowballs. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">By the time he wrenched free, with snow in his hair and wine stains on his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">occasion. When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led him </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to the bench near the fire. The older men clapped him on the arm in passing. The </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swimming in butter. “From the Lord Commander’s own table,” Bowen Marsh told </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="420" height="22" font="2">bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Do you think they’ll keep us together?” Pyp wondered as they gorged </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">themselves happily. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="719" height="22" font="2">Toad made a face. “I hope not. I’m sick of looking at those ears of yours.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Ho,” said Pyp. “Listen to the crow call the raven black. You’re certain to be a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ranger, Toad. They’ll want you as far from the castle as they can. If Mance Rayder </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="700" height="22" font="2">attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and he’ll run off screaming.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">Everyone laughed but Grenn. “I hope <i>I’m</i> a ranger.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“You and everyone else,” said Matthar. Every man who wore the black </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in its defense, but the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night’s Watch. It was they who dared </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">snow bears. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Not everyone,” said Halder. “It’s the builders for  me. What use would </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="333" height="22" font="2">rangers be if the Wall fell down?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Wall. Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">deep in the haunted forest, dragging them south on sledges so the Wall might be </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">raised ever higher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="511" height="22" font="2">or signs of melt and making what repairs they could. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Old Bear’s no fool,” Dareon observed. “You’re certain to be a builder, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Jon’s certain to be a ranger. He’s the best sword and the best rider among us, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and his uncle was the First before he. . .”  His voice trailed off awkwardly as he </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="325" height="22" font="2">realized what he had almost said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Benjen Stark is still First Ranger,” Jon Snow told him, toying with his bowl </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle’s safe return, but </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="780" height="22" font="2">not him. He pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="440" height="22" font="2">“Aren’t you going to eat those?” Toad asked. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“They’re yours.” Jon had hardly tasted Hobb’s great feast. “I could not eat </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">another bite.” He took his cloak from its hook near the door and shouldered his way </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">out. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="355" height="22" font="2">Pyp followed him. “Jon, what is it?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="492" height="22" font="2">“Sam,” he admitted. “He was not at table tonight.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It’s not like him to miss a meal,” Pyp said thoughtfully. “Do you suppose </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">he’s taken ill?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He’s frightened. We’re leaving him.” He remembered the day he had left </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in his </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hair, Arya raining kisses on him after he’d given her Needle. “Once we say our </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">words, we’ll all have duties to attend to. Some of us may be sent away, to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad. Gods only know </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">what they’ll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send them against him, first </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="163" height="22" font="2">chance he gets.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="450" height="22" font="2">Pyp made a grimace. “You did all you could.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="394" height="22" font="2">“All we could wasn’t enough,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A deep restlessness was on him as he went back to Hardin’s Tower for Ghost. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The direwolf walked beside him to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered. Jon saddled his mare, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raced ahead of him, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. Jon let him </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="262" height="22" font="2">go. A wolf needed to hunt. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He had no destination in mind. He wanted only to ride. He followed the creek </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the kingsroad. It stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of it filled Jon Snow with a vast </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">longing. Winterfell was down that road, and beyond it Riverrun and King’s Landing </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isle of Faces, the red </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">old Valyria. All the places that Jon would never see. The world was down that </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">road. . . and he was here. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Once he swore his vow, the Wall would be his home until he was old as </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon. “I have not sworn yet,” he muttered. He was no outlaw, bound to </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">take the black or pay the penalty for his crimes. He had come here freely, and he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">might leave freely. . . until he said the words. He need only ride on, and he could </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, he would be back in </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="278" height="22" font="2">Winterfell with his brothers. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Your <i>half</i> brothers, a voice inside reminded him.<i> And Lady Stark, who will not </i></text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>welcome you</i>. There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King’s Landing </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">either. Even his own mother had not had a place for him. The thought of her made </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him sad. He wondered who she had been, what she had looked like, why his father </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had left her. <i>Because she was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and </i></text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="4"><i>dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of her? </i></text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him. The fires of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="528" height="22" font="2">moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="495" height="22" font="2">He wheeled his horse around and started for home. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ghost returned as he crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the Lord Commander’s Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as he </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">trotted beside the horse. Jon found himself thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">ride back. By the time he reached the stables, he knew what he must do. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon’s apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Aged and frail, the maester shared his chambers with two of the younger stewards, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties. The brothers joked that he </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">had been given the two ugliest men in the Night’s Watch; being blind, he was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">spared having to look at them. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on his neck the size of a pigeon’s egg, and a face </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="754" height="22" font="2">red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why he always seemed so angry. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was Chett who answered Jon’s knock. “I need to speak to Maester Aemon,” </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="132" height="22" font="2">Jon told him. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The maester is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">he’ll see you.” He began to shut the door. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon jammed it open with his boot. “I need to speak to him now. The morning </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="166" height="22" font="2">will be too late.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Chett scowled. “The maester is not accustomed to being woken in the night. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">Do you know how old he is?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you,” Jon said. “Give </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="677" height="22" font="2">him my pardons. I would not disturb his rest if it were not important.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="179" height="22" font="2">“And if I refuse?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door. “I can stand here all night if I </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">must.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The black brother made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit him. </text>
</page>
<page number="358" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Wait in the library. There’s wood. Start a fire. I won’t have the maester catching a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">chill on account of you.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The old man was clad in his bed robe, but around his throat was the chain collar of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his order. A maester did not remove it even to sleep. “The chair beside the fire </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">would be pleasant,” he said when he felt the warmth on his face. When he was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="812" height="22" font="2">settled comfortably, Chett covered his legs with a fur and went to stand by the door. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="560" height="22" font="2">“I am sorry to have woken you, Maester,” Jon Snow said. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You did not wake me,” Maester Aemon replied. “I find I need less sleep as I </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">grow older, and I am grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday. The mystery of a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="282" height="22" font="2">calling at this strange hour?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">of the Night’s Watch.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="578" height="22" font="2">“This is no concern of Maester Aemon,” Chett complained. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Alliser Thorne,” the maester said gently. “Only he may say when a boy is ready to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="587" height="22" font="2">swear his vow, as you surely know. Why then come to me?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Lord Commander listens to you,” Jon told him. “And the wounded and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="484" height="22" font="2">the sick of the Night’s Watch are in your charge.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">“And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">“He will be,” Jon promised, “unless you help.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He told them all of it, even the part where he’d set Ghost at Rast’s throat. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett’s face </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">darkened with each word. “Without us to keep him safe, Sam will have no chance,” </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jon finished. “He’s <i>hopeless</i> with a sword. My sister Arya could tear him apart, and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she’s not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes him fight, it’s only a matter of time before </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="194" height="22" font="2">he’s hurt or killed.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Chett could stand no more. “I’ve seen this fat boy in the common hall,” he </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="707" height="22" font="2">said. “He <i>is</i> a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Maybe it is so,” Maester Aemon said. “Tell me, Chett, what would you have </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">us do with such a boy?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Leave him where he is,” Chett said. “The Wall is no place for the weak. Let </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">him train until he is ready, no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">make a man of him or kill him, as the gods will.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That’s  <i>stupid</i>,” Jon said. He took a deep breath to gather his thoughts. “I </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="2">remember once I asked Maester Luwin why he wore a chain around his throat.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon touched his own collar lightly, his bony, wrinkled finger </text>

<page number="359" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">stroking the heavy metal links. “Go on.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He told me that a maester’s collar is made of chain to remind him that he is </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sworn to serve,” Jon said, remembering. “I asked why each link was a different </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Luwin laughed. A maester forges his chain with study, he told me. The different </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft. And he said there were other </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">meanings as well. The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">serves, isn’t that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can’t make a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="511" height="22" font="2">sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="343" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon smiled. “And so?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Night’s Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and builders? Lord Randyll couldn’t make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won’t </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">either. You can’t hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat it, but that </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">doesn’t mean tin is useless. Why shouldn’t Sam be a steward?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Chett gave an angry scowl.  “<i>I’m  </i>a steward. You think it’s easy work, fit for </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals. Who do you think makes </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="685" height="22" font="2">your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="535" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon was gentler. “Is your friend a hunter?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="367" height="22" font="2">“He hates hunting,” Jon had to admit. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Can he plow a field?” the maester asked. “Can he drive a wagon or sail a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="312" height="22" font="2">ship? Could he butcher a cow?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="63" height="22" font="2">“No.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Chett gave a nasty laugh. “I’ve seen what happens to soft lordlings when </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they’re put to work. Set them to churning butter and their hands blister and bleed. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">Give them an axe to split logs, and they cut off their own foot.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="518" height="22" font="2">“I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="339" height="22" font="2">“Yes?” Maester Aemon prompted. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“He could help you,” he said quickly. “He can do sums, and he knows how to read </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and write. I know Chett can’t read, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in his father’s library. He’d be good with the ravens too. Animals seem to like him. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Ghost took to him straight off. There’s a lot he could do, besides fighting. The </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Night’s Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of him </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">instead.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon closed his eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that he </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="207" height="22" font="2">“Does that mean. . .” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It means I shall think on what you have said,” the maester told him firmly. </text>

<text top="262" left="122" width="753" height="22" font="2">hey had taken shelter beneath a copse of aspens just off the high road. </text>
<text top="290" left="122" width="756" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was gathering  deadwood while their horses took water from a </text>
<text top="318" left="122" width="749" height="22" font="2">mountain stream. He stooped to pick up a splintered branch and examined it </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="815" height="22" font="2">critically. “Will this do? I am not practiced at starting fires. Morrec did that for me.” </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A <i>fire</i>?” Bronn said, spitting. “Are you so hungry to die, dwarf? Or have you </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">taken leave of your senses? A fire will bring the clansmen down on us from miles </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">around. I mean to survive this journey, Lannister.” </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“And how do you hope to do that?” Tyrion asked. He tucked the branch under </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his arm and poked around through the sparse undergrowth, looking for more. His </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back ached from the effort of bending; they had been riding since daybreak, when a </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">stone-faced Ser Lyn Corbray had ushered them through the Bloody Gate and </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">commanded them never to return. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“We have no chance of fighting our way back,” Bronn said, “but two can </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cover more ground than ten, and attract less notice. The fewer days we spend in </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">these mountains, the more like we are to reach the riverlands. Ride hard and fast, I </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">say. Travel by night and hole up by day, avoid the road where we can, make no </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">noise and light no fires.” </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister sighed. “A splendid plan, Bronn. Try it, as you like. . . and </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">forgive me if I do not linger to bury you.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You think to outlive <i>me</i>, dwarf?” The sellsword grinned. He had a dark gap </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="805" height="22" font="2">in his smile where the edge of Ser Vardis Egen’s shield had cracked a tooth in half. </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion shrugged. “Riding hard and fast by night is a sure way to tumble down </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">a mountain and crack your skull. I prefer to make my crossing slow and  easy. I </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">know you love the taste of horse, Bronn, but if our mounts die under us this time, </text>

<text top="980" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">hand over the high, wind-carved crags that surrounded them. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="512" height="22" font="2">Bronn grimaced. “Then we’re dead men, Lannister.” </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“If so, I prefer to die comfortable,” Tyrion replied. “We need a fire. The </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I can find meat.” Beneath a fall of black hair, Bronn’s dark eyes regarded </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tyrion suspiciously. “I should leave you here with your fool’s fire. If I took your </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="516" height="22" font="2">“Die, most like.” Tyrion stooped to get another stick. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="275" height="22" font="2">“You don’t think I’d do it?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You’d do it in an instant, if it meant your life. You were quick enough to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">silence your friend Chiggen when he caught that arrow in his belly.” Bronn had </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yanked back the man’s head by the hair and driven the point of his dirk in under the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">ear, and afterward told Catelyn Stark that the other sellsword had died of his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">wound. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He was good as dead,” Bronn said, “and his moaning was bringing them </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down on us. Chiggen would have done the same for me. . . and he was no friend, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">only a man I rode with. Make no mistake, dwarf. I fought for you, but I do not love </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">you.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It was your blade I needed,” Tyrion said, “not your love.” He dumped his </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="301" height="22" font="2">armful of wood on the ground. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bronn grinned. “You’re bold as any sellsword, I’ll give you that. How did you </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="254" height="22" font="2">know I’d take your part?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Know?” Tyrion squatted awkwardly on his stunted legs to build the fire. “I </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tossed the dice. Back at the inn, you and Chiggen helped take me captive. Why? </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The others saw it as their duty, for the honor of the lords they served, but not you </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">two. You had no lord, no duty, and precious little honor, so why trouble to involve </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">yourselves?” He took out his knife and whittled some thin strips of bark off one of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">the sticks he’d gathered, to serve as kindling. “Well, why do sellswords do </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">anything? For gold. You were thinking Lady Catelyn would reward you for your </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">help, perhaps even take you into her service. Here, that should do, I hope. Do you </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">have a flint?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bronn slid two fingers into the pouch at his belt and tossed down a  flint. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">Tyrion caught it in the air. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My thanks,” he said. “The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is a proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that’s the most you could </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="671" height="22" font="2">Tyrion struck the flint against his dagger, trying for a spark. Nothing. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bronn snorted. “You have a bold tongue, little man. One day someone is like </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">to cut it out and make you eat it.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Everyone tells me that.” Tyrion glanced up at the sellsword. “Did I offend </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">you? My pardons. . . but you  <i>are</i>  scum, Bronn, make no mistake. Duty, honor, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">friendship, what’s that to you? No, don’t trouble yourself, we both know the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">answer. Still, you’re not stupid. Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">need of you. . . but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gold. When the moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">enough to know where your best interest lay. Happily for me, you did.” He </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">slammed stone and steel together again, fruitlessly. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Here,” said Bronn, squatting, “I’ll do it.” He took the knife and flint from </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="789" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s hands and struck sparks on his first try. A curl of bark began to smolder. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Well done,” Tyrion said. “Scum you may be, but you’re undeniably useful, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and with a sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you’ll have it.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leapt up higher. “And if you </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">die?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Why then, I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,” Tyrion said, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">grinning. “The gold ends when I do.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The fire was blazing up nicely. Bronn stood, tucked the flint back into his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pouch, and tossed Tyrion his dagger. “Fair enough,” he said. “My sword’s yours, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">then. . . but don’t go looking for me to bend the knee and  <i>m’lord</i>  you every time </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">you take a shit. I’m no man’s toady.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Nor any man’s friend,” Tyrion said. “I’ve no doubt you’d betray me as quick </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as you did Lady Stark, if you saw a profit in it. If the day ever comes when you’re </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tempted to sell me out, remember this, Bronn—I’ll match their price, whatever it is. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I <i>like</i> living. And now, do you think you could do something about finding us some </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">supper?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Take care of the horses,” Bronn said, unsheathing the long dirk he wore at </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">his hip. He strode into the trees. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">An hour later the horses had been rubbed down and fed, the fire was crackling </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">away merrily, and a haunch of a young goat was turning above the flames, spitting </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and hissing. “All we lack now is some good wine to wash down our kid,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“That, a woman, and another dozen swords,” Bronn said. He sat cross-legged </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">beside the fire, honing the edge of his longsword with an oilstone. There was </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh, I imagine they’ll be here long before it comes to sleep.” The smell of the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="415" height="22" font="2">roasting meat made Tyrion’s mouth water. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bronn watched him across the fire. “You have a plan,” he said flatly, with a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">scrape of steel on stone. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="554" height="22" font="2">“A hope, call it,” Tyrion said. “Another toss of the dice.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="292" height="22" font="2">“With our lives as the stake?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion shrugged. “What choice do we have?” He leaned over the fire and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sawed a thin slice of meat from the kid. “Ahhhh,” he sighed happily as he chewed. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Grease ran down his chin. “A bit tougher than I’d like, and in want of spicing, but </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">I’ll not complain too loudly. If I were back at the Eyrie, I’d be dancing on a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">precipice in hopes of a boiled bean.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="584" height="22" font="2">“And yet you gave the turnkey a purse of gold,” Bronn said. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">“A Lannister always pays his debts.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Even Mord had scarcely believed it when Tyrion tossed him the leather purse. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The gaoler’s eyes had gone big as boiled eggs as he yanked open the drawstring and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beheld the glint of gold. “I kept the silver,” Tyrion had told him with a crooked </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">smile, “but you were promised the gold, and there it is.” It was more than  a man </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">like Mord could hope to earn in a lifetime of abusing prisoners. “And remember </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">what I said, this is only a taste. If you ever grow tired of Lady Arryn’s service, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">present yourself at Casterly Rock, and I’ll pay you the rest of what I owe you.” </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">With golden dragons spilling out of both hands, Mord had fallen to his knees and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="351" height="22" font="2">promised that he would do just that. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Bronn yanked out his dirk and pulled the meat from the fire. He began to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">carve thick chunks of charred meat off the bone as Tyrion hollowed out two heels </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of stale bread to serve as trenchers. “If we do reach the river, what will you do </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">then?” the sellsword asked as he cut. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh, a whore and a featherbed and a flagon of wine, for a start.” Tyrion held </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">out his trencher, and Bronn filled it with meat.  “And then to Casterly Rock or </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">King’s Landing, I think. I have some questions that want answering, concerning a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">certain dagger.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The sellsword chewed and swallowed. “So you were telling it true? It was not </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">your knife?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="461" height="22" font="2">Tyrion smiled thinly. “Do I look a liar to you?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">By the time their bellies were full, the stars had come out and a halfmoon was </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rising over the mountains. Tyrion spread his shadowskin cloak on the ground and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">stretched out with his saddle for a pillow. “Our friends are taking their sweet time.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If I were them, I’d fear a trap,” Bronn said. “Why else would we be so open, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">if not to lure them in?” </text>
</page>
<page number="365" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion chuckled. “Then we ought to sing and send them fleeing in terror.” He </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">began to whistle a tune. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You’re mad, dwarf,” Bronn said as he cleaned the grease out from under his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">nails with his dirk. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="378" height="22" font="2">“Where’s your love of music, Bronn?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If it was music you wanted, you should have gotten the singer to champion </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">you.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion grinned. “That would have been amusing. I can just see him fending </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">off Ser Vardis with his woodharp.” He resumed his whistling. “Do you know this </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="168" height="22" font="2">song?” he asked. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">“You hear it here and there, in inns and whorehouses.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Myrish. ‘The Seasons of My Love.’ Sweet and sad, if you understand the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">words. The first girl I ever bedded used to sing it, and I’ve never been able to put it </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">out of my head.” Tyrion gazed up at the sky. It was a clear cold night and the stars </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shone down upon the mountains as bright and merciless as truth. “I met her on a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">night like this,” he heard himself saying. “Jaime and I were riding back from </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lannisport when we heard a scream, and she came running out into the road with </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">two men dogging her heels, shouting threats. My brother unsheathed his sword and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">went after them, while I dismounted to protect the girl. She was scarcely a year </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">older than I was, dark-haired, slender, with a face that would break your heart. It </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">certainly broke mine. Lowborn, half-starved, unwashed. . . yet lovely. They’d torn </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the rags she was wearing half off her back, so I wrapped her in my cloak while </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jaime chased the men into the woods. By the time he came trotting back, I’d gotten </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a name out of her, and a story. She was a crofter’s child, orphaned when her father </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="516" height="22" font="2">died of fever, on her way to. . . well, nowhere, really. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Jaime was all in a lather to hunt down the men. It was not often outlaws </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dared prey on travelers so near to Casterly Rock, and he took it as an insult. The girl </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was too frightened to send off by herself, though, so I offered to take her to the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">closest inn and feed her while my brother rode back to the Rock for help. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“She was hungrier than I would have believed. We finished two whole </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">chickens and part of a third, and drank a flagon of wine, talking. I was only thirteen, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the wine went to my head, I fear. The next thing I knew, I was sharing her bed. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">If she was shy, I was shyer. I’ll never know where I found the courage. When I </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">broke her maidenhead, she wept, but afterward she kissed me and sang her little </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="361" height="22" font="2">song, and by morning I was in love.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="347" height="22" font="2">“<i>You?</i>” Bronn’s voice was amused. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Absurd, isn’t it?” Tyrion began to whistle the song again. “I married her,” he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="165" height="22" font="2">finally admitted. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“A Lannister of Casterly Rock wed to a crofter’s daughter,” Bronn said. “How </text>

<page number="366" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="223" height="22" font="2">did you manage that?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh, you’d be astonished at what a boy can make of a few lies, fifty pieces of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">silver, and a drunken septon. I dared not bring my bride home to Casterly Rock, so I </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">set her up in a cottage of her own, and for a fortnight we played at being man and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wife. And then the septon sobered and confessed all to my lord father.” Tyrion was </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">surprised at how desolate it made him feel to say it, even after all these years. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Perhaps he was just tired. “That was the end of my marriage.” He sat up and stared </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">at the dying fire, blinking at the light. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="242" height="22" font="2">“He sent the girl away?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He did better than that,” Tyrion said. “First he made my brother tell me the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">truth. The girl was a whore, you see. Jaime arranged the whole affair, the road, the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">outlaws, all of it. He thought it was time I had a woman. He paid double for a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">maiden, knowing it would be my first time. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“After Jaime had made his confession, to drive home the lesson, Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brought my wife in and gave her to his guards. They paid her fair enough. A silver </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">for each man, how many whores command that high a price? He sat me down in the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">corner of the barracks and bade me watch, and at the end she had so many silvers </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on the floor, she. . .”  The </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">smoke was stinging his eyes. Tyrion cleared his throat and turned away from the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fire, to gaze out into darkness. “Lord Tywin had me go last,” he said in a quiet </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">voice. “And he gave me a gold coin to pay her, because I was a Lannister, and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">worth more.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">After a time he heard the noise again, the rasp of steel on stone as Bronn </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sharpened his sword. “Thirteen or thirty or three, I would have killed the man who </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">did that to me.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Tyrion swung around to face him. “You may get that chance one day. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Remember what I told you. A Lannister always pays his debts.” He yawned. “I </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="562" height="22" font="2">think I will try and sleep. Wake me if we’re about to die.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He rolled himself up in the shadowskin and shut his eyes. The ground was </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stony and cold, but after a time Tyrion Lannister did sleep. He dreamt of the sky </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cell. This time he was the gaoler, not the prisoner, <i>big</i>, with a strap in his hand, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="622" height="22" font="2">he was hitting his father, driving him back, toward the abyss. . .  </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="465" height="22" font="2">“<i>Tyrion</i>.” Bronn’s warning was low and urgent. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was awake in the blink of an eye. The fire had burned down to embers, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the shadows were creeping in all around them. Bronn had raised himself to one </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">knee, his sword in one hand and his dirk in the other. Tyrion held up a hand: <i>stay </i></text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>still</i>, it said. “Come share our fire, the night is cold,” he called out to the creeping </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shadows. “I fear we’ve no wine to offer  you, but you’re welcome to some of our </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">goat.” </text>
</page>
<page number="367" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">All movement stopped. Tyrion saw the glint of moonlight on metal. “Our </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mountain,” a voice called out from the trees, deep and hard and unfriendly. “Our </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">goat.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">“Your goat,” Tyrion agreed. “Who are you?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“When you meet your gods,” a different voice replied, “say it was Gunthor </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">son of Gurn of the Stone Crows who sent you to them.” A branch cracked underfoot </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">as he stepped into the light; a thin man in a horned helmet, armed with a long knife. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“And Shagga son of Dolf.” That was the first voice, deep and deadly. A </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">boulder shifted to their left, and stood, and became a man. Massive and slow and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">strong he seemed, dressed all in skins, with a club in his right hand and an axe in his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="526" height="22" font="2">left. He smashed them together as he lumbered closer. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Other voices called other names, Conn and Torrek and Jaggot and more that </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion forgot the instant he heard them; ten at least. A few had swords and knives; </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">others brandished pitchforks and scythes and wooden spears. He waited until they </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were done shouting out their names before he gave them answer. “I am Tyrion son </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of Tywin, of the Clan Lannister, the Lions of the Rock. We will gladly pay you for </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">the goat we ate.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“What do you have to give us, Tyrion son of Tywin?” asked the one who </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">named himself Gunthor, who seemed to be their chief. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“There is silver in my purse,” Tyrion told them. “This hauberk I wear is large </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for me, but it should fit Conn nicely, and the battle-axe I carry would suit Shagga’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">mighty hand far better than that wood-axe he holds.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="579" height="22" font="2">“The halfman would pay us with our own coin,” said Conn. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Conn speaks truly,” Gunthor said. “Your silver is ours. Your horses are ours. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Your hauberk and your battle-axe and the knife at your belt, those are ours too. You </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have nothing to give us but your lives. How would you like to die, Tyrion son of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">Tywin?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“In my own bed, with a belly full of wine and a maiden’s mouth around my </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">cock, at the age of eighty,” he replied. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The huge one, Shagga, laughed first and loudest. The others seemed less </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">amused. “Conn, take their horses,” Gunthor commanded. “Kill the other and seize </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="635" height="22" font="2">the halfman. He can milk the goats and make the mothers laugh.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="417" height="22" font="2">Bronn sprang to his feet. “Who dies first?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>No!</i>” Tyrion said sharply. “Gunthor son of Gurn, hear me. My House is rich </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and powerful. If the Stone Crows will see us safely through these mountains, my </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="2">lord father will shower you with gold.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The gold of a lowland lord is as worthless as a halfman’s promises,” Gunthor </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">said. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Half a man I may be,” Tyrion said, “yet I have the courage to face my </text>

<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">beneath him had grown harder by the hour, and the fanged steel behind made it </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">impossible to lean back.  <i>A king should never sit easy</i>,  Aegon the Conqueror had </text>

<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Rise,” Ned commanded the villagers. He never trusted what a man told him </text>

<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">In ones and twos, the holdfast of Sherrer struggled to its feet. One ancient </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">needed to be helped, and a young girl in a bloody dress stayed on her knees, staring </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">blankly at Ser Arys Oakheart, who stood by the foot of the throne in the white </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">armor of the Kingsguard, ready to protect and defend the king. . . or, Ned supposed, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">the King’s Hand. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Joss,” Ser Raymun Darry said to a plump balding man in a brewer’s apron. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="416" height="22" font="2">“Tell the Hand what happened at Sherrer.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="384" height="22" font="2">Joss nodded. “If it please His Grace—” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“His Grace is hunting across the Blackwater,” Ned said, wondering how a </text>

<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">notion what his king looked like. Ned was clad in a white linen doublet with the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">direwolf of Stark on the breast; his black wool cloak was fastened at the collar by </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his silver hand of office. Black and white and grey, all  the shades of truth. “I am </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lord Eddard Stark, the King’s Hand. Tell me who you are and what you know of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="143" height="22" font="2">these raiders.” </text>

<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">m’lord. It’s gone now like all the rest, m’lord. They come and drank their fill and </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“They burnt us out,” a farmer beside him said. “Come riding in the dark, up </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">from the south, and fired the fields and the houses alike, killing them as tried to stop </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and forth across the fields on their horses, poking at him with their lances like it was </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a game, them laughing and the boy stumbling and screaming till the big one pierced </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">him clean through.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The girl on her knees craned her head up at Ned, high above her on the throne. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“They killed my mother too, Your Grace. And they. . . they. . .”  Her voice trailed </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">off, as if she had forgotten what she was about to say. She began to sob. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Raymun Darry took up the tale. “At Wendish Town, the people sought </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shelter in their holdfast, but the walls were timbered. The raiders piled straw against </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the wood and burnt them all alive. When the Wendish folk opened their gates to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">flee the fire, they shot them down with arrows as they came running  out, even </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="290" height="22" font="2">women with suckling babes.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="584" height="22" font="2">“Oh, dreadful,” murmured Varys. “How cruel can men be?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“They would of done the same for us, but the Sherrer holdfast’s made of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stone,” Joss said. “Some wanted to smoke us out, but the big one said there was </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">riper fruit upriver, and they made for the Mummer’s Ford.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward. Between </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">each finger was a blade, the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">arms of the throne. Even after three centuries, some were still sharp enough to cut. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">The Iron Throne was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had taken a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thousand blades to make it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Black Dread. The hammering had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was this </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hunched black beast made of razor edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal; a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="656" height="22" font="2">chair that could kill a man, and had, if the stories could be believed. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">What Eddard Stark was doing sitting there he would never comprehend, yet </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there he sat, and these people looked to him for justice. “What proof do you have </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that these were Lannisters?” he asked, trying to keep his fury under control. “Did </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">they wear crimson cloaks or fly a lion banner?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Even Lannisters are not so blind stupid as that,” Ser Marq Piper snapped. He </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was a swaggering bantam rooster of a youth, too young and too hot-blooded for </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">Ned’s taste, though a fast friend of Catelyn’s brother, Edmure Tully. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Every man among them was mounted and mailed, my lord,” Ser Karyl </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">answered calmly. “They were armed with steel-tipped lances and longswords, with </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">battle-axes for the butchering.” He gestured toward one of the ragged survivors. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">“You. Yes, you, no one’s going to hurt you. Tell the Hand what you told me.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The old man bobbed his head. “Concerning their horses,” he said, “it were </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">warhorses they rode. Many a year I worked in old Ser Willum’s stables, so I knows </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the difference. Not a one of these ever pulled a plow, gods bear witness if I’m </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">wrong.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“Well-mounted brigands,” observed Littlefinger. “Perhaps they stole the </text>

<page number="372" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="2">horses from the last place they raided.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="605" height="22" font="2">“How many men were there in this raiding party?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A hundred, at the least,” Joss answered, in the same instant as the bandaged </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">smith  said, “Fifty,” and the grandmother behind him, “Hunnerds and hunnerds, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">m’lord, an army they was.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“You are more right than you know, goodwoman,” Lord Eddard told her. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“You say they flew no banners. What of the armor they wore? Did any of you note </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="527" height="22" font="2">ornaments or decorations, devices on shield or helm?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The brewer, Joss, shook his head. “It grieves me, m’lord, but no, the armor </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they showed us was plain, only. . . the one who led them, he was armored like the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rest, but there was no mistaking him all the same. It was the size of him, m’lord. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Those as say the giants are all dead never saw this one, I swear. Big as an ox he </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">was, and a voice like stone breaking.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>The Mountain!</i>” Ser Marq said loudly. “Can any man doubt it? This was </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="248" height="22" font="2">Gregor Clegane’s work.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned heard muttering from beneath the windows and the far end of the hall. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Even in the galley, nervous whispers were exchanged. High lords and smallfolk </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">alike knew what it could mean if Ser Marq was proved right. Ser Gregor Clegane </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">stood bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He studied the frightened faces of the villagers. Small wonder they had been </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">so fearful; they had thought they were being dragged here to name Lord Tywin a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">red-handed butcher before a king who was his son by marriage. He wondered if the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">knights had given them a choice. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle rose ponderously from the council table, his chain of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">office clinking. “Ser Marq, with respect, you cannot know that this outlaw was Ser </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">Gregor. There are many large men in the realm.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“As large as the Mountain That Rides?” Ser Karyl said. “I have never met </text>

<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Nor has any man here,” Ser Raymun added hotly. “Even his brother is a pup </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand?” Pycelle asked. “By the grace of his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">liege lord, he holds a stout keep and lands of his own. The man is an anointed </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">knight.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="573" height="22" font="2">“A false knight!” Ser Marq said. “Lord Tywin’s mad dog.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My lord Hand,” Pycelle declared in a stiff voice, “I urge you to remind this </text>

<text top="1080" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, Grand Maester Pycelle,” Ned said. “I fear we might have </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forward. “Ser Marq, Ser Karyl, Ser Raymun—perhaps I might ask you a question? </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">These holdfasts were under your protection. Where were you when all this </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="401" height="22" font="2">slaughtering and burning was going on?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Karyl Vance answered. “I was attending my lord father in the pass below </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Golden Tooth, as was Ser Marq. When the word of these outrages reached Ser </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Edmure Tully, he sent word that we should take a small force of men to find what </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">survivors we could and bring them to the king.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Ser Raymun Darry spoke up. “Ser Edmure had summoned me to Riverrun </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with all my strength. I was camped across the river from his walls, awaiting his </text>

<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Clegane and his vermin were back across the Red Fork, riding for Lannister’s hills.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger stroked the point of his beard thoughtfully. “And if they come </text>

<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If they come again, we’ll use their blood to water the fields they burnt,” Ser </text>

<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Edmure has sent men to every village and holdfast within a day’s ride of </text>

<text top="887" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">Tywin Lannister was shrewd enough to know that. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“If your fields and holdfasts are safe from harm,” Lord Petyr was saying, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">“what then do you ask of the throne?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The lords of the Trident keep the king’s peace,” Ser Raymun Darry said. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“The Lannisters have broken it. We ask leave to answer them, steel for steel. We </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Thank the gods for old Lord Hoster, then</i>. Tywin Lannister was as much fox </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as lion. If indeed he’d sent Ser Gregor to burn and pillage—and Ned did not doubt </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">that he had—he’d taken care to see that he  rode under cover of night, without </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">banners, in the guise of a common brigand. Should Riverrun strike back, Cersei and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her father would insist that it had been the Tullys who broke the king’s peace, not </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="620" height="22" font="2">the Lannisters. The gods only knew what Robert would believe. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle was on his feet again. “My lord Hand, if these good </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">folk believe that Ser Gregor has forsaken his holy vows for plunder and rape, let </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them go to his liege lord and make their complaint. These crimes are no concern of </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">the throne. Let them seek Lord Tywin’s justice.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It is all the king’s justice,” Ned told him. “North, south, east, or west, all we </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="282" height="22" font="2">do we do in Robert’s name.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The <i>king’s</i> justice,” Grand Maester Pycelle said. “So it is, and so we should </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“The king is hunting across the river and may not return for days,” Lord </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Eddard said. “Robert bid me to sit here in his place, to listen with his ears, and to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">speak with his voice. I mean to do just that. . . though I agree that he must be told.” </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">He saw a familiar face beneath the tapestries. “Ser Robar.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="559" height="22" font="2">Ser Robar Royce stepped forward and bowed. “My lord.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Your father is hunting with the king,” Ned said. “Will you bring them word </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">of what was said and done here today?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="196" height="22" font="2">“At once, my lord.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Do we have your leave to take our vengeance against Ser Gregor, then?” </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">Marq Piper asked the throne. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Vengeance?” Ned said. “I thought we were speaking of justice. Burning </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Clegane’s fields and slaughtering his people will not restore the king’s peace, only </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">your injured pride.” He glanced away before the young knight could voice his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">outraged protest, and addressed the villagers. “People of Sherrer, I cannot give you </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">back your  homes or your crops, nor can I restore your dead to life. But perhaps I </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">can give you some small measure of justice, in the name of our king, Robert.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Every eye in the hall was fixed on him, waiting. Slowly Ned struggled to his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet, pushing himself up from the throne with the strength of his arms, his shattered </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">leg screaming inside its cast. He did his best to ignore the pain; it was no moment to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">let them see his weakness. “The First Men believed that the judge who called for </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">death should wield the sword, and in the north we hold to that still. I mislike </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sending another to do my killing . . . yet it seems I have no choice.” He gestured at </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="148" height="22" font="2">his broken leg. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Lord Eddard!</i>” The shout came from the west side of the hall as a handsome </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stripling of a boy strode forth  boldly. Out of his armor, Ser Loras Tyrell looked </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">even younger than his sixteen years. He wore pale blue silk, his belt a linked chain </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of golden roses, the sigil of his House. “I beg you the honor of acting in your place. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="607" height="22" font="2">Give this task to me, my lord, and I swear I shall not fail you.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger chuckled. “Ser Loras, if we send you off alone, Ser Gregor will </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">send us back your head with a plum stuffed in that pretty mouth of yours. The </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">Mountain is not the sort to bend his neck to any man’s justice.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="556" height="22" font="2">“I do not fear Gregor Clegane,” Ser Loras said haughtily. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned eased himself slowly back onto the hard iron seat of Aegon’s misshapen </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">throne. His eyes searched the faces along the wall. “Lord Beric,” he called out. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Thoros of Myr. Ser Gladden. Lord Lothar.” The men named stepped forward one </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">by one. “Each of you is to assemble twenty men, to bring my word to Gregor’s </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">keep. Twenty of my own guards shall go with you. Lord Beric Dondarrion, you </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">shall have the command, as befits your rank.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">The young lord with the red-gold hair bowed. “As you command, Lord </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">Eddard.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned raised his voice, so it carried to the far end of the throne room. “In the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the Realm, by the word of Eddard of the House Stark, his Hand, I charge you to ride </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to the westlands with all haste, to cross the Red Fork of the Trident under the king’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">flag, and there bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane, and to all </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him, and attaint him, and strip him of all </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">rank and titles, of all lands and incomes and holdings, and do sentence him to death. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">May the gods take pity on his soul.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When the echo of his words had died away, the Knight of Flowers seemed </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">perplexed. “Lord Eddard, what of me?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned looked down on him. From on high, Loras Tyrell seemed almost as </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">young as Robb. “No one doubts your valor, Ser Loras, but we are about justice here, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and what you seek is vengeance.” He looked back to Lord Beric. “Ride at first light. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">These things are best done quickly.” He held up a hand. “The throne will hear no </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="220" height="22" font="2">more petitions today.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Alyn and Porther climbed the steep iron steps to help him back down. As they </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">made their descent, he could feel Loras Tyrell’s sullen stare, but the boy had stalked </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="530" height="22" font="2">away before Ned reached the floor of the throne room. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">At the base of the Iron Throne, Varys was gathering papers from the council </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">table. Littlefinger and Grand Maester Pycelle had already taken their leave. “You </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="554" height="22" font="2">are a bolder man than I, my lord,” the eunuch said softly. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“How so, Lord Varys?” Ned asked brusquely. His leg was throbbing, and he </text>

<page number="376" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="321" height="22" font="2">was in no mood for word games. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Had it been me up there, I should have sent Ser Loras. He  <i>so</i>  wanted to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">go. . . and a man who has the Lannisters for his enemies would do well to make the </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="776" height="22" font="2">“Ser Loras is young,” said Ned. “I daresay he will outgrow the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">disappointment.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“And Ser Ilyn?” The eunuch stroked a plump, powdered cheek. “He  <i>is</i>  the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">King’s Justice, after all. Sending other men to do his office. . . some might construe </text>

<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No slight was intended.” In truth, Ned did not trust the mute knight, though </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">perhaps that was only because he misliked executioners. “I remind you, the Paynes </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">are bannermen to House Lannister. I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="176" height="22" font="2">Tywin no fealty.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Very prudent, no doubt,” Varys said. “Still, I chanced to see Ser Ilyn in the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back of the hall, staring at us with those pale eyes of his, and I must say, he did not </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">look pleased, though to be sure it is hard to tell with our silent knight. I hope he </text>

<text top="456" left="54" width="459" height="22" font="2">Sansa’s own age. “Did Ser Loras hurt his leg?” </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Not <i>his</i> leg,” Sansa said, nibbling delicately at a chicken leg. “<i>Father’s </i>leg, </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">silly. It hurts him ever so much, it makes him cross. Otherwise I’m certain he would </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">have sent Ser Loras.” </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Her father’s decision still bewildered her. When the Knight of Flowers had </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spoken up, she’d been sure she was about to see one of Old Nan’s stories come to </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">life. Ser Gregor was the monster and Ser Loras the true hero who would slay him. </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">He even  <i>looked</i>  a true hero, so slim and beautiful, with golden roses around his </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slender waist and his rich brown hair tumbling down into his eyes. And then Father </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had <i>refused</i> him! It had upset her more than she could tell. She had said as much to </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane as they descended the stairs from the gallery, but the septa had only </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">told her it was not her place to question her lord father’s decisions. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">That was when Lord Baelish had said, “Oh, I don’t know, Septa. Some of her </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lord father’s decisions could do with a bit of questioning. The young lady is as wise </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as she is lovely.” He made a sweeping bow to Sansa, so deep she was not quite sure </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">if she was being complimented or mocked. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane had been <i>very</i> upset to realize that Lord Baelish had overheard </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them. “The girl was just talking, my lord,” she’d said. “Foolish chatter. She meant </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">nothing by the comment.” </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Lord Baelish stroked his little pointed beard and said, “Nothing? Tell me, </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">child, why would you have sent Ser Loras?” </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Sansa had no choice but to explain about heroes and monsters. The king’s </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">councillor smiled. “Well, those are not the reasons I’d have given, but. . .” He had </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">touched her cheek, his thumb lightly tracing the line of a cheekbone. “Life is not a </text>

<page number="378" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">song, sweetling. You may learn that one day to your sorrow.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa did not feel like telling all that to Jeyne, however; it made her uneasy </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">just to think back on it. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Ser Ilyn’s the King’s Justice, not Ser Loras,” Jeyne said. “Lord Eddard </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="226" height="22" font="2">should have sent him.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa shuddered. Every time she looked at Ser Ilyn Payne, she shivered. He </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">made her feel as though something dead were slithering over her naked skin. “Ser </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="678" height="22" font="2">Ilyn’s almost like a <i>second</i> monster. I’m glad Father didn’t pick him.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="739" height="22" font="2">“Lord Beric is as much a hero as Ser Loras. He’s ever so brave and gallant.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I suppose,” Sansa said doubtfully. Beric Dondarrion was handsome enough, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but he was awfully <i>old</i>, almost twenty-two; the Knight of Flowers would have been </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">much better. Of course, Jeyne had been in love with Lord Beric ever since she had </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">first glimpsed him in the lists. Sansa thought she was being silly; Jeyne was only a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">steward’s daughter, after all, and no matter how much she mooned after him, Lord </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Beric would never look at someone so far beneath him, even if she hadn’t been half </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">his age. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It would have been unkind to say so, however, so Sansa took a sip of milk and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">changed the subject. “I had a dream that Joffrey would be the one to take the white </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hart,” she said. It had been more of a wish, actually, but it sounded better to call it a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dream. Everyone knew that dreams were prophetic. White harts were supposed to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">be very rare and magical, and in her heart she knew her gallant prince was worthier </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">than his drunken father. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“A dream? Truly? Did Prince Joffrey just go up to it and touch it with his bare </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">hand and do it no harm?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No,” Sansa said. “He shot it with a golden arrow and brought it back for me.” </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">In the songs, the knights never killed magical beasts, they just went up to them and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">touched them and did them no harm, but she knew Joffrey liked hunting, especially </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the killing part. Only animals, though. Sansa was certain her prince had no part in </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">murdering Jory and those other poor men; that had been his wicked uncle, the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Kingslayer. She knew her father was still angry about that, but it wasn’t fair to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">blame Joff. That would be like blaming her for something that Arya had done. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I saw your sister this afternoon,” Jeyne blurted out, as if she’d been reading </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Sansa’s thoughts. “She was walking through the stables on her hands. Why would </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">she do a thing like that?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I’m sure I don’t know why Arya does anything.” Sansa hated stables, smelly </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">places full of manure and flies. Even when she went riding, she liked the boy to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">saddle the horse and bring it to her in the yard. “Do you want to hear about the court </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">or not?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="183" height="22" font="2">“I do,” Jeyne said. </text>
</page>
<page number="379" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“There was a black brother,” Sansa said, “begging men for the Wall, only he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was kind of old and smelly.” She hadn’t liked that at all. She had always imagined </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Night’s Watch to be men like Uncle Benjen. In the songs, they were called the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">black knights of the Wall. But this man had been crookbacked and hideous, and he </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looked as though he might have lice. If this was what the Night’s Watch was truly </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">like, she felt sorry for her bastard half brother, Jon. “Father asked if there were any </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knights in the hall who would do honor to their houses by taking the black, but no </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one came forward, so he gave this Yoren his pick of the king’s dungeons and sent </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him on his way. And later these two brothers came before him, freeriders from the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Dornish Marches, and pledged their swords to the service of the king. Father </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">accepted their oaths. . .” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="441" height="22" font="2">Jeyne yawned. “Are there any lemon cakes?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Sansa did not like being interrupted, but she had to admit, lemon cakes </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sounded more interesting than most of what had gone on in the throne room. “Let’s </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="142" height="22" font="2">see,” she said. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">The kitchen yielded no lemon cakes, but they did find half of a cold </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">strawberry pie, and that was almost as good. They ate it on the tower steps, giggling </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and gossiping and sharing secrets, and Sansa went to bed that night feeling almost </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">as wicked as Arya. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The next morning she woke before first light and crept sleepily to her window </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to watch Lord Beric form up his men. They rode out as dawn was breaking over the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">city, with three banners going before them; the crowned stag of the king flew from </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the high staff, the direwolf of Stark and Lord Beric’s own forked lightning standard </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from shorter poles. It was all so exciting, a song come to life; the clatter of swords, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">the flicker of torchlight, banners dancing in the wind, horses snorting and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whinnying, the golden glow of sunrise slanting through the bars of the portcullis as </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">it jerked upward. The Winterfell men looked especially fine in their silvery mail </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">and long grey cloaks. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Alyn carried the Stark banner. When she saw him rein in beside Lord Beric to </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">exchange words, it made Sansa feel ever so proud. Alyn was handsomer than Jory </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="456" height="22" font="2">had been; he was going to be a knight one day. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Tower of the Hand seemed so empty after they left that Sansa was even </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pleased to see Arya when she went down to break her fast. “Where is everyone?” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her sister wanted to know as she ripped the skin from a blood orange. “Did Father </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="417" height="22" font="2">send them to hunt down Jaime Lannister?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa sighed. “They rode with Lord Beric, to behead Ser Gregor Clegane.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">She turned to Septa Mordane, who was eating porridge with a wooden spoon. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“Septa, will Lord Beric spike Ser Gregor’s head on his own gate or bring it back </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="753" height="22" font="2">here for the king?” She and Jeyne Poole had been arguing over that last night. </text>
</page>
<page number="380" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The septa was horror-struck. “A lady does not discuss such things over her </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">porridge. Where are your courtesies, Sansa? I swear, of late you’ve been near as bad </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">as your sister.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="351" height="22" font="2">“What did Gregor do?” Arya asked. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“He burned down a holdfast and murdered a lot of people, women and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="138" height="22" font="2">children too.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya screwed up her face in a scowl. “Jaime Lannister murdered Jory and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Heward and Wyl, and the Hound murdered Mycah. Somebody should have </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="166" height="22" font="2">beheaded <i>them</i>.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It’s not the same,” Sansa said. “The Hound is Joffrey’s sworn shield. Your </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="341" height="22" font="2">butcher’s boy attacked the prince.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Liar,” Arya said. Her hand clenched the blood orange so hard that red juice </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">oozed between her fingers. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Go ahead, call me all the names you want,” Sansa said airily. “You won’t </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">dare when I’m married to Joffrey. You’ll have to bow to me and call me Your </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Grace.” She shrieked as Arya flung the orange across the table. It caught her in the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="702" height="22" font="2">middle of the forehead with a wet squish and plopped down into her lap. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="534" height="22" font="2">“You have juice on your face, Your Grace,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was running down her nose and stinging her eyes. Sansa wiped it away with </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a napkin. When she saw what the fruit in her lap had done to her beautiful ivory silk </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">dress, she shrieked again. “You’re  <i>horrible</i>,” she screamed at her sister. “They </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">should have killed <i>you</i> instead of Lady!” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane came lurching to her feet. “Your lord father will hear of this! </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">Go to your chambers, at once. <i>At once!</i>” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="565" height="22" font="2">“Me too?” Tears welled in Sansa’s eyes. “That’s not fair.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="445" height="22" font="2">“The matter is not subject to discussion. Go!” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa stalked away with her head up. She was to be a queen, and queens did </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">not cry. At least  not where people could see. When she reached her bedchamber, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she barred the door and took off her dress. The blood orange had left a blotchy red </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stain on the silk. “I  <i>hate</i>  her!” she screamed. She balled up the dress and flung it </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into the cold hearth, on top of the ashes of last night’s fire. When she saw that the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stain had bled through onto her underskirt, she began to sob despite herself. She </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ripped off the rest of her clothes wildly, threw herself into bed, and cried herself </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">back to sleep. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was midday when Septa Mordane knocked upon her door. “Sansa. Your </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">lord father will see you now.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa sat up. “Lady,” she whispered. For a moment it was as if the direwolf </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was there in the room, looking at her with those golden eyes, sad and knowing. She </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">had been dreaming, she realized. Lady was with her, and they were running </text>
</page>
<page number="381" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">together, and. . . and. . . trying to remember was like trying to catch the rain with </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">her fingers. The dream faded, and Lady was dead again. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="564" height="22" font="2">“Sansa.” The rap came again, sharply. “Do you hear me?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes, Septa,” she called out. “Might I have a moment to dress, please?” Her </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">eyes were red from crying, but she did her best to make herself beautiful. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Eddard was bent over a huge leather-bound book when Septa Mordane </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">marched her into the solar, his plaster-wrapped leg stiff beneath the table. “Come </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">here, Sansa,” he said, not unkindly, when the septa had gone for her sister. “Sit </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="316" height="22" font="2">beside me.” He closed the book. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Septa Mordane returned with Arya squirming in her grasp. Sansa had put on a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">lovely pale green  damask gown and a look of remorse, but her sister was still </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wearing the ratty leathers and roughspun she’d worn at breakfast. “Here is the other </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">one,” the septa announced. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My thanks, Septa Mordane. I would talk to my daughters alone, if you would </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Arya started it,” Sansa said quickly, anxious to have the first word. “She </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">called me a liar and threw an orange at me and spoiled my dress, the ivory silk, the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one Queen Cersei gave me when I was betrothed to Prince Joffrey. She hates that </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I’m going to marry the prince. She tries to spoil <i>everything</i>, Father, she can’t stand </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="471" height="22" font="2">for anything to be beautiful or nice or splendid.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="647" height="22" font="2">“<i>Enough</i>, Sansa.” Lord Eddard’s voice was sharp with impatience. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya raised her eyes. “I’m sorry, Father. I was wrong and I beg my sweet </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">sister’s forgiveness.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa was so startled that for a moment she was speechless. Finally she found </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="342" height="22" font="2">her voice. “What about my dress?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="489" height="22" font="2">“Maybe. . . I could wash it,” Arya said doubtfully. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Washing won’t do any good,” Sansa said. “Not if you scrubbed all day and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">all night. The silk is ruined.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="456" height="22" font="2">“Then I’ll. . . make you a new one,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa threw back her head in disdain. “<i>You? </i>You couldn’t sew a dress fit to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="188" height="22" font="2">clean the pigsties.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Their father sighed. “I did not call you here to talk of dresses. I’m sending you </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="246" height="22" font="2">both back to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">For the second time Sansa found herself too stunned for words. She felt her </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="227" height="22" font="2">eyes grow moist again. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="235" height="22" font="2">“You <i>can’t</i>,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="543" height="22" font="2">“Please, Father,” Sansa managed at last. “Please don’t.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark favored his daughters with a tired smile. “At last we’ve found </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I didn’t do anything wrong,” Sansa pleaded with him. “I don’t want to go </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">back.” She loved King’s Landing; the pageantry  of the court, the high lords and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ladies in their velvets and silks and gemstones, the great city with all its people. The </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tournament had been the most magical time of her whole life, and there was so </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">much she had not seen yet, harvest feasts and masked balls and mummer shows. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">She could not bear the  thought of losing it all. “Send Arya away, she started it, </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Father’s mouth twitched strangely. “Sansa, I’m not sending you away for </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya was chewing at her lip in that disgusting way she had. “Can we take </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">Syrio back with us?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Who cares about your stupid <i>dancing master</i>?” Sansa flared. “Father, I only </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">just now remembered, I can’t go away, I’m to marry Prince Joffrey.” She tried to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smile bravely for him. “I love him, Father, I truly truly do, I love him as much as </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Queen Naerys loved Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, as much as Jonquil loved Ser </text>

<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Sweet one,” her father said gently, “listen to me. When you’re old enough, I </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">will make you a match with a high lord who’s worthy of you, someone brave and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gentle and strong. This match with Joffrey was a terrible mistake. That boy is no </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">Prince Aemon, you must believe me.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He <i>is!</i>” Sansa insisted. “I don’t want someone brave and gentle, I want <i>him</i>. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">We’ll be ever so happy, just like in the songs, you’ll see. I’ll give him a son with </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">golden hair, and one day he’ll be the king of all the realm, the greatest king that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="543" height="22" font="2">ever was, as brave as the wolf and as proud as the lion.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Arya made a face. “Not if Joffrey’s his father,” she said. “He’s a liar and a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="419" height="22" font="2">craven and anyhow he’s a stag, not a lion.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Sansa felt tears in her eyes. “He is  <i>not!</i>  He’s not the least bit like that old </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="698" height="22" font="2">drunken king,” she screamed at her sister, forgetting herself in her grief. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Father looked at her strangely. “<i>Gods</i>,” he swore softly, “out of the mouth of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">babes. . .” He shouted for Septa Mordane. To the girls he said, “I am looking for a </text>

<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa cried as Septa Mordane marched them down the steps. They were going </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to take it all away; the tournaments and the court and her prince, everything, they </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were going to send her back to the bleak grey walls of Winterfell and lock her up </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">forever. Her life was over before it had begun. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stop that weeping, child,” Septa Mordane said sternly. “I am certain your </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It won’t be so bad, Sansa,” Arya said. “We’re going to sail on a galley. It will </text>

<text top="373" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Pycelle set a stoppered flask on the table by the bed. “The milk of the poppy, </text>

<text top="511" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Pycelle smiled wanly. “It is good to see you in such a fierce humor, my lord.” </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He leaned close and lowered his voice. “There was a raven this morning, a letter for </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">the queen from her lord father. I thought you had best know.” </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="566" height="22" font="2">“Dark wings, dark words,” Ned said grimly. “What of it?” </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Lord Tywin is greatly wroth about the men you sent after Ser Gregor </text>

<text top="704" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Let him be wroth,” Ned said. Every time his leg throbbed, he remembered </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister’s smile, and Jory dead in his arms. “Let him write all the letters to </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the queen he likes. Lord Beric rides beneath the king’s own banner. If Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">attempts to interfere with the king’s justice, he will have Robert to answer to. The </text>

<text top="869" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Pycelle pulled back, his maester’s chain jangling. “As you say. I shall visit </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="582" height="22" font="2">“Inflamed and painful, with an itch that is driving me mad.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. “In future, try not to let any horses fall on it. I </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Is there word of the king?” Ned demanded. “Just how long does Robert </text>

<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Given his preferences, I believe he’d stay in the forest until you and the </text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">For a brief moment Ned considered telling him all of it, but there was </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">something in Littlefinger’s japes that irked him. The man was too clever by half, a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mocking smile never far from his lips. “Jon Arryn was studying this volume when </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">he was taken sick,” Ned said in a careful tone, to see how he might respond. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">And he responded as he always did: with a quip. “In that case,” he said, “death </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="798" height="22" font="2">must have come as a blessed relief.” Lord Petyr Baelish bowed and took his leave. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark allowed himself a curse. Aside from his own retainers, there was </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">scarcely a man in this city he trusted. Littlefinger had concealed Catelyn and helped </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ned in his inquiries, yet his haste to save his own skin when Jaime and his swords </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had come out of the rain still rankled. Varys was worse. For all his protestations of </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">loyalty, the eunuch knew too much and did too little. Grand Maester Pycelle </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">seemed more Cersei’s creature with every passing day, and Ser Barristan was an old </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">man, and rigid. He would tell Ned to do his duty. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Time was perilously short. The king would return from his hunt soon, and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">honor would require Ned to go to him with all he had learned. Vayon Poole had </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">arranged for Sansa and Arya to sail on the <i>Wind Witch</i> out of Braavos, three days </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hence. They would be back at Winterfell before the harvest. Ned could no longer </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="495" height="22" font="2">use his concern for their safety to excuse his delay. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Yet last night he had dreamt of Rhaegar’s children. Lord Tywin had laid the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bodies beneath the Iron Throne, wrapped in the crimson cloaks of his house guard. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">That was clever of him; the blood did not show so badly against the red cloth. The </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">little princess had been barefoot, still dressed in her bed gown, and the boy. . . the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="78" height="22" font="2">boy. . .  </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned could not let that happen again. The realm could not withstand a second </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mad king, another dance of blood and vengeance. He must find some way to save </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="126" height="22" font="2">the children. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robert could be merciful. Ser Barristan was scarcely the only man he had </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pardoned. Grand Maester Pycelle, Varys the Spider, Lord Balon Greyjoy; each had </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">been counted an enemy to Robert once, and each had been welcomed into </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">friendship and allowed to retain honors and office for a pledge of fealty. So long as </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a man was brave and honest, Robert would treat him with all the honor and respect </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">due a valiant enemy. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">This was something else: poison in the dark, a knife thrust to the soul. This he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could never forgive, no more than he had forgiven Rhaegar.  <i>He will kill them all</i>, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">Ned realized. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And yet, he knew he could not keep silent. He had a duty to Robert, to the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">realm, to the shade of Jon Arryn. . . and to Bran, who surely must have stumbled on </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="653" height="22" font="2">some part of the truth. Why else would they have tried to slay him? </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Late that afternoon he summoned Tomard, the portly guardsman with the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">ginger-colored whiskers his children called Fat Tom. With Jory dead and Alyn </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gone, Fat Tom had command of his household guard. The thought filled Ned with </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">vague disquiet. Tomard was a solid man; affable, loyal, tireless, capable in a limited </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">way, but he was near fifty, and even in his youth he had never been energetic. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Perhaps Ned should not have been so quick to send off half his guard, and all his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">best swords among them. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I shall require your help,” Ned said when Tomard appeared, looking faintly </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">apprehensive, as he always did when called before his lord. “Take me to the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">godswood.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="502" height="22" font="2">“Is that wise, Lord Eddard? With your leg and all?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="292" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps not. But necessary.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tomard summoned Varly. With one arm around each man’s shoulders, Ned </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">managed to descend the steep tower steps and hobble across the bailey. “I want the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">guard doubled,” he told Fat Tom. “No one enters or leaves the Tower of the Hand </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">without my leave.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tom blinked. “M’lord, with Alyn and the others away, we are hard-pressed </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">already—” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“It will only be a short while. Lengthen the watches.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="581" height="22" font="2">“As you say, m’lord,” Tom answered. “Might I ask why—” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="333" height="22" font="2">“Best not,” Ned answered crisply. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The godswood was empty, as it always was here in this citadel of the southron </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gods. Ned’s leg was screaming as they lowered him to the grass beside the heart </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tree. “Thank you.” He drew a paper from his sleeve, sealed with the sigil of his </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="361" height="22" font="2">House. “Kindly deliver this at once.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tomard looked at the name Ned had written on the paper and licked his lips </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="2">anxiously. “My lord. . .” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="335" height="22" font="2">“Do as I bid you, Tom,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">How long he waited in the quiet of the godswood, he could not say. It was </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">peaceful here. The thick walls shut out the clamor of the castle, and he could hear </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">birds singing, the murmur of crickets, leaves rustling in a gentle wind. The heart </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tree was an oak, brown and faceless, yet Ned Stark still felt the presence of his </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">gods. His leg did not seem to hurt so much. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She came to him at sunset, as the clouds reddened above the walls and towers. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">She came alone, as he had bid her. For once she was dressed simply, in leather </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">boots and hunting greens. When she drew back the hood of her brown cloak, he saw </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the bruise where the king had struck her. The angry plum color had faded to yellow, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the swelling was down, but there was no mistaking it for anything but what it </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">was. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="576" height="22" font="2">“Why here?” Cersei Lannister asked as she stood over him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="221" height="22" font="2">“So the gods can see.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She sat beside him on the grass. Her every move was graceful. Her curling </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blond hair moved in the wind, and her eyes were green as the leaves of summer. It </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had  been a long time since Ned Stark had seen her beauty, but he saw it now. “I </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="461" height="22" font="2">know the truth Jon Arryn died for,” he told her. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Do you?” The queen watched his face, wary as a cat. “Is that why you called </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">me here, Lord Stark? To pose me riddles? Or is it your intent to seize me, as your </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="248" height="22" font="2">wife seized my brother?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“If you truly believed that, you would never have come.” Ned touched her </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="399" height="22" font="2">cheek gently. “Has he done this before?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Once or twice.” She shied away from his hand. “Never on the face before. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Jaime would have killed him, even if it meant his own life.” Cersei looked at him </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="564" height="22" font="2">defiantly. “My brother is worth a hundred of your friend.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="428" height="22" font="2">“Your brother?” Ned said. “Or your lover?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Both.” She did not flinch from the truth. “Since we were children together. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">And why not? The Targaryens wed brother to sister for three hundred years, to keep </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the bloodlines pure. And Jaime and I are more than brother and sister. We are one </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">person in two bodies. We shared a womb together. He came into this world holding </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my foot, our old maester said. When he is in me, I feel. . . whole.” The ghost of a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">smile flitted over her lips. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="183" height="22" font="2">“My son Bran. . .” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">To her credit, Cersei did not look away. “He saw us. You love your children, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">do you not?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robert had asked him the very same question, the morning of the melee. He </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">gave her the same answer. “With all my heart.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="250" height="22" font="2">“No less do I love mine.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned thought, <i>If it came to that, the life of some child I did not know, against </i></text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>Robb and Sansa and Arya and Bran and Rickon, what would I do? Even more so, </i></text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>what would</i> Catelyn <i>do, if it were Jon’s life, against the children of her body? </i>He </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="404" height="22" font="2">did not know. He prayed he never would. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="523" height="22" font="2">“All three are Jaime’s,” he said. It was not a question. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="181" height="22" font="2">“Thank the gods.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>The seed is strong</i>, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and so it was. All </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">those bastards, all with hair as black as night. Grand Maester Malleon recorded the </text>

<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">haired. No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages, always </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="414" height="22" font="2">he found the gold yielding before the coal. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A dozen years,” Ned said. “How is it that you have had no children by the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">king?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She lifted her head, defiant. “Your Robert got me with child once,” she said, </text>

<text top="501" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">usually so drunk that he’s forgotten it all by the next morning.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">How could they have all been so blind? The truth was there in front of them </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">all the time, written on the children’s faces. Ned felt sick. “I remember Robert as he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was the day he took the throne, every inch a king,” he said quietly. “A thousand </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">other women might have loved him with all their hearts. What did he do to make </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="180" height="22" font="2">you hate him so?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her eyes burned, green fire in the dusk, like the lioness that was her sigil. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“The night of our wedding feast, the first time we shared a bed, he called me by </text>

<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark thought of pale blue roses, and for a moment he wanted to weep. “I </text>

<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The queen seemed amused by that. “Save your pity for yourself, Lord Stark. I </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Must?</i>” She put her hand on his good leg, just above the knee. “A true man </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">does what he will, not what he must.” Her fingers brushed lightly against his thigh, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the gentlest of promises. “The realm needs a strong Hand. Joff will not come of age </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“For a start,” said Ned, “I do not kill children. You would do well to listen, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">my lady. I shall say this only once. When the king returns from his hunt, I intend to </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lay the truth before him. You must be gone by then. You and your children, all </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">three, and not to Casterly Rock. If I were you, I should take ship for the Free Cities, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">or even farther, to the Summer Isles or the Port of Ibben. As far as the winds blow.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="455" height="22" font="2">“Exile,” she said. “A bitter cup to drink from.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A sweeter cup than your father served Rhaegar’s children,” Ned said, “and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kinder than you deserve. Your father and your brothers would do well to go with </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you. Lord Tywin’s gold will buy you comfort and hire swords to keep you safe. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">You shall need them. I promise you, no matter where you flee, Robert’s wrath will </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">follow you, to the back of beyond if need be.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The queen stood. “And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?” she asked softly. Her </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">eyes searched his face. “You should have taken the realm for yourself. It was there </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">for the taking. Jaime told me how you found him on the Iron Throne the day King’s </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Landing fell, and made him yield it up. That was your moment. All you needed to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">do was climb those steps, and sit. Such a sad mistake.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I have made more mistakes than you can possibly imagine,” Ned said, “but </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">that was not one of them.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Oh, but it was, my lord,” Cersei insisted. “When you play the game of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="553" height="22" font="2">thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She turned up her hood to hide her swollen face and left him there in the dark </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">beneath the oak, amidst the quiet of the godswood, under a blue-black sky. The </text>

<text top="318" left="122" width="751" height="22" font="2">bloodriders knelt on the sand beside the corpse of the wild stallion, stone </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">knives in their hands. The stallion’s blood looked black in the flickering orange </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">glare of the torches that ringed the high chalk walls of the pit. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany touched the soft swell of her belly. Sweat beaded her skin and trickled </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down her brow. She could feel the old women watching her, the ancient crones of </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Vaes Dothrak, with eyes that shone dark as polished flint in their wrinkled faces. </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She must not flinch or look afraid. <i>I am the blood of the dragon</i>, she told herself as </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she took the stallion’s heart in both hands, lifted it to her mouth, and plunged her </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">teeth into the tough, stringy flesh. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Warm blood filled her mouth and ran down over her chin. The taste threatened </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to gag her, but she made herself chew and swallow. The heart of a stallion would </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">make her son strong and swift and fearless, or so the Dothraki believed, but only if </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the mother could eat it all. If she choked on the blood or retched up the flesh, the </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">omens were less favorable; the child might be stillborn, or come forth weak, </text>

<text top="731" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her handmaids had helped her ready herself for the ceremony. Despite the </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tender mother’s stomach that had afflicted her these past two moons, Dany had </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dined on bowls of half-clotted blood to accustom herself to the taste, and Irri made </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">her chew strips of dried horseflesh until her jaws were aching. She had starved </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">herself for a day and a night before the ceremony in the hopes that hunger would </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">help her keep down the raw meat. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The wild stallion’s heart was all muscle, and Dany had to worry it with her </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">teeth and chew each mouthful a long time. No steel was permitted within the sacred </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">confines of Vaes Dothrak, beneath the shadow of the Mother of Mountains; she had </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to rip the heart apart with teeth and nails. Her stomach roiled and heaved, yet she </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kept on, her face smeared with the heartsblood that sometimes seemed to explode </text>

<text top="1063" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo stood over her as she ate, his face as hard as a bronze shield. His </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">long black braid was shiny with oil. He wore gold rings in his mustache, gold bells </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">chest was bare. She looked at him whenever she felt her strength failing; looked at </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him, and chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed, chewed and swallowed. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">Toward the end, Dany thought she glimpsed a fierce pride in his dark, almond-</text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shaped eyes, but she could not be sure. The  <i>khal</i>’s  face did not often betray the </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">And finally it was done. Her cheeks and fingers were sticky as she forced </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">down the last of it. Only then did she turn her eyes back to the old women, the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="262" height="22" font="2">crones of the <i>doshkhaleen</i>. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khalakka dothrae mr’anha!</i>” she proclaimed in her best Dothraki.  <i>A prince </i></text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="781" height="22" font="4"><i>rides inside me!</i> She had practiced the phrase for days with her handmaid Jhiqui. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The oldest of the crones, a bent and shriveled stick of a woman with a single </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">black eye, raised her arms on high. “<i>Khalakka dothrae!</i>” she shrieked. <i>The prince is </i></text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="4"><i>riding! </i></text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>He is riding!</i>” the other women answered. “<i>Rakh! Rakh! Rakh haj!</i>” they </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="384" height="22" font="2">proclaimed. <i>A boy, a boy, a strong boy</i>. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Bells rang, a sudden clangor of bronze birds. A deep-throated warhorn </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sounded its long low note. The old women began to chant. Underneath their painted </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leather vests, their withered dugs swayed back and forth, shiny with oil and sweat. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The eunuchs who served them threw bundles of dried grasses into a great bronze </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brazier, and clouds of fragrant smoke rose up toward the moon and the stars. The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Dothraki believed the stars were horses made of fire, a great herd that galloped </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="232" height="22" font="2">across the sky by night. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">As the smoke ascended, the chanting died away and the ancient crone closed </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her single eye, the better to peer into the future. The silence that fell was complete. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dany could hear the distant call of night birds, the hiss and crackle of the torches, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the gentle lapping of water from the lake. The Dothraki stared at her with eyes of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">night, waiting. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo laid his hand on Dany’s arm. She could feel the tension in his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fingers. Even a  <i>khal</i>  as mighty as Drogo could know fear when the  <i>doshkhaleen</i> </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="776" height="22" font="2">peered into smoke of the future. At her back, her handmaids fluttered anxiously. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Finally the crone opened her eye and lifted her arms. “I have seen his face, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="749" height="22" font="2">and heard the thunder of his hooves,” she proclaimed in a thin, wavery voice. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="485" height="22" font="2">“The thunder of his hooves!” the others chorused. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“As swift as the wind he rides, and behind him his <i>khalasar</i> covers the earth, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">men without number, with <i>arakhs</i> shining in their hands like blades of razor grass. </text>

<page number="393" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">woman trembled and looked at Dany almost as if she were afraid. “The prince is </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>The stallion who mounts the world!</i>” the onlookers cried in echo, until the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">night rang to the sound of their voices. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The one-eyed crone peered at Dany. “What shall he be called, the stallion who </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="195" height="22" font="2">mounts the world?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She stood to answer. “He shall be called Rhaego,” she said, using the words </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">that Jhiqui had taught her. Her hands touched the swell beneath her breasts </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">protectively as a roar went up from the Dothraki. “<i>Rhaego</i>,” they screamed. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">“<i>Rhaego, Rhaego, Rhaego!</i>” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The name was still ringing in her ears as Khal Drogo led her from the pit. His </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bloodriders fell in behind them. A procession followed them out onto the godsway, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the broad grassy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of the  <i>doshkhaleen</i>  came first, with </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">horselord. Each of the old women had been a  <i>khaleesi</i>  once. When their lord </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">husbands died and a new <i>khal</i> took his place at the front of his riders, with a new </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>khaleesi</i>  mounted beside him, they were sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">nation. Even the mightiest of  <i>khals</i>  bowed to the wisdom and authority of the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>doshkhaleen</i>. Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">to join them, whether she willed it or no. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Behind the wise women came the others; Khal Ogo and his son, the <i>khalakka</i> </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Fogo, Khal Jommo and his wives, the chief men of Drogo’s  <i>khalasar</i>,  Dany’s </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">handmaids, the  <i>khal</i>’s servants and slaves, and more. Bells rang and drums beat a </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stately cadence as they marched along the godsway. Stolen heroes and the gods of </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dead peoples brooded in the darkness beyond the road. Alongside the procession, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">slaves ran lightly through the grass with torches in their hands, and the flickering </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="519" height="22" font="2">flames made the great monuments seem almost alive. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“What is meaning, name Rhaego?” Khal Drogo asked as they walked, using </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She had been teaching him a few </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">words when she could. Drogo was quick to learn when he put his mind to it, though </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">his accent was so thick and barbarous that neither Ser Jorah nor Viserys could </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="262" height="22" font="2">understand a word he said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“My brother Rhaegar was a fierce warrior, my sun-and-stars,” she told him. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="765" height="22" font="2">“He died before I was born. Ser Jorah says that he was the last of the dragons.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo looked down at her. His face was a copper mask, yet under the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">long black mustache, drooping beneath the weight of its gold rings, she thought she </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">glimpsed the shadow of a smile. “Is good name, Dan Ares wife, moon of my life,” </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">he said. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They rode to the lake the Dothraki called the Womb of the World, surrounded </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">by a fringe of reeds, its water still and calm. A thousand thousand years ago, Jhiqui </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">told her, the first man had emerged from its depths, riding upon the back of the first </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">horse. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The procession waited on the grassy shore as Dany stripped and let her soiled </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">clothing fall to the ground. Naked, she stepped gingerly into the water. Irri said the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">lake had no bottom, but Dany felt soft mud squishing between her toes as she </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pushed through the tall reeds. The moon floated on the still black waters, shattering </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and re-forming as her ripples washed over it. Goose pimples rose on her pale skin </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as the coldness crept up her thighs and kissed her lower lips. The stallion’s blood </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had dried on her hands and around her mouth. Dany cupped her fingers and lifted </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the sacred waters over her head, cleansing herself and the child inside her while the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>khal</i>  and the others looked on. She heard the old women of the  <i>doshkhaleen</i> </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="763" height="22" font="2">muttering to each other as they watched, and wondered what they were saying. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">When she emerged from the lake, shivering and dripping, her handmaid </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Doreah hurried to her with a robe of painted sandsilk, but Khal Drogo waved her </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">away. He was looking on her swollen breasts and the curve of her belly with </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">approval, and Dany could see the shape of his manhood pressing through his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">horsehide trousers, below the heavy gold medallions of his belt. She went to him </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and helped him unlace. Then her huge <i>khal</i> took her by the hips and lifted her into </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="612" height="22" font="2">the air, as he might lift a child. The bells in his hair rang softly. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany wrapped her arms around his shoulders and pressed her face against his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">neck as he thrust himself inside her. Three quick strokes and it was done. “<i>The </i></text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>stallion who mounts the world</i>,” Drogo whispered hoarsely. His hands still smelled </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of horse blood. He bit at her throat, hard, in the moment of his pleasure, and when </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he lifted her off, his seed filled her and trickled down the inside of her thighs. Only </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">then was Doreah permitted to drape her in the scented sandsilk, and Irri to fit soft </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">slippers to her feet. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo laced himself up and spoke a command, and horses were brought </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to the lakeshore. Cohollo had the honor of helping the  <i>khaleesi</i>  onto her silver. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Drogo spurred his stallion, and set off down the godsway beneath the moon and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="417" height="22" font="2">stars. On her silver, Dany easily kept pace. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The silk tenting that roofed Khal Drogo’s hall had been rolled up tonight, and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the moon followed them inside. Flames leapt ten feet in the air from three huge </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stone-lined firepits. The air was thick with the smells of roasting meat and curdled, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fermented mare’s milk. The hall was crowded and noisy when they entered, the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cushions packed with those whose rank and name were not sufficient to allow them </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at the ceremony. As Dany rode beneath the arched entry and up the center aisle, </text>
</page>
<page number="395" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">every eye was on her. The Dothraki screamed out comments on her belly and her </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">breasts, hailing the life within her. She could not understand all they shouted, but </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">one phrase came clear. “<i>The stallion that mounts the world</i>,” she heard, bellowed in </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">a thousand voices. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The sounds of drums and horns swirled up into the night. Half-clothed women </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">spun and danced on the low tables, amid joints of meat and platters piled high with </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">plums and dates and pomegranates. Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare’s </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">milk, yet Dany knew no  <i>arakhs</i>  would clash tonight, not here in the sacred city, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">where blades and bloodshed were forbidden. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo dismounted and took his place on the high bench. Khal Jommo </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and Khal Ogo, who had been in Vaes Dothrak with their  <i>khalasars</i>  when they </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">arrived, were given seats of high honor to Drogo’s right and left. The bloodriders of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">the three <i>khals</i> sat below them, and farther down Khal Jommo’s four wives. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany climbed off her silver and gave the reins to one of the slaves. As Doreah </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Irri arranged her cushions, she searched for her brother. Even across the length </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">of the crowded hall, Viserys should have been conspicuous with his pale skin, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="635" height="22" font="2">silvery hair, and beggar’s rags, but she did not see him anywhere. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Her glance roamed the crowded tables near the walls, where men whose </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">braids were even shorter than their manhoods sat on frayed rugs and flat cushions </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around the low tables, but all the faces she saw had black eyes and copper skin. She </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spied Ser Jorah Mormont near the center of the hall, close to the middle firepit. It </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">was a place of respect, if not high honor; the Dothraki esteemed the knight’s </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">prowess with a sword. Dany sent Jhiqui to bring him to her table. Mormont came at </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">once, and went to one knee before her. “<i>Khaleesi</i>,” he said, “I am yours to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">command.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="731" height="22" font="2">She patted the stuffed horsehide cushion beside her. “Sit and talk with me.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You honor me.” The knight seated himself cross-legged on the  cushion. A </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">slave knelt before him, offering a wooden platter full of ripe figs. Ser Jorah took </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="206" height="22" font="2">one and bit it in half. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Where is my brother?” Dany asked. “He ought to have come by now, for the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">feast.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I saw His Grace this morning,” he told her. “He told me he was going to the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="354" height="22" font="2">Western Market, in search of wine.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Wine?” Dany said doubtfully. Viserys could not abide the taste of the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fermented mare’s milk the Dothraki drank, she knew that, and he was oft at the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bazaars these days, drinking with the traders who came in the great caravans from </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">east and west. He seemed to find their company more congenial than hers. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Wine,” Ser Jorah confirmed, “and he has some thought to recruit men for his </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">army from the sellswords who guard the caravans.” A serving girl laid a blood pie </text>
</page>
<page number="396" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">in front of him, and he attacked it with both hands. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Is that wise?” she asked. “He has no gold to pay soldiers. What if he’s </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">betrayed?” Caravan guards were seldom troubled much by thoughts of honor, and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Usurper in King’s Landing would pay well for her brother’s head. “You ought </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">to have gone with him, to keep him safe. You are his sworn sword.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We are in Vaes Dothrak,” he reminded her. “No one may carry a blade here </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">or shed a man’s blood.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Yet men die,” she said. “Jhogo told me. Some of the  traders have eunuchs </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with them, huge men who strangle thieves with wisps of silk. That way no blood is </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="348" height="22" font="2">shed and the gods are not angered.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Then let us hope your brother will be wise enough not to steal anything.” Ser </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Jorah wiped the grease off his mouth with the back of his hand and leaned close </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">over the table. “He had planned to take your dragon’s eggs, until I warned him that </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">I’d cut off his hand if he so much as touched them.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">For a moment Dany was so shocked she had no words. “My eggs. . . but </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">they’re  <i>mine</i>,  Magister Illyrio gave them to me, a bride gift, why would Viserys </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="312" height="22" font="2">want. . . they’re only stones. . .” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="776" height="22" font="2">“The same could be said of rubies and diamonds and fire opals, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Princess. . . and dragon’s eggs are rarer by far. Those traders he’s been drinking </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with would sell their own manhoods for even one of those <i>stones</i>, and with all three </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="558" height="22" font="2">Viserys could buy as many sellswords as he might need.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany had not known, had not even suspected. “Then. . . he should have them. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He does not need to steal them. He had only to ask.  He is my brother. . . and my </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="109" height="22" font="2">true king.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="455" height="22" font="2">“He is your brother,” Ser Jorah acknowledged. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You do not understand, ser,” she said. “My mother died giving me birth, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my father and my brother Rhaegar even before that. I would never have known so </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">much as their names if Viserys had not been there to tell me. He was the only one </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="351" height="22" font="2">left. The only one. He is all I have.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Once,” said Ser Jorah. “No longer,  <i>Khaleesi</i>.  You belong to the Dothraki </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">now. In your womb rides the stallion who mounts the world.” He held out his cup, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">and a slave filled it with fermented mare’s milk, sour-smelling and thick with clots. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany waved her away. Even the smell of it made her feel ill, and she would </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">take no chances of bringing up the horse heart she had forced herself to eat. “What </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">does it mean?” she asked. “What is this stallion? Everyone was shouting it at me, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">but I don’t understand.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The stallion is the <i>khal</i> of <i>khals</i> promised in ancient prophecy, child. He will </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">unite the Dothraki into a single <i>khalasar</i> and ride to the ends of the earth, or so it </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="581" height="22" font="2">was promised. All the people of the world will be his herd.” </text>
</page>
<page number="397" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh,” Dany said in a small voice. Her hand smoothed her robe down over the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">swell of her stomach. “I named him Rhaego.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="473" height="22" font="2">“A name to make the Usurper’s blood run cold.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Suddenly Doreah was tugging at her elbow. “My  <i>lady</i>,  “the handmaid </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">whispered urgently, “your brother. . .” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Dany looked down the length of the long, roofless hall and there he was, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">striding toward her. From the lurch in his step, she could tell at once that Viserys </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="600" height="22" font="2">had found his wine. . . and something that passed for courage. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">He was wearing his scarlet silks, soiled and travel-stained. His cloak and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gloves were black velvet, faded from the sun. His boots were dry and cracked, his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">silver-blond hair matted and tangled. A longsword swung from his belt in a leather </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scabbard. The Dothraki eyed the sword as he passed; Dany heard curses and threats </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and angry muttering rising all around her, like a tide. The music died away in a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="299" height="22" font="2">nervous stammering of drums. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A sense of dread closed around her heart. “Go to him,” she commanded Ser </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jorah. “Stop him. Bring him here. Tell him he can have the dragon’s eggs if that is </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">what he wants.” The knight rose swiftly to his feet. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Where is my sister?” Viserys shouted, his voice thick with wine. “I’ve come </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">for her feast. How dare you presume to eat without me? No one eats before the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">king. Where is she? The whore can’t hide from the dragon.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He stopped beside the largest of the three firepits, peering around at the faces </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the Dothraki. There were five thousand men in the hall, but only a handful who </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knew the Common Tongue. Yet even if his words were incomprehensible, you had </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">only to look at him to know that he was drunk. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah went to him swiftly, whispered something in his ear, and took him </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">by the arm, but Viserys wrenched free. “Keep your hands off me! No one touches </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">the dragon without leave.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Dany glanced anxiously up at the high bench. Khal Drogo was saying </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">something to the other <i>khals</i> beside him. Khal Jommo grinned, and Khal Ogo began </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="172" height="22" font="2">to guffaw loudly. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The sound of laughter made Viserys lift his eyes. “Khal Drogo,” he said </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thickly, his voice almost polite. “I’m here for the feast.” He staggered away from </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="577" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah, making to join the three <i>khals</i> on the high bench. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo rose, spat out a dozen words in Dothraki, faster than Dany could </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">understand, and pointed. “Khal Drogo says your place is not on the high bench,” </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="724" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah translated for her brother. “Khal Drogo says your place is there.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Viserys glanced where the <i>khal</i> was pointing. At the back of the long hall, in a </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">corner by the wall, deep in shadow so better men would not need to look on them, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sat the lowest of the low; raw unblooded boys, old men with clouded eyes and stiff </text>
</page>
<page number="398" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">joints, the dim-witted and the maimed. Far from the meat, and farther from honor. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="490" height="22" font="2">“That is no place for a king,” her brother declared. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Is place,” Khal Drogo answered, in the Common Tongue that Dany had </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">taught him, “for Sorefoot King.” He clapped his hands together. “A cart! Bring cart </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">for <i>Khal Rhaggat!</i>” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Five thousand Dothraki began to laugh and shout. Ser Jorah was standing </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beside Viserys, screaming in his ear, but the roar in the hall was so thunderous that </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Dany could not hear what he was saying. Her brother shouted back and the two men </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">grappled, until Mormont knocked Viserys bodily to the floor. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="276" height="22" font="2">Her brother drew his sword. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The bared steel shone a fearful red in the glare from the firepits. “<i>Keep away </i></text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>from me!</i>” Viserys hissed. Ser Jorah backed off a step, and her brother climbed </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">unsteadily to his feet. He waved the sword over his head, the borrowed blade that </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio had given him to make him seem more kingly. Dothraki were </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="523" height="22" font="2">shrieking at him from all sides, screaming vile curses. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Dany gave a wordless cry of terror. She knew what a drawn sword meant </text>

<text top="528" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Her voice made Viserys turn his head, and he saw her for the first time. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“There she is,” he said, smiling. He stalked toward her, slashing at the air as if to </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="701" height="22" font="2">cut a path through a wall of enemies, though no one tried to bar his way. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“The blade. . . you must not,” she begged him. “Please, Viserys. It is </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">forbidden. Put down the sword and come share my cushions. There’s drink, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">food. . . is it the dragon’s eggs you want? You can have them, only throw away the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">sword.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="738" height="22" font="2">“Do as she tells you, fool,” Ser Jorah shouted, “before you get us all killed.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Viserys laughed. “They can’t kill us. They can’t shed blood here in the sacred </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">city. . . but  <i>I</i>  can.” He laid the point of his sword between Daenerys’s breasts and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slid it downward, over the curve of her belly. “I want what I came for,” he told her. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“I want the crown he promised me. He bought you, but he never paid for you. Tell </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">him I want what I bargained for, or I’m taking you back. You and the eggs both. He </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">can keep his bloody foal. I’ll cut the bastard out and leave it for him.” The sword </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">point pushed through her silks and pricked at her navel. Viserys was weeping, she </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw; weeping and laughing, both at the same time, this man who had once been her </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">brother. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Distantly, as from far away, Dany heard her handmaid Jhiqui sobbing in fear, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pleading that she dared not translate, that the  <i>khal</i>  would bind her and drag her </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">behind his horse all the way up the Mother of Mountains. She put her arm around </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="522" height="22" font="2">the girl. “Don’t be afraid,” she said. “I shall tell him.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She did not know if she had enough words, yet when she was done Khal </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Drogo spoke a few brusque sentences in Dothraki, and she knew he understood. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The sun of her life stepped down from the high bench. “What did he say?” the man </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">who had been her brother asked her, flinching. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It had grown so silent in the hall that she could hear the bells in Khal Drogo’s </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hair, chiming softly with each step he took. His bloodriders followed him, like three </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">copper shadows. Daenerys had gone cold all over. “He says you shall have a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">splendid golden crown that men shall tremble to behold.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Viserys smiled and lowered his sword. That was the saddest thing, the thing </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that tore at her afterward. . . the way he smiled. “That was all I wanted,” he said. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="224" height="22" font="2">“What was promised.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">When the sun of her life reached her, Dany slid an arm around his waist. The </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>khal</i> said a word, and his bloodriders leapt forward. Qotho seized the man who had </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been her brother by the arms. Haggo shattered his wrist with a single, sharp twist of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his huge hands. Cohollo pulled the sword from his limp fingers. Even now Viserys </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">did not understand. “No,” he shouted, “you cannot touch me, I am the dragon, the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="315" height="22" font="4"><i>dragon</i>, and I will be <i>crowned!</i>” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo unfastened his belt. The medallions were pure gold, massive and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ornate, each one as large as a man’s hand. He shouted a command. Cook slaves </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pulled a heavy iron stew pot from the firepit, dumped the stew onto the ground, and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">returned the pot to the flames. Drogo tossed in the belt and watched without </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">expression as the medallions turned red and began to lose their shape. She could see </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fires dancing in the onyx of his eyes. A slave handed him a pair of thick horsehair </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="671" height="22" font="2">mittens, and he pulled them on, never so much as looking at the man. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Viserys began to scream the high, wordless scream of the coward facing </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">death. He kicked and twisted, whimpered like a dog and wept like a child, but the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dothraki held him tight between them. Ser Jorah had made his way to Dany’s side. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="668" height="22" font="2">He put a hand on her shoulder. “Turn away, my princess, I beg you.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="668" height="22" font="2">“No.” She folded her arms across the swell of her belly, protectively. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">At the last, Viserys looked at her. “Sister, please. . . Dany, tell them. . . make </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="242" height="22" font="2">them. . . sweet sister. . .” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When the gold was half-melted and starting to run, Drogo reached into the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">flames, snatched out the pot. “Crown!” he roared. “Here. A crown for Cart King!” </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">And upended the pot over the head of the man who had been her brother. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">face was like nothing human. His feet hammered a frantic beat against the dirt floor, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slowed, stopped. Thick globs of molten gold dripped down onto his chest, setting </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="635" height="22" font="2">the scarlet silk to smoldering. . . yet no drop of blood was spilled. </text>

<text top="345" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">snarled. Last of all, he came to the tomb where his father slept, with Brandon and </text>

<text top="456" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">The room was black as pitch, and someone was hammering on the door. “Lord </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="303" height="22" font="2">Eddard,” a voice called loudly. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A moment.” Groggy and naked, he stumbled his way across the darkened </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">chamber. When he opened the door, he found Tomard with an upraised fist, and </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">Cayn with a taper in hand. Between them stood the king’s own steward. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The man’s face might have been carved of stone, so little did it show. “My </text>

<text top="649" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">So  Robert had returned from his hunt. It was long past time. “I shall need a </text>

<text top="704" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">clothes; white linen tunic and grey cloak, trousers cut open down his plaster-</text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sheathed leg, his badge of office, and last of all a belt of heavy silver links. He </text>

<text top="787" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Red Keep was dark and still as Cayn and Tomard escorted him across the </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">inner bailey. The moon hung low over the walls, ripening toward full. On the </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="558" height="22" font="2">ramparts, a guardsman in a gold cloak walked his rounds. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The royal apartments were in Maegor’s Holdfast, a massive square fortress </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that nestled in the heart of the Red Keep behind walls twelve feet thick and a dry </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moat lined with iron spikes, a castle-within-a-castle. Ser Boros Blount guarded the </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">far end of the bridge, white steel armor ghostly in the moonlight. Within, Ned </text>

<text top="1063" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chill went through him. Ser Barristan’s face was as pale as his armor. Ned had only </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to look at him to know that something was dreadfully wrong. The royal  steward </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="549" height="22" font="2">“Bring him here,” Robert’s voice called, strangely thick. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Fires blazed in the twin hearths at either end of the bedchamber, filling the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">room with a sullen red glare. The heat within was suffocating. Robert lay across the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">canopied bed. At the bedside hovered Grand Maester Pycelle, while Lord Renly </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">paced restlessly before the shuttered windows. Servants moved back and forth, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">feeding logs to the fire and boiling wine. Cersei Lannister sat on the edge of the bed </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beside her husband. Her hair was tousled, as if from sleep, but there was nothing </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sleepy in her eyes. They followed Ned as Tomard and Cayn helped him cross the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="656" height="22" font="2">room. He seemed to move very slowly, as if he were still dreaming. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The king still wore his boots. Ned could see dried mud and blades of grass </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">clinging to the leather where Robert’s feet stuck out beneath the blanket that </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">covered him, A green doublet lay on the floor, slashed open and discarded, the cloth </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">crusted with red-brown stains. The room smelled of smoke and blood and death. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Ned,” the king whispered when he saw him. His face was pale as milk. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="184" height="22" font="2">“Come. . . closer.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His men brought him close. Ned steadied himself with a hand on the bedpost. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He had only to look down at Robert to know how bad it was. “What. . .?” he began, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">his throat clenched. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A boar.” Lord Renly was still in his hunting greens, his cloak spattered with </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">blood. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A devil,” the king husked. “My own fault. Too much wine, damn me to hell. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">Missed my thrust.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“And where were the rest of you?” Ned demanded of Lord Renly. “Where </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">was Ser Barristan and the Kingsguard?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Renly’s mouth twitched. “My brother commanded us to stand aside and let </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="248" height="22" font="2">him take the boar alone.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="307" height="22" font="2">Eddard Stark lifted the blanket. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">They had done what  they could to close him up, but it was nowhere near </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">enough. The boar must have been a fearsome thing. It had ripped the king from </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">groin to nipple with its tusks. The wine-soaked bandages that Grand Maester </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Pycelle had applied were already black with blood, and the smell off the wound was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">hideous. Ned’s stomach turned. He let the blanket fall. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Stinks,” Robert said. “The stink of death, don’t think I can’t smell it. Bastard </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">did me good, eh? But I. . . I paid him back in kind, Ned.” The king’s smile was as </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">terrible as his wound, his teeth red. “Drove a knife right through his eye. Ask them </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">if I didn’t. Ask them.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Truly,” Lord Renly murmured. “We brought the carcass back with us, at my </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="210" height="22" font="2">brother’s command.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“For the feast,” Robert whispered. “Now leave us. The lot of you. I need to </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="407" height="22" font="2">“Robert, my sweet lord. . .” Cersei began. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I said <i>leave</i>,” Robert insisted with a hint of his old fierceness. “What part of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="356" height="22" font="2">that don’t you understand, woman?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Cersei gathered up her skirts and her dignity and led the way to the door. Lord </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Renly and the others followed. Grand Maester Pycelle lingered, his hands shaking </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as he offered the king a cup of thick white liquid. “The milk of the poppy, Your </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">Grace,” he said. “Drink. For your pain.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robert knocked the cup away with the back of his hand. “Away with you. I’ll </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">sleep soon enough, old fool. Get out.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="760" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle gave Ned a stricken look as he shuffled from the room. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Damn you, Robert,” Ned said when they were alone. His leg was throbbing </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">so badly he was almost blind with pain. Or perhaps it was grief that fogged his eyes. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He lowered himself to the bed, beside his friend. “Why do you always have to be so </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">headstrong?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Ah, fuck you, Ned,” the king said hoarsely. “I killed the bastard, didn’t I?” A </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lock of matted black hair fell across his eyes as he glared up at Ned. “Ought to do </text>

<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">turned into a grunt as a spasm  of pain hit him. “Gods have mercy,” he muttered, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">swallowing his agony. “The girl. Daenerys. Only a child, you were right. . . that’s </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">why, the girl. . . the gods sent the boar. . . sent to punish me. . .” The king coughed, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bringing up blood. “Wrong, it was wrong, I. . . only a girl. . . Varys, Littlefinger, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">even my brother. . . worthless. . . no one to tell me no but you, Ned. . . only you. . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">He lifted his hand, the gesture pained and feeble. “Paper and ink. There, on the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">table. Write what I tell you.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned smoothed the paper out across his knee and took up the quill. “At your </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="242" height="22" font="2">command, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“This is the will and word of Robert of House Baratheon, the First of his </text>

<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him more. So Ned bent his head and wrote, but where the king had said “my son </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Joffrey,” he scrawled “my heir” instead. The deceit made him feel soiled. <i>The lies </i></text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Robert,” Ned said in a voice thick with grief, “you must not do this. Don’t </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="330" height="22" font="2">die on me. The realm needs you.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robert took his hand, fingers squeezing hard. “You are. . . such a bad liar, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark,” he said through his pain. “The realm. . . the  realm knows. . . what a </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ned told his dying friend, “not so bad as Aerys, Your Grace. Not near </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="174" height="22" font="2">so bad as Aerys.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Robert managed a weak red smile. “At the least, they will say. . . this last </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thing. . . this I did right. You won’t fail me. You’ll rule now. You’ll hate it, worse </text>

<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Yes, Your Grace.” Ned offered Robert the paper. The king scrawled his </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">signature blindly, leaving a smear of  blood across the letter. “The seal should be </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">witnessed.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Serve the boar at my funeral feast,” Robert rasped. “Apple in its mouth, skin </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="782" height="22" font="2">seared crisp. Eat the bastard. Don’t care if you choke on him. Promise me, Ned.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="534" height="22" font="2">“I promise.” <i>Promise me, Ned</i>, Lyanna’s voice echoed. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The girl,” the king said. “Daenerys. Let her live. If you can, if it. . . not too </text>

<text top="639" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">son, Ned. Make him be. . . better than me.” He winced. “Gods have mercy.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="455" height="22" font="2">“They will, my friend,” Ned said. “They will.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The king closed his eyes and seemed to relax. “Killed by a pig,” he muttered. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="389" height="22" font="2">“Ought to laugh, but it hurts too much.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">Ned was not laughing. “Shall I call them back?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="698" height="22" font="2">Robert gave a weak nod. “As you will. Gods, why is it so <i>cold</i> in here?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The servants rushed back in and hurried to feed the fires. The queen had gone; </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that was some small relief, at least. If she had any sense, Cersei would take her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">children and fly before the break of day, Ned thought. She had lingered too long </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">already. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">King Robert did not seem to miss her. He bid his brother Renly and Grand </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Maester Pycelle to stand in witness as he pressed his seal into the hot yellow wax </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that Ned had dripped upon his letter. “Now give me something for the pain and let </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">me die.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Hurriedly Grand Maester Pycelle mixed him another draught of the milk of </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the poppy. This time the king drank deeply. His black beard was beaded with thick </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="654" height="22" font="2">white droplets when he threw the empty cup aside. “Will I dream?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="460" height="22" font="2">Ned gave him his answer. “You will, my lord.” </text>
</page>
<page number="404" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Good,” he said, smiling. “I will give Lyanna your love, Ned. Take care of my </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="171" height="22" font="2">children for me.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The words twisted in Ned’s belly like a knife. For a moment he was at a loss. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He could not bring himself to lie. Then he remembered the bastards: little Barra at </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">her mother’s breast, Mya in the Vale, Gendry at his forge, and all the others. “I </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">shall. . . guard your children as if they were my own,” he said slowly. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert nodded and closed his eyes. Ned watched his old friend sag softly into </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="2">the pillows as the milk of the poppy washed the pain from his face. Sleep took him. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Heavy chains jangled softly as Grand Maester Pycelle came up to Ned. “I will </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">do all in my power, my lord, but the wound has mortified. It took them two days to </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">get him  back. By the time I saw him, it was too late. I can lessen His Grace’s </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">suffering, but only the gods can heal him now.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="246" height="22" font="2">“How long?” Ned asked. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“By rights, he should be dead already. I have never seen a man cling to life so </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="96" height="22" font="2">fiercely.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“My brother was always  strong,” Lord Renly said. “Not wise, perhaps, but </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">strong.” In the sweltering heat of the bedchamber, his brow was slick with sweat. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">He might have been Robert’s ghost as he stood there, young and dark and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">handsome. “He slew the boar. His entrails were sliding from his belly, yet somehow </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">he slew the boar.” His voice was full of wonder. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Robert was never a man to leave the battleground so long as a foe remained </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">standing,” Ned told him. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Outside the door, Ser Barristan Selmy still guarded the tower stairs. “Maester </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Pycelle has given Robert the milk of the poppy,” Ned told him. “See that no one </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">disturbs his rest without leave from me.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It shall be as you command, my lord.” Ser Barristan seemed old beyond his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">years. “I have failed my sacred trust.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Even the truest knight cannot protect a king against himself,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Robert loved to hunt boar. I have seen him take a thousand of them.” He would </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stand his ground without flinching, his legs braced, the great spear in his hands, and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as often as not he would curse the boar as it charged, and wait until the last possible </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">second, until it was almost on him, before he killed it with a single sure and savage </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">thrust. “No one could know this one would be his death.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="383" height="22" font="2">“You are kind to say so, Lord Eddard.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">“The king himself said as much. He blamed the wine.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The white-haired knight gave a weary nod. “His Grace was reeling in his </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">saddle by the time we flushed the boar from his lair, yet he commanded us all to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">stand aside.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I wonder, Ser Barristan,” asked Varys, so quietly, “who gave the king this </text>
</page>
<page number="405" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="74" height="22" font="2">wine?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned had not heard the eunuch approach, but when he looked around, there he </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stood. He wore a black velvet robe that brushed the floor, and his face was freshly </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">powdered. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="597" height="22" font="2">“The wine was from the king’s own skin,” Ser Barristan said. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="458" height="22" font="2">“Only one skin? Hunting is such thirsty work.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I did not keep count. More than one, for a certainty. His squire would fetch </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="410" height="22" font="2">him a fresh skin whenever he required it.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Such a dutiful boy,” said Varys, “to make certain His Grace did not lack for </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">refreshment.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned had a bitter taste in his mouth. He recalled the two fair-haired boys </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Robert had sent chasing after a breastplate stretcher. The king had told everyone the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">tale that night at the feast, laughing until he shook. “Which squire?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="406" height="22" font="2">“The elder,” said Ser Barristan. “Lancel.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I know the lad well,” said Varys. “A stalwart boy, Ser Kevan Lannister’s </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">son, nephew to Lord Tywin and cousin to the queen. I hope the dear sweet lad does </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not blame himself. Children are so vulnerable in the innocence of their youth, how </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">well do I remember.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Certainly Varys had once been young. Ned doubted that he had ever been </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">innocent. “You mention children. Robert had a change of heart concerning </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="801" height="22" font="2">Daenerys Targaryen. Whatever arrangements you made, I want unmade. At once.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Alas,” said Varys. “At once may be too late. I fear those birds have flown. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">But I shall do what I can, my lord. With your leave.” He bowed and vanished down </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">the steps, his soft-soled slippers whispering against the stone as he made his </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">descent. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Cayn and Tomard were helping Ned across the bridge when Lord Renly </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">emerged from Maegor’s Holdfast. “Lord Eddard,” he called after Ned, “a moment, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">if you would be so kind.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="286" height="22" font="2">Ned stopped. “As you wish.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Renly walked to his side. “Send your men away.” They met in the center of </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the bridge, the dry moat beneath them. Moonlight silvered the cruel edges of the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">spikes that lined its bed. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">Ned gestured. Tomard and Cayn bowed their heads and backed away </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">respectfully. Lord Renly glanced warily at Ser Boros on the far end of the span, at </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Ser Preston in the doorway behind them. “That letter.” He leaned close. “Was it the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">regency? Has my brother named you Protector?” He did not wait for a reply. “My </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">lord, I have thirty men in my personal guard, and other friends beside, knights and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="682" height="22" font="2">lords. Give me an hour, and I can put a hundred swords in your hand.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="557" height="22" font="2">“And what should I do with a hundred swords, my lord?” </text>
</page>
<page number="406" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Strike! </i>Now, while the castle sleeps.” Renly looked back at Ser Boros again </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and dropped his voice to an urgent whisper. “We must get Joffrey away from his </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mother and take him in hand. Protector or no, the man who holds the king holds the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">kingdom. We should seize Myrcella and Tommen as well. Once we have her </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">children, Cersei will not dare oppose us. The council will confirm you as Lord </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">Protector and make Joffrey your ward.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned regarded him coldly. “Robert is not dead yet. The gods may spare him. If </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">not, I shall convene the council to hear his final words and consider the matter of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the succession, but I will not dishonor his last hours on earth by shedding blood in </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Renly took a step back, taut as a bowstring. “Every moment you delay </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">gives Cersei another moment to prepare. By the time Robert dies, it may be too </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="223" height="22" font="2">late. . . for both of us.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">“Then we should pray that Robert does not die.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="344" height="22" font="2">“Small chance of that,” said Renly. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="349" height="22" font="2">“Sometimes the gods are merciful.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Lannisters are not.” Lord Renly turned away and went back across the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">moat, to the tower where his brother lay dying. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">By the time Ned returned to his chambers, he felt weary and heartsick, yet </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there was no question of his going back to sleep, not now. <i>When you play the game </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>of thrones, you win or you die</i>, Cersei Lannister had told him in the godswood. He </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">found himself wondering if he had done the right thing by refusing Lord Renly’s </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">offer. He had no taste for these intrigues, and there was no honor in threatening </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">children, and yet. . . if Cersei elected to fight rather than flee, he might well have </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="501" height="22" font="2">need of Renly’s hundred swords, and more besides. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I want Littlefinger,” he told Cayn. “If he’s not in his chambers, take as many </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">men as you need and search every winesink and whorehouse in King’s Landing </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">until you find him. Bring him to me before break of day.” Cayn bowed and took his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leave, and Ned turned to Tomard. “The <i>Wind Witch</i> sails on the evening tide. Have </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="375" height="22" font="2">“Ten men, with Porther in command.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Twenty, and you will command,” Ned said. Porther was a brave man, but </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">headstrong. He wanted someone more solid and sensible to keep watch over his </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">daughters. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“As you wish, m’lord,” Tom said. “Can’t say I’ll be sad to see the back of this </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You will pass near Dragonstone when you turn north. I need you to deliver a </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="280" height="22" font="2">“As you command, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When Tomard had left him, Lord Eddard Stark sat staring at the flame of the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">candle that burned beside him on the table. For a moment his grief overwhelmed </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him. He wanted nothing so much as to seek out the godswood, to kneel before the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">heart tree and pray for the life of Robert Baratheon, who had been more than a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brother to him. Men would whisper afterward that Eddard Stark had betrayed his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">king’s friendship and disinherited his sons; he could only hope that the gods would </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">know better, and that Robert would learn the truth of it in the land beyond the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">grave. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned took out the king’s last letter. A roll of crisp white parchment sealed with </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">golden wax, a few short words and a smear of blood. How small the difference </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="500" height="22" font="2">between victory and defeat, between life and death. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He drew out a fresh sheet of paper and dipped his quill in the inkpot. <i>To His </i></text>

<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The letters seemed to writhe and twist on the paper as his hand trailed to a </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stop. Lord Tywin and Ser Jaime were not men to suffer disgrace meekly; they </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would fight rather than flee. No doubt Lord Stannis was wary, after the murder of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jon Arryn, but it was imperative that he sail for King’s Landing at once with all his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="412" height="22" font="2">power, before the Lannisters could march. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned chose each word with care. When he was done, he signed the letter </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His regency would be a short one, he reflected as the wax softened. The new </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">king would choose his own Hand. Ned would be free to go home. The thought of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell brought a wan smile to his face. He wanted to hear Bran’s laughter once </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">more, to go hawking with Robb, to watch Rickon at play. He wanted to drift off to a </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="560" height="22" font="2">Ned scowled. “The king lies wounded and near to death.” </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Ned’s eyes flicked to the king’s letter on the table beside him, its seal </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="501" height="22" font="2">unbroken. “And how is it you know that, my lord?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="734" height="22" font="2">“Varys hinted as much,” Littlefinger said, “and you have just confirmed it.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ned’s mouth twisted in anger. “Damn Varys and his little birds. Catelyn spoke </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="519" height="22" font="2">truly, the man has some black art. I do not trust him.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Excellent. You’re learning.” Littlefinger leaned forward. “Yet I’ll wager you </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">did not drag me here in the black of night to discuss the eunuch.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ned admitted. “I know the  secret Jon Arryn was murdered to protect. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Robert will leave no trueborn son behind him. Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">Lannister’s bastards, born of his incestuous union with the queen.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger lifted an eyebrow. “Shocking,” he said in a tone that suggested he </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="762" height="22" font="2">was not shocked at all. “The girl as well? No doubt. So when the king dies. . .” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“The throne by rights passes to Lord Stannis, the elder of Robert’s two </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Lord Petyr stroked his pointed beard as he considered the matter. “So it would </text>

<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“<i>Unless</i>, my lord? There is no <i>seeming</i> to this. Stannis is the heir. Nothing can </text>

<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Stannis cannot take the throne without your help. If you’re wise, you’ll make </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">certain Joffrey succeeds.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="579" height="22" font="2">Ned gave him a stony stare. “Have you no shred of honor?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, a <i>shred</i>, surely,” Littlefinger replied negligently. “Hear me out. Stannis </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">is no friend of yours, nor of mine. Even his brothers can scarcely stomach him. The </text>

<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">you for it. And his ascent will mean war. Stannis cannot rest easy on the throne </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">until Cersei and her bastards are dead. Do you think Lord Tywin will sit idly while </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his daughter’s head is measured for a spike? Casterly Rock will rise, and not alone. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert found it in him to pardon men who served King Aerys, so long as they did </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him fealty. Stannis is less forgiving. He will not have forgotten the siege of Storm’s </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">and put Lord Renly on the throne.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="209" height="22" font="2">“<i>We?</i>” Ned repeated. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger gave a shrug. “You’ll need someone to share your burdens. I </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">assure you, my price would be modest.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Your price.” Ned’s voice was ice. “Lord Baelish, what you suggest is </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">treason.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="181" height="22" font="2">“Only if we lose.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You forget,” Ned told him. “You forget Jon Arryn. You forget Jory Cassel. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">And you forget this.” He drew the dagger and laid it on the table between them; a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">length of dragonbone and Valyrian steel, as sharp as the difference between right </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and wrong, between true and false, between life and death. “They sent a man to <i>cut </i></text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger sighed. “I fear I did forget,  my lord. Pray forgive me. For a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">moment I did not remember that I was talking to a Stark.” His mouth quirked. “So it </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">will be Stannis, and war?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="375" height="22" font="2">“It is not a choice. Stannis is the heir.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Far be it from me to dispute the Lord Protector. What would you have of me, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">then? Not my wisdom, for a certainty.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I shall do my best to forget your. . . wisdom,” Ned said with distaste. “I </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">called you here to ask for the help you promised Catelyn. This is a perilous hour for </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all of us. Robert has named me Protector, true enough, but in the eyes of the world, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">Joffrey is still his son and heir. The queen has a dozen knights and a hundred men-</text>

<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“And you without an army.” Littlefinger toyed with the dagger on the table, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">turning it slowly with a finger. “There is small love lost between Lord Renly and </text>

<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spinning in place. Round and round it went, wobbling as it turned. When at last it </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slowed to a stop, the blade pointed at Littlefinger. “Why, there’s your answer,” he </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said, smiling. “They follow the man who pays them.” He leaned back and looked </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Ned full in the face, his grey-green eyes bright with mockery. “You wear your </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">honor like a suit of armor, Stark. You think it keeps you safe, but all it does is </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">weigh you down and make it hard for you to move. Look at you now. You know </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">why you summoned me here. You know what you want to ask me to do. You know </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="746" height="22" font="2">it has to be done. . . but it’s not <i>honorable</i>, so the words stick in your throat.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned’s neck was rigid with tension. For a moment he was so angry that he did </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">not trust himself to speak. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger laughed. “I ought to make you say it, but that would be cruel. . . so </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have no fear, my good lord. For the sake of the love I bear for Catelyn, I will go to </text>

<text top="290" left="97" width="776" height="22" font="2">plopped himself down on the bench. “I’ve been summoned to the sept,” Sam </text>
<text top="318" left="97" width="774" height="22" font="2">said in an excited whisper. “They’re passing me out of training. I’m to be made </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">a brother with the rest of you. Can you believe it?” </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="125" height="22" font="2">“No, truly?” </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Truly. I’m to assist Maester Aemon with the library and the birds. He needs </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">someone who can read and write letters.” </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="413" height="22" font="2">“You’ll do well at that,” Jon said, smiling. </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sam glanced about anxiously. “Is it time to go? I shouldn’t be late, they might </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">change their minds.” He was fairly bouncing as they crossed the weed-strewn </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">courtyard. The day was warm and sunny. Rivulets of water trickled down the sides </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="498" height="22" font="2">of the Wall, so the ice seemed to sparkle and shine. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Inside the sept, the great crystal caught the morning light as it streamed </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">through the south-facing window and spread it in a rainbow on the altar. Pyp’s </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mouth dropped open when he caught sight of Sam, and Toad poked Grenn in the </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ribs, but no one dared say a word. Septon Celladar was swinging a censer, filling </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">the air with fragrant incense that reminded Jon of Lady Stark’s little sept in </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">Winterfell. For once the septon seemed sober. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The high officers arrived in a body; Maester Aemon leaning on Clydas, Ser </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Alliser cold-eyed and grim, Lord Commander Mormont resplendent in a black wool </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">doublet with silvered bearclaw fastenings. Behind them came the senior members </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the three orders: red-faced Bowen Marsh the Lord Steward, First Builder Othell </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Yarwyck, and Ser Jaremy Rykker, who commanded the rangers in the absence of </text>

<text top="925" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mormont stood before the altar, the rainbow shining on his broad bald head. </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“You came to us outlaws,” he began, “poachers, rapers, debtors, killers, and thieves. </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">You came to us children. You came to us alone, in chains, with neither friends nor </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">your former loyalties, put aside your grudges, forget old wrongs and old loves alike. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">Here you begin anew. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A man of the Night’s Watch lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, nor a </text>

<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">desertion is death.” The Old Bear paused for a moment before he said, “Are there </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">any among you who wish to leave our company? If so, go now, and no one shall </text>

<text top="446" left="108" width="153" height="22" font="2">No one moved. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Well and good,” said Mormont. “You may take your vows here at evenfall, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">before Septon Celladar and  the first of your order. Do any of you keep to the old </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">gods?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="262" height="22" font="2">Jon stood. “I do, my lord.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I expect you will want to say your words before a heart tree, as your uncle </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">did,” Mormont said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord,” Jon said. The gods of the sept had nothing to do with him; the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="545" height="22" font="2">blood of the First Men flowed in the veins of the Starks. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He heard Grenn whispering behind him. “There’s no godswood here. Is there? </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">I never saw a godswood.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You wouldn’t see a herd of aurochs until they trampled you into the snow,” </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">Pyp whispered back. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="583" height="22" font="2">“I would so,” Grenn insisted. “I’d see them a long way off.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mormont himself confirmed Grenn’s doubts. “Castle Black has no need of a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">godswood. Beyond the Wall the haunted forest stands as it stood in the Dawn Age, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">long before the Andals brought the Seven across the narrow sea. You will find a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="786" height="22" font="2">grove of weirwoods half a league from this spot, and mayhap your gods as well.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My lord.” The voice made Jon glance back in surprise. Samwell Tarly was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">on his feet. The fat boy wiped his sweaty palms against his tunic. “Might I. . . might </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">I go as well? To say my words at this heart tree?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="587" height="22" font="2">“Does House Tarly keep the old gods too?” Mormont asked. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“No, my lord,” Sam replied in a thin, nervous voice. The high officers </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">frightened him, Jon knew, the Old Bear most of all. “I was named in the light of the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Seven at the sept on Horn Hill, as my father was, and his father, and all the Tarlys </text>

<page number="413" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">for a thousand years.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Why would you forsake the gods of your father and your House?” wondered </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="196" height="22" font="2">Ser Jaremy Rykker. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The Night’s Watch is my House now,” Sam said. “The Seven have never </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">answered my prayers. Perhaps the old gods will.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“As you wish, boy,” Mormont said. Sam took his seat again, as did Jon. “We </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have placed each of you in an order, as befits our need and your own strengths and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">skills.” Bowen Marsh stepped forward and handed him a paper. The Lord </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Commander unrolled it and began to read. “Haider, to the builders,” he began. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Haider gave a stiff nod of approval. “Grenn, to the rangers. Albett, to the builders. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Pypar, to the rangers.” Pyp looked over at Jon and wiggled his ears. “Samwell, to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the stewards.” Sam sagged with relief,  mopping at his brow with a  scrap of silk. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Matthar, to the rangers. Dareon, to the stewards. Todder, to the rangers. Jon, to the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">stewards.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">The  <i>stewards?</i>  For a moment Jon could not believe what he had heard. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Mormont must have read it wrong. He started to rise, to open his mouth, to tell them </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">there had been a mistake. . . and then he saw Ser Alliser studying him, eyes shiny as </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="358" height="22" font="2">two flakes of obsidian, and he knew. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear rolled up the paper. “Your firsts will instruct you in your duties. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">May all the gods preserve you, brothers.” The Lord Commander favored them with </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a half bow, and took his leave. Ser Alliser went with him, a thin smile on his face. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">Jon had never seen the master-at-arms took quite so happy. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Rangers with me,” Ser Jaremy Rykker called when they were gone. Pyp was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">staring at Jon as he got slowly to his feet. His ears were red. Grenn, grinning </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">broadly, did not seem to realize that anything was amiss. Matt and Toad fell in </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="558" height="22" font="2">beside them, and they followed Ser Jaremy from the sept. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Builders,” announced lantern-jawed Othell Yarwyck. Haider and Albett </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">trailed out after him. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon looked around him in sick disbelief. Maester Aemon’s blind eyes were </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">raised toward the light he could not see. The septon was arranging crystals on the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">altar. Only Sam and Darcon remained on the benches; a fat boy, a singer. . . and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lord Steward Bowen Marsh rubbed his plump hands together. “Samwell, you </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">will assist Maester Aemon in the rookery and library. Chett is going to the kennels, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to help with the hounds. You shall have his cell, so as to be close to the maester </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">night and day. I trust you will take good care of him. He is very old and very </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">precious to us. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Dareon, I am told that you sang at many a high lord’s table and shared their </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Marsh turned his smile on Jon. “Lord Commander Mormont has requested </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">you for his personal steward, Jon. You’ll sleep in a cell beneath his chambers, in the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="272" height="22" font="2">Lord Commander’s tower.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“And what will my duties be?” Jon asked sharply. “Will I serve the Lord </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">Commander’s meals, help him fasten his clothes, fetch hot water for his bath?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Certainly.” Marsh frowned at Jon’s tone. “And you will run his messages, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">keep a fire burning in his chambers, change his sheets and blankets daily, and do all </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="519" height="22" font="2">else that the Lord Commander might require of you.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="316" height="22" font="2">“Do you take me for a servant?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No,” Maester Aemon said, from the back of the sept. Clydas helped him </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stand. “We took you for a man of the Night’s Watch. . . but perhaps we were wrong </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">in that.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was all Jon could do to stop himself from walking out. Was he supposed to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">churn butter and sew doublets like a girl for the rest of his days? “May I go?” he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">asked stiffly. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">“As you wish,” Bowen Marsh responded. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dareon and Sam left with him. They descended to the yard in silence. Outside, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jon looked up at the Wall shining in the sun, the melting ice creeping down its side </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in a hundred thin fingers. Jon’s rage was such that he would have smashed it all in </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">an instant, and the world be damned. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Jon,” Samwell Tarly said excitedly. “Wait. Don’t you see what they’re </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="82" height="22" font="2">doing?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon turned on him in a fury. “I see Ser Alliser’s bloody hand, that’s all I see. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="367" height="22" font="2">He wanted to shame me, and he has.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dareon gave him a look. “The stewards are fine for the likes of you and me, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="292" height="22" font="2">Sam, but not for Lord Snow.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I’m a better swordsman and a better rider than any of you,” Jon blazed back. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">“It’s not <i>fair</i>!” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Fair?” Dareon sneered. “The girl was waiting for me, naked as the day she </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was born. She pulled me through the window, and you talk to me of  <i>fair</i>?” He </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">walked off. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="489" height="22" font="2">“There is no shame in being a steward,” Sam said. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life washing an old man’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">smallclothes?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The old man is Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch,” Sam reminded him. </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Dickon was there. He wanted his  <i>heir</i>  at his side, don’t you see? To watch and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">listen and learn from all he did. I’ll wager that’s why Lord Mormont requested you, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">Jon. What else could it be? He wants to groom you for <i>command</i>!” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon was taken aback. It was true, Lord Eddard had often made Robb part of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his councils back at Winterfell. Could Sam be right? Even a bastard could rise high </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="735" height="22" font="2">in the Night’s Watch, they said. “I never asked for this,” he said stubbornly. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="519" height="22" font="2">“None of us are here for <i>asking</i>,” Sam reminded him. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="379" height="22" font="2">And suddenly Jon Snow was ashamed. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Craven or not, Samwell Tarly had found the courage to accept his fate like a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man.  <i>On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns</i>,  Benjen Stark had said the last </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">night Jon had seen him alive.  <i>You’re no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the </i></text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>smell of summer still on you</i>.  He’d heard it said that bastards grow up faster than </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="518" height="22" font="2">other children; on the Wall, you grew up or you died. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="689" height="22" font="2">Jon let out a deep sigh. “You have the right of it. I was acting the boy.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="473" height="22" font="2">“Then you’ll stay and say your words with me?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="591" height="22" font="2">“The old gods will be expecting us.” He made himself smile. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They set out late that afternoon. The Wall had no gates as such, neither here at </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Castle Black nor anywhere along its three hundred miles. They led their horses </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down a narrow tunnel cut through the ice, cold dark walls pressing in around them </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as the passage twisted and turned. Three times their way was blocked by iron bars, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and they had to stop while Bowen Marsh drew out his keys and unlocked the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">massive chains that secured them. Jon could sense the vast weight pressing down on </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him as he waited behind the Lord Steward. The air was colder than a tomb, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">more still. He felt a strange relief when they reemerged into the afternoon light on </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="257" height="22" font="2">the north side of the Wall. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Sam blinked at the sudden glare and looked around apprehensively. “The </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wildlings. . . they wouldn’t. . . they’d never dare come this close to the Wall. Would </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">they?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“They never have.” Jon climbed into his saddle. When Bowen Marsh and their </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ranger escort had mounted, Jon put two fingers in his mouth and whistled. Ghost </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="294" height="22" font="2">came loping out of the tunnel. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The Lord Steward’s garron whickered  and backed away from the direwolf. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">“Do you mean to take that beast?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord,” Jon said. Ghost’s head lifted. He seemed to taste the air. In </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the blink of an eye he was off, racing across the broad, weed-choked field to vanish </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Once they had entered the forest, they were in a different world. Jon had often </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">hunted with his father and Jory and his brother Robb. He knew the wolfswood </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">around Winterfell as well as any man. The haunted forest was much the same, and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="345" height="22" font="2">yet the feel of it was very different. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Perhaps it was all in the knowing. They had ridden past the end of the world; </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">somehow that changed everything. Every shadow seemed darker, every sound more </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ominous. The trees pressed close and shut out the light of the setting sun. A thin </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">crust of snow cracked beneath the hooves of their horses, with a sound like breaking </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bones. When the wind set the leaves to rustling, it was like a chilly finger tracing a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">path up Jon’s spine. The Wall was at their backs, and only the gods knew what lay </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">ahead. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The sun was sinking below the trees when they reached their destination, a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">small clearing in the deep of the wood where nine weirwoods grew in a rough </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">circle. Jon drew in a breath, and he saw Sam Tarly staring. Even in the wolfswood, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">you never found more than two or three of the white trees growing together; a grove </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of nine was unheard of. The forest floor was carpeted with fallen leaves, bloodred </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on top, black rot beneath. The wide smooth trunks were bone pale, and nine faces </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stared inward. The dried sap that crusted in the eyes was red and hard as ruby. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Bowen Marsh commanded them to leave their horses outside the circle. “This is a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="341" height="22" font="2">sacred place, we will not defile it.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When they entered the grove, Samwell Tarly turned slowly looking at each </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">face in turn. No two were quite alike. “They’re watching us,” he whispered. “The </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">old gods.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="430" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” Jon knelt, and Sam knelt beside him. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They said the words together, as the last light faded in the west and grey day </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">became black night. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Hear my words, and bear witness to my  vow,” they recited, their voices </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">filling the twilit grove. “Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear </text>

<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The woods fell silent. “You knelt as boys,” Bowen Marsh intoned solemnly. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">“Rise now as men of the Night’s Watch.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon held out a hand to pull Sam back to his feet. The rangers gathered round </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to offer smiles and congratulations, all but the gnarled old forester Dywen. “Best we </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">be starting back, m’lord,” he said to Bowen Marsh. “Dark’s falling, and there’s </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="490" height="22" font="2">something in the smell o’ the night that I mislike.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">And suddenly Ghost was back, stalking softly between two weirwoods. <i>White </i></text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="582" height="22" font="4"><i>fur and red eyes</i>, Jon realized, disquieted. <i>Like the trees</i> . . .  </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The wolf had something in his jaws. Something black. “What’s he got there?” </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="308" height="22" font="2">asked Bowen Marsh, frowning. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="419" height="22" font="2">“To me, Ghost.” Jon knelt. “Bring it here.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="758" height="22" font="2">The direwolf trotted to him. Jon heard Samwell Tarly’s sharp intake of breath. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="503" height="22" font="2">“Gods be good,” Dywen muttered. “That’s a hand.” </text>

<text top="373" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and riding down mock warriors stuffed with straw. Ned watched Sandor Clegane </text>

<text top="704" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“A short lesson, and make certain you leave yourself time to bathe and </text>

<text top="759" left="108" width="244" height="22" font="2">“By midday,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa looked up from her food. “If she can have a dancing lesson, why won’t </text>

<text top="842" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I would gladly go with her, Lord Eddard,” Septa Mordane offered. “There </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was an hour later when Grand Maester Pycelle came to Eddard Stark in his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">solar. His shoulders slumped, as if the weight of the great maester’s chain around </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his neck had become too great to bear. “My lord,” he said, “King Robert is gone. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">The gods give him rest.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ned answered. “He hated rest. The gods give him love and laughter, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and the joy of righteous battle.” It was strange how empty he felt. He had been </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">expecting the visit, and yet with those words, something died within him. He would </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have given all his titles for the freedom to weep. . . but he was Robert’s Hand, and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the hour he dreaded had come. “Be so good as to summon the members of the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">council here to my solar,” he told Pycelle. The Tower of the Hand was as secure as </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="798" height="22" font="2">he and Tomard could make it; he could not say the same for the council chambers. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My lord?” Pycelle blinked. “Surely the affairs of the kingdom will keep till </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="427" height="22" font="2">the morrow, when our grief is not so fresh.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="565" height="22" font="2">Ned was quiet but firm. “I fear we must convene at once.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Pycelle bowed. “As the Hand commands.” He called his servants and sent </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them running, then gratefully accepted Ned’s offer of a chair and a cup of sweet </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">beer. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan Selmy was the first to answer the summons, immaculate in </text>

<text top="694" left="108" width="485" height="22" font="2">“Your place is here, Ser Barristan,” Ned told him. </text>

<text top="942" left="108" width="374" height="22" font="2">“When Lord Renly arrives,” Ned said. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="682" height="22" font="2">Varys gave him a sorrowful look. “I fear Lord Renly has left the city.” </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but there was nothing to be done for it. He drew out Robert’s last letter. “The king </text>

<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Renly and Grand Maester Pycelle stood witness as Robert sealed the letter, to be </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">opened by the council after his death. Ser Barristan, if you would be so kind?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard examined the paper. “King Robert’s </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seal, and unbroken.” He opened the letter and read. “Lord Eddard Stark is herein </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="738" height="22" font="2">named Protector of the Realm, to rule as regent until the heir comes of age.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>And as it happens, he is of age</i>, Ned reflected, but he did not give voice to the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thought. He trusted neither Pycelle nor Varys, and Ser Barristan was honor-bound </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to protect and defend the boy he thought his new king. The old knight would not </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">abandon Joffrey easily. The need for deceit was a bitter taste in his mouth, but Ned </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knew he must tread softly here, must keep his counsel and play the game until he </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was firmly established as regent. There would be time enough to deal with the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">succession when Arya and Sansa were safely back in Winterfell, and Lord Stannis </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">had returned to King’s Landing with all his power. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I would ask this council to confirm me as Lord Protector, as Robert wished,” </text>

<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned had expected Cersei to strike quickly; the summons came as no surprise. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“The king is dead,” he said, “but we shall go with you nonetheless. Tom, assemble </text>

<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger gave Ned his arm to help him down the steps. Varys, Pycelle, and </text>

<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crimson to be seen, but Ned was reassured by the number of gold cloaks visible on </text>

<text top="308" left="54" width="515" height="22" font="2">wondered if Joffrey would step down quite so easily. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Five knights of the Kingsguard—all but Ser Jaime and Ser Barristan—were </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">arrayed in  a crescent around the base of the throne. They were in full armor, </text>

<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">white shields strapped to their left arms. Cersei Lannister and her two younger </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">children stood behind Ser Boros and Ser Meryn. The queen wore a gown of sea-</text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">green silk, trimmed with Myrish lace as pale as foam. On her finger was a golden </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="746" height="22" font="2">ring with an emerald the size of a pigeon’s egg, on her head a matching tiara. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Above them, Prince Joffrey sat amidst the barbs and spikes in a cloth-of-gold </text>

<text top="639" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Behind the throne, twenty Lannister guardsmen waited with longswords </text>

<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the haft of an eight-foot-long spear tipped in black iron. They outnumbered the </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Joffrey stood. His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread; fifty roaring </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="584" height="22" font="2">“Those were the king’s words,” Ser Barristan said, shocked. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“We have a new king now,” Cersei Lannister replied. “Lord Eddard, when last </text>

<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Would that I could,” Ned said grimly. If she was so determined to force the </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="441" height="22" font="2">“<i>Liar!</i>” Joffrey screamed, his face reddening. </text>

<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard hesitated. In the blink of an eye he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="657" height="22" font="2">was surrounded by Stark guardsmen, bare steel in their mailed fists. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“And now the treason moves from words to deeds,” Cersei said. “Do you </text>

<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">metal, the Hound drew his longsword. The knights of the Kingsguard and twenty </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="607" height="22" font="2">Lannister guardsmen in crimson cloaks moved to support him. </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I want no bloodshed,” Ned told the queen. “Tell your men to lay down their </text>

<text top="970" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">With a single sharp thrust, the nearest gold cloak drove his spear into </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Forel the best? I will tell you now.” He touched the tip of his little finger lightly to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="588" height="22" font="2">his eyelid. “The seeing, the true seeing, that is the heart of it. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Hear me. The ships of Braavos sail as far as the winds blow, to lands strange </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and wonderful, and when they return their captains fetch queer animals to the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Sealord’s menagerie. Such animals as you have never seen, striped horses, great </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">spotted things with necks as long as stilts, hairy mouse-pigs as big as cows, stinging </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">manticores, tigers that carry their cubs in a pouch, terrible walking lizards with </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">scythes for claws. Syrio Forel has seen these things. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“On the day I am speaking of, the first sword was newly dead, and the Sealord </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sent for me. Many bravos had come to him, and as many had been sent away, none </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could say why. When I came into his presence, he was seated, and in his lap was a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fat yellow cat. He  told me that one of his captains had brought the beast to him, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">from an island beyond the sunrise. ‘Have you ever seen her like?’ he asked of me. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And to him I said, ‘Each night in the alleys of Braavos I see a thousand like </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">him,’ and the Sealord laughed, and that day I was named the first sword.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="467" height="22" font="2">Arya screwed up her face. “I don’t understand.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Syrio clicked his teeth together. “The cat was an ordinary cat, no more. The </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">others expected a fabulous beast, so that is what they saw. How large it was, they </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">said. It was no larger than any other cat, only fat from indolence, for the Sealord fed </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it from his own table. What curious small ears, they said. Its ears had been chewed </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">away in kitten fights. And it was plainly a tomcat, yet the Sealord said ‘her,’ and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="449" height="22" font="2">that is what the others saw. Are you hearing?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="486" height="22" font="2">Arya thought about it. “You saw what was there.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Just so. Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin.  <i>Then</i> </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="296" height="22" font="2">“Just so,” said Arya, grinning. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Syrio Forel allowed himself a smile. “I am thinking that when we are reaching </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="691" height="22" font="2">this Winterfell of yours, it will be time to put this needle in your hand.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="495" height="22" font="2">“Yes!” Arya said eagerly. “Wait till I show Jon—” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Behind her the great wooden doors of the Small Hall flew open with a </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="315" height="22" font="2">resounding crash. Arya whirled. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A knight of the Kingsguard stood beneath the arch of the door with five </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lannister guardsmen arrayed behind him. He was in full armor, but his visor was </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">up. Arya remembered his droopy eyes and rustcolored whiskers from when he had </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">come to Winterfell with the king: Ser Meryn Trant. The red cloaks wore mail shirts </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over boiled leather and steel caps with lion crests. “Arya Stark,” the knight said, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">“come with us, child.” </text>

<page number="426" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">Arya chewed her lip uncertainly. “What do you want?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="310" height="22" font="2">“Your father wants to see you.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya took a step forward, but Syrio Forel held her by the arm. “And why is it </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in the place of his own? I am </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">wondering.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Mind your place, dancing master,” Ser Meryn said. “This is no concern of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">yours.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My father wouldn’t send <i>you</i>,” Arya said. She snatched up her stick sword. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">The Lannisters laughed. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Put down the stick, girl,” Ser Meryn told her. “I am a Sworn Brother of the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard, the White Swords.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So was the Kingslayer when he killed the old king,” Arya said. “I don’t have </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="306" height="22" font="2">to go with you if I don’t want.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Meryn Trant ran out of patience. “Take her,” he said to his men. He </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">lowered the visor of his helm. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Three of them started forward, chainmail clinking softly with each step. Arya </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was suddenly afraid.  <i>Fear cuts deeper than swords</i>,  she told herself, to slow the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">racing of her heart. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Syrio Forel stepped between them, tapping his wooden sword lightly against </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his boot. “You will be stopping there. Are you men or dogs that you would threaten </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">a child?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="523" height="22" font="2">“Out of the way, old man,” one of the red cloaks said. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Syrio’s stick came whistling up and rang against his helm. “I am Syrio Forel, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="548" height="22" font="2">and you will now be speaking to me with more respect.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Bald bastard.” The man yanked free his longsword. The stick moved again, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">blindingly fast. Arya heard a loud crack as the sword went clattering to the stone </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">floor. “My <i>hand</i>,” the guardsman yelped, cradling his broken fingers. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">“You are quick, for a dancing master,” said Ser Meryn. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="422" height="22" font="2">“You are slow, for a knight,” Syrio replied. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Kill the Braavosi and bring me the girl,” the knight in the white armor </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">commanded. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Four Lannister guardsmen unsheathed their swords. The fifth, with the broken </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">fingers, spat and pulled free a dagger with his left hand. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Syrio Forel clicked his teeth together, sliding into his water dancer’s stance, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">presenting only his side to the foe. “Arya child,” he called out, never looking, never </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">taking his eyes off the Lannisters, “we are done with dancing for the day. Best you </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="349" height="22" font="2">are going now. Run to your father.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Arya did not want to leave him, but he had taught her to do as he said. “<i>Swift </i></text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="4"><i>as a deer</i>,” she whispered. </text>
</page>
<page number="427" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="498" height="22" font="2">“Just so,” said Syrio Forel as the Lannisters closed. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Arya retreated, her own sword stick clutched tightly in her hand. Watching </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him now, she realized that Syrio had only been toying with her when they dueled. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The red cloaks came at him from three sides with steel in their hands. They had </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">chainmail over their chest and arms, and steel codpieces sewn into their pants, but </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">only leather on their legs. Their hands were bare, and the caps they wore had </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">noseguards, but no visor over the eyes. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Syrio did not wait for them to reach him, but spun to his left. Arya had never </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seen a man move as fast. He checked one sword with his stick and whirled away </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from a second. Off balance, the second man lurched into the first. Syrio put a boot </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to his back and the red cloaks went down together. The third guard came leaping </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over them, slashing at the water dancer’s head. Syrio ducked under his blade and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thrust upward. The guardsman fell screaming as blood welled from the wet red hole </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">where his left eye had been. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The fallen men were getting up. Syrio kicked one in the face and snatched the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">steel cap off the other’s head. The dagger man stabbed at him. Syrio caught the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">thrust in the helmet and shattered the man’s kneecap with his stick. The last red </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cloak shouted a curse and charged, hacking down with both hands on his sword. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Syrio rolled right, and the butcher’s cut caught the helmetless man between neck </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and shoulder as he struggled to his knees. The longsword crunched  through mail </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and leather and flesh. The man on his knees shrieked. Before his killer could </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wrench free his blade, Syrio jabbed him in the apple of his throat. The guardsman </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">gave a choked cry and staggered back, clutching at his neck, his face blackening. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Five men were down, dead, or dying by the time Arya reached the back door </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that opened on the kitchen. She heard Ser Meryn Trant curse. “Bloody oafs,” he </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="474" height="22" font="2">swore, drawing his longsword from its scabbard. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Syrio Forel resumed his stance and clicked his teeth together. “Arya child,” he </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">called out, never looking at her, “be gone now.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Look with your eyes</i>, he had said. She saw: the knight in his pale armor head </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to foot, legs, throat, and hands sheathed in metal, eyes hidden behind his high white </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">helm, and in his hand cruel steel. Against that: Syrio, in a leather vest, with a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">wooden sword in his hand. “Syrio, <i>run</i>,” she screamed. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The first sword of Braavos does not run,” he sang as Ser Meryn slashed at </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">him. Syrio danced away from his cut, his stick a blur. In a heartbeat, he had </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bounced blows off the knight’s temple, elbow, and throat, the wood ringing against </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the metal of helm, gauntlet, and gorget. Arya stood frozen. Ser Meryn advanced; </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Syrio backed away. He checked the next blow, spun away from the second, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">deflected the third. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The fourth sliced his stick in two, splintering the wood and shearing through </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="280" height="22" font="2">Sobbing, Arya spun and ran. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">She plunged through the kitchens and buttery, blind with panic, weaving </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">between cooks and potboys. A baker’s helper stepped in front of her, holding a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wooden tray. Arya bowled her over, scattering fragrant loaves of fresh-baked bread </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">on the floor. She heard shouting behind her as she spun around a portly butcher who </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="768" height="22" font="2">stood gaping at her with a cleaver in his hands. His arms were red to the elbow. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">All that Syrio Forel had taught her went racing through her head.  <i>Swift as a </i></text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>deer. Quiet as a shadow. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Quick as a snake. Calm as </i></text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>still water. Fear cuts deeper than swords. Strong as a bear. Fierce as a wolverine. </i></text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>Fear cuts deeper than swords. The man who fears losing has already lost. Fear cuts </i></text>

<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The grip of her wooden sword was slick with sweat, and Arya was breathing hard </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">when she reached the turret stair. For an instant she froze. Up or down? Up would </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">take her to the covered bridge that spanned the small court to the Tower of the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Hand, but that would be the way they’d expect her to go, for certain. <i>Never do what </i></text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>they expect</i>, Syrio once said. Arya went down, around and around, leaping over the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">narrow stone steps two and three at a time. She emerged in a cavernous vaulted </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">cellar, surrounded by casks of ale stacked twenty feet tall. The only light came </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">through narrow slanting windows high in the wall. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The cellar was a dead end. There was no way out but the way she had come </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in. She dare not go back up those steps, but she couldn’t stay here, either. She had </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="2">to find her father and tell him what had happened. Her father would protect her. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Arya thrust her wooden sword through her belt and began to climb, leaping </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from cask to cask until she could reach the window. Grasping the stone with both </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hands, she pulled herself up. The wall was three feet thick, the window a tunnel </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slanting up and out. Arya wriggled toward daylight. When her head reached ground </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="587" height="22" font="2">level, she peered across the bailey to the Tower of the Hand. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The stout wooden door hung splintered and broken, as if by axes. A dead man </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sprawled facedown on the steps, his cloak tangled beneath him, the back of his </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">mailed shirt soaked red. The corpse’s cloak was grey wool trimmed with white </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="626" height="22" font="2">satin, she saw with sudden terror. She could not tell who he was. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>No</i>,” she whispered. What was happening? Where was her father? Why had </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the red cloaks come for her? She remembered what the man with the yellow beard </text>

<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>second?</i>  Arya felt tears in her eyes. She held her breath to listen. She heard the </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been. They could kill her father too, and her if they caught her. “<i>Fear cuts deeper </i></text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>than swords</i>,” she said aloud, but it was no good pretending to be a water dancer, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Syrio had been a water dancer and the white knight had probably killed him, and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">anyhow she was only a little girl with a wooden stick, alone and afraid. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She squirmed out into the yard, glancing around warily as she climbed to her </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet. The castle seemed deserted. The Red Keep was <i>never</i> deserted. All the people </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">must be hiding inside, their doors barred. Arya glanced up longingly at her </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bedchamber, then moved away from the Tower of the Hand, keeping close to the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">wall as she slid from shadow to shadow. She pretended she was chasing </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="761" height="22" font="2">cats. . . except she was the cat now, and if they caught her, they would kill her. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Moving between buildings and over walls, keeping stone to her back wherever </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">possible so no one could surprise her, Arya reached the stables almost without </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">incident. A dozen gold cloaks in mail and plate ran past as she was edging across </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the inner bailey, but without knowing whose side they were on, she hunched down </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">low in the shadows and let them pass. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Hullen, who had been master of horse at Winterfell as long as Arya could </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remember, was slumped on the ground by the stable door. He had been stabbed so </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">many times it looked as if his tunic was patterned with scarlet flowers. Arya was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">certain he was dead, but when she crept closer, his eyes opened. “Arya Underfoot,” </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">he whispered. “You  must. . . warn your. . . your lord father. . .”  Frothy red spittle </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bubbled from his mouth. The master of horse closed his eyes again and said no </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">more. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Inside were more bodies; a groom she had played with, and three of her </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">father’s household guard. A wagon, laden with crates and chests, stood abandoned </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">near the door of the stable. The dead men must have been loading it for the trip to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the docks when they were attacked. Arya snuck closer. One of the corpses was </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Desmond, who’d shown her his longsword and promised to protect her father. He </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lay on his back, staring blindly at the ceiling as flies crawled across his eyes. Close </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to him was a dead man in the red cloak and lion-crest helm of the Lannisters. Only </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">one, though. <i>Every northerner is worth ten of these southron swords</i>, Desmond had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">told her. “You <i>liar</i>!” she said, kicking his body in a sudden fury. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The animals were restless in their stalls, whickering and snorting at the scent </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of blood. Arya’s only plan was to saddle a horse and flee, away from the castle and </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the city. All she had to do was stay on the kingsroad and it would take her back to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="521" height="22" font="2">Winterfell. She took a bridle and harness off the wall. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">As she crossed in back of the wagon, a fallen chest caught her eye. It must </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have been knocked down in the fight or dropped as it was being loaded. The wood </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">had split, the lid opening to spill the chest’s contents across the ground. Arya </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">recognized silks and satins and velvets she never wore. She might need warm </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="502" height="22" font="2">clothes on the kingsroad, though. . . and besides. . .  </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya knelt in the dirt among the scattered clothes. She found a heavy woolen </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cloak, a velvet skirt and a silk tunic and some smallclothes, a dress her mother had </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">embroidered for her, a silver baby bracelet she might sell. Shoving the broken lid </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">out of the way, she groped inside the chest for Needle. She had hidden it way down </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">at the bottom, under everything, but her stuff had all been jumbled around when the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">chest was dropped. For a moment Arya was afraid someone had found the sword </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="736" height="22" font="2">and stolen it. Then her fingers felt the hardness of metal under a satin gown. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="459" height="22" font="2">“<i>There </i>she is,” a voice hissed close behind her. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Startled, Arya whirled. A stableboy stood behind her, a smirk on his face, his </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">filthy white undertunic peeking out from beneath a soiled jerkin. His boots were </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">covered with manure, and he had a pitchfork in one hand. “Who are you?” she </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">asked. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="702" height="22" font="2">“She don’t know me,” he said, “but I knows her, oh, yes. The wolf girl.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Help me saddle a horse,” Arya pleaded, reaching back into the chest, groping </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="639" height="22" font="2">for Needle. “My father’s the Hand of the King, he’ll reward you.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Father’s <i>dead</i>,” the boy said. He shuffled toward her. “It’s the queen who’ll </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="346" height="22" font="2">be rewarding me. Come here, girl.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="523" height="22" font="2">“<i>Stay away!</i>” Her fingers closed around Needle’s hilt. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="409" height="22" font="2">“I says, <i>come</i>.” He grabbed her arm, hard. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Everything Syrio Forel had ever taught her vanished in a heartbeat. In that </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">instant of sudden terror, the only lesson Arya could remember was the one Jon </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="338" height="22" font="2">Snow had given her, the very first. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She stuck him with the pointy end, driving the blade upward with a wild, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">hysterical strength. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">came out between his shoulder blades. The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">soft noise, something between a gasp and a sigh. His hands closed around the blade. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="708" height="22" font="2">“Oh, gods,” he moaned, as his undertunic began to redden. “Take it out.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="294" height="22" font="2">When she took it out, he died. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The horses were screaming. Arya stood over the body, still and frightened in </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the face of death. Blood had gushed from the boy’s mouth as he collapsed, and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">more was seeping from the slit in his belly, pooling beneath his body. His palms </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were cut where he’d grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly, Needle red in </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her hand. She had to get away, someplace far from here, someplace safe away from </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">the stableboy’s accusing eyes. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She snatched up the bridle and harness again and ran to her mare, but as she </text>

<page number="431" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lifted the saddle to the horse’s back, Arya realized with a sudden sick dread that the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">castle gates would be closed. Even the postern doors would likely be guarded. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Maybe the guards wouldn’t recognize her. If they thought she was a boy, perhaps </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">they’d let her. . . no, they’d have orders not to let  <i>anyone</i>  out, it wouldn’t matter </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="294" height="22" font="2">whether they knew her or not. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">But there was another way out of the castle. . .  </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The saddle slipped from Arya’s fingers and fell to the dirt with a thump and a </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">puff of dust. Could she find the room with the monsters again? She wasn’t certain, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">yet she knew she had to try. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She found the clothing she’d gathered and slipped into the cloak, concealing </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Needle beneath its folds. The rest of her things she tied in a roll. With the bundle </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">under her arm, she crept to the far end of the stable. Unlatching the back door, she </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">peeked out anxiously. She could hear the distant sound of swordplay, and the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shivery wail of a man screaming in pain across the bailey. She would need to go </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">down the serpentine steps, past the small kitchen and the pig yard, that was how </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">she’d gone last time, chasing the black tomcat. . . only that would take her right past </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the barracks of the gold cloaks. She couldn’t go that way. Arya tried to think of </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">another way. If she crossed to the other side of the castle, she could creep along the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">river wall and through the little godswood. . . but first she’d have to cross the yard, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="426" height="22" font="2">in the plain view of the guards on the walls. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She had never seen so many men on the walls. Gold cloaks, most of them, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">armed with spears. Some of them knew her by sight. What would they do if they </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saw her running across the yard? She’d look so small from up there, would they be </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="422" height="22" font="2">able to tell who she was? Would they care? </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She had to leave <i>now</i>, she told herself, but when the moment came, she was </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">too frightened to move. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Calm as still water</i>, a small voice whispered in her ear. Arya was so startled </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she almost dropped her bundle. She looked around wildly, but there was no one in </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="507" height="22" font="2">the stable but her, and the horses, and the dead men. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="4"><i>Quiet as a shadow</i>, she heard. Was it her own voice, or Syrio’s? She could not </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">tell, yet somehow it calmed her fears. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="287" height="22" font="2">She stepped out of the stable. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was the scariest thing she’d ever done. She wanted to run and hide, but she </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">made herself <i>walk</i> across the yard, slowly, putting one foot in front of the other as if </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she had all the time in the world and no reason to be afraid of anyone. She thought </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">she could feel their eyes, like bugs crawling on her skin under her clothes. Arya </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">never looked up. If she saw them watching, all her courage would desert her, she </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knew, and she would drop the bundle of clothes and run and cry like a baby, and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">then they would have her. She kept her gaze on the ground. By the time she reached </text>
</page>
<page number="432" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the shadow of the royal sept on the far side of the yard, Arya was cold with sweat, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">but no one had raised the hue and cry. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The sept was open and empty. Inside, half a hundred prayer candles burned in </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a fragrant silence. Arya figured the gods would never miss two. She stuffed them up </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her sleeves, and left by a back window. Sneaking back to the alley where she had </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cornered the one-eared tom was easy, but after that she got lost. She crawled in and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">out of windows, hopped over walls, and felt her way through dark cellars, quiet as a </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shadow. Once she heard a woman weeping. It took her more than an hour to find </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the low narrow window that slanted down to the dungeon where the monsters </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">waited. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She tossed her bundle through and doubled back to light her candle. That was </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chancy; the fire she’d remembered seeing had burnt down to embers, and she heard </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">voices as she was blowing on the coals. Cupping her fingers around the flickering </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">candle, she went out the window as they were coming in the door, without ever </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="313" height="22" font="2">getting a glimpse of who it was. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">This time the monsters did not frighten her. They seemed almost old friends. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Arya held the candle over her head. With each step she took, the shadows moved </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">against the walls, as if they were turning to watch her pass. “<i>Dragons</i>,” she </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">whispered. She slid Needle out from under her cloak. The slender blade seemed </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">very small and the dragons very big, yet somehow Arya felt better with steel in her </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">hand. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The long windowless hall beyond the door was as black as she remembered. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">She held Needle in her left hand, her sword hand, the candle in her right fist. Hot </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wax ran down across her knuckles. The entrance to the well had been to the left, so </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Arya went right. Part of her wanted to run, but she was afraid of snuffing out her </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">candle. She heard the faint squeaking of rats and glimpsed a pair of tiny glowing </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">eyes on the edge of the light, but rats did not scare her. Other things did. It would be </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">so easy to hide here, as she had hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">beard. She could almost see the stableboy standing against the wall, his hands </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in his palms </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">where Needle had cut him. He might be waiting to grab her as she passed. He </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">would see her candle coming a long way off. Maybe she would be better off </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">without the light. . .  </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Fear cuts deeper than swords</i>, the quiet voice inside her whispered. Suddenly </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Arya remembered the crypts at Winterfell. They were a lot scarier than this place, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she told herself. She’d been just a little girl the first time she saw them. Her brother </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robb had taken them down, her and Sansa and baby Bran, who’d been no bigger </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">than Rickon was now. They’d only had one candle between them, and Bran’s eyes </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had gotten as big as saucers as he stared at the stone faces of the Kings of Winter, </text>

<page number="433" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">with their wolves at their feet and their iron swords across their laps. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb took them all the way down to the end, past Grandfather and Brandon </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and Lyanna, to show them their own tombs. Sansa kept looking at the stubby little </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">candle, anxious that it might go out. Old Nan had told her there were spiders down </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">here, and rats as big as dogs. Robb smiled when she said that. “There are worse </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">things than spiders and rats,” he whispered. “This is where the dead walk.” That </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was when they heard the sound, low and deep and shivery. Baby Bran had clutched </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="153" height="22" font="2">at Arya’s hand. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When the spirit stepped out of the open tomb, pale white and moaning for </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blood, Sansa ran shrieking for the stairs, and Bran wrapped himself around Robb’s </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leg, sobbing. Arya stood her ground and gave the spirit a punch. It was only Jon, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">covered with flour. “You <i>stupid</i>,” she told him, “you scared the baby,” but Jon and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">Robb just laughed and laughed, and pretty soon Bran and Arya were laughing too. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">terrors for her. The stableboy was dead, she’d killed him, and if he jumped out at </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her she’d kill him again. She was going home. Everything would be better once she </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="589" height="22" font="2">was home again, safe behind Winterfell’s grey granite walls. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her footsteps sent soft echoes hurrying ahead of her as Arya plunged deeper </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="175" height="22" font="2">into the darkness. </text>

<text top="235" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>
<text top="262" left="122" width="356" height="22" font="2">hey came for Sansa on the third day. </text>
<text top="290" left="176" width="699" height="22" font="2">She chose a simple dress of dark grey wool, plainly cut but richly </text>
<text top="318" left="122" width="748" height="22" font="2">embroidered around the collar and sleeves. Her fingers felt thick and clumsy </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">as she struggled with the silver fastenings without the benefit of servants. Jeyne </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Poole had been confined with her, but Jeyne was useless. Her face was puffy from </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">all her crying, and she could not seem to stop sobbing about her father. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I’m certain your father is well,” Sansa told her when she had finally gotten </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the dress buttoned right. “I’ll ask the queen to let you see him.” She thought that </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">kindness might lift Jeyne’s spirits, but the other girl just looked at her with red, </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">swollen eyes and began to cry all the harder. She was such a <i>child</i>. </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Sansa had wept too, the first day. Even within the stout walls of Maegor’s </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Holdfast, with her door closed and barred, it was hard not to be terrified when the </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">killing began. She had grown up to the sound of steel in the yard, and scarcely a day </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of her life had passed without hearing the clash of sword on sword, yet somehow </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knowing that the fighting was real made all the difference in the world. She heard it </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as she had never heard it before, and there were other sounds as well, grunts of pain, </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">angry curses, shouts for help, and the moans of wounded and dying men. In the </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="554" height="22" font="2">songs, the knights never screamed nor begged for mercy. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">So she wept, pleading through her door for them to tell her what was </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">happening, calling for her father, for Septa Mordane, for the king, for her gallant </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">prince. If the men guarding her heard her pleas, they gave no answer. The only time </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the door opened was late that night, when they thrust Jeyne Poole inside, bruised </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and shaking. “<i>They’re killing everyone</i>,” the steward’s daughter had shrieked at her. </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She went on and on. The Hound had broken down her door with a warhammer, she </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said. There were bodies on the stair of the Tower of the Hand, and the steps were </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slick with blood. Sansa dried her own tears as she struggled to comfort her friend. </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="740" height="22" font="2">They went to sleep in the same bed, cradled in each other’s arms like sisters. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The second day was even worse. The room where Sansa had been confined </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was at the top of the highest tower of Maegor’s Holdfast. From its window, she </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">could see that the heavy iron portcullis in the gatehouse was down, and the </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">drawbridge drawn up over the deep dry moat that separated the keep-within-a-keep </text>
<text top="258" left="54" width="96" height="101" font="6">T </text>
</page>
<page number="435" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">from the larger castle that surrounded it. Lannister guardsmen prowled the walls </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with spears and crossbows to hand. The fighting was over, and the silence of the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grave had settled over the Red Keep. The only sounds were Jeyne Poole’s endless </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="196" height="22" font="2">whimpers and sobs. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They were fed—hard cheese and fresh-baked bread and milk to break their </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fast, roast chicken and greens at midday, and a late supper of beef and barley </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stew—but the servants who brought the meals would not answer Sansa’s questions. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">That evening, some women brought her clothes from the Tower of the Hand, and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">some of Jeyne’s things as well, but they seemed nearly as frightened as Jeyne, and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when she tried to talk to them, they fled from her as if she had the grey plague. The </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">guards outside the door still refused to let them leave the room. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Please, I need to speak to the queen again,” Sansa told them, as she told </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">everyone she saw that day. “She’ll want to talk to me, I know she will. Tell her I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">want to see her, please. If not the queen, then Prince Joffrey, if you’d be so kind. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="345" height="22" font="2">We’re to marry when we’re older.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">At sunset on the second day, a great bell began to ring. Its voice was deep and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sonorous, and the long slow clanging filled Sansa with a sense of dread. The ringing </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">went on and on, and after a while they heard other bells answering from the Great </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill. The sound rumbled across the city like thunder, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">warning of the storm to come. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“What is it?” Jeyne asked, covering her ears. “Why are they ringing the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">bells?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The king is dead.” Sansa could not say how she knew it, yet she did. The </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">slow, endless clanging filled their room, as mournful as a dirge. Had some enemy </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stormed the castle and murdered King Robert? Was that the meaning of the fighting </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="158" height="22" font="2">they had heard? </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She went to sleep wondering, restless, and fearful. Was her beautiful Joffrey </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the king now? Or had they killed him too? She was afraid for him, and for her </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="563" height="22" font="2">father. If only they would tell her what was happening. . .  </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That night Sansa dreamt of Joffrey on the throne, with herself seated beside </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him in a gown of woven gold. She had a crown on her head, and everyone she had </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="686" height="22" font="2">ever known came before her, to bend the knee and say their courtesies. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The next morning, the morning of the third day, Ser Boros Blount of the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard came to escort her to the queen. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Boros was an ugly man with a broad chest and short, bandy legs. His nose </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was flat, his cheeks baggy with jowls, his hair grey and brittle. Today he wore white </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">velvet, and his snowy cloak was fastened with a lion brooch. The beast had the soft </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">sheen of gold, and his eyes were tiny rubies. “You look very handsome and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">splendid this morning, Ser Boros,” Sansa told him. A lady remembered her </text>
</page>
<page number="436" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">courtesies, and she was resolved to be a lady no matter what. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And you, my lady,” Ser Boros said in a flat voice. “Her Grace awaits. Come </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">with me.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">There were guards outside her door, Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and lion-crested helms. Sansa made herself smile at them pleasantly and bid them a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">good morning as she passed. It was the first time she had been allowed outside the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">chamber since Ser Arys Oakheart had led her there two mornings past. “To keep </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">you safe, my sweet one,” Queen Cersei had told her. “Joffrey would never forgive </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">me if anything happened to his precious.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa had expected that Ser Boros would escort her to the royal apartments, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but instead he led her out of Maegor’s Holdfast. The bridge was down again. Some </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">workmen were lowering a man on ropes into the depths of the dry moat. When </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sansa peered down, she saw a body impaled on the huge iron spikes below. She </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">averted her eyes quickly, afraid to ask, afraid to look too long, afraid he might be </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">someone she knew. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They found Queen Cersei in the council chambers, seated at the head of a long </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">table littered with papers, candles, and blocks of sealing wax. The room was as </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">splendid as any that Sansa had ever seen. She stared in awe at the carved wooden </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="515" height="22" font="2">screen and the twin sphinxes that sat beside the door. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace,” Ser Boros  said when they were ushered inside by another of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="770" height="22" font="2">the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon of the curiously dead face, “I’ve brought the girl.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa had hoped Joffrey might be with her. Her prince was not there, but three </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of the king’s councillors were. Lord Petyr Baelish sat on the queen’s left hand, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle at the end of the table, while Lord Varys hovered over them, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">smelling flowery. All of them were clad in black, she realized with a feeling of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="277" height="22" font="2">dread. Mourning clothes. . .  </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The queen wore a high-collared  black silk gown, with a hundred dark red </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">rubies sewn into her bodice, covering her from neck to bosom. They were cut in the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shape of teardrops, as if the queen were weeping blood. Cersei smiled to see her, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Sansa thought it was the sweetest and saddest smile she had ever seen. “Sansa, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">my sweet child,” she said, “I know you’ve been asking for me. I’m sorry that I </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could not send for you sooner. Matters have been very unsettled, and I have not had </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="634" height="22" font="2">a moment. I trust my people have been taking good care of you?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Everyone has been very sweet and pleasant, Your Grace, thank you ever so </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">much for asking,” Sansa said politely. “Only, well, no one will talk to us or tell us </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">what’s happened. . .” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="296" height="22" font="2">“Us?” Cersei seemed puzzled. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We put the steward’s girl in with her,” Ser Boros said. “We did not know </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">what else to do with her.” </text>
</page>
<page number="437" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The queen frowned. “Next time, you will ask,” she said, her voice sharp. “The </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="697" height="22" font="2">gods only know what sort of tales she’s been filling Sansa’s head with.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Jeyne’s scared,” Sansa said. “She won’t stop crying. I promised her I’d ask if </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">she could see her father.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="440" height="22" font="2">Old Grand Maester Pycelle lowered his eyes. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Her father is well, isn’t he?” Sansa said anxiously. She knew there had been </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fighting, but surely no one would harm a steward. Vayon Poole did not even wear a </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">sword. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Queen Cersei looked at each of the councillors in turn. “I won’t have Sansa </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="754" height="22" font="2">fretting needlessly. What shall we do with this little friend of hers, my lords?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="517" height="22" font="2">Lord Petyr leaned forward. “I’ll find a place for her.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="321" height="22" font="2">“Not in the city,” said the queen. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="286" height="22" font="2">“Do you take me for a fool?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The queen ignored that. “Ser Boros, escort this girl to Lord Petyr’s apartments </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and instruct his people to keep her there until he comes for her. Tell her that </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Littlefinger will be taking her to see her father, that ought to calm her down. I want </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">her gone before Sansa returns to her chamber.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“As you command, Your Grace,” Ser Boros said. He bowed deeply, spun on </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">his heel, and took his leave, his long white cloak stirring the air behind him. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa was confused. “I don’t understand,” she said. “Where is Jeyne’s father? </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Why can’t Ser Boros take her to him instead of Lord Petyr having to do it?” She </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had promised herself she would be a lady, gentle as the queen and as strong as her </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mother, the Lady Catelyn, but all of a sudden she was scared again. For a second </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she thought she might cry. “Where are you sending her? She hasn’t done anything </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">wrong, she’s a good girl.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“She’s upset you,” the queen said gently. “We can’t be having that. Not </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">another word, now. Lord Baelish will see that Jeyne’s well taken care of, I promise </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">you.” She patted the chair beside her. “Sit down, Sansa. I want to talk to you.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa seated herself beside the queen. Cersei smiled again, but that did not </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">make her feel any less anxious. Varys was wringing his soft hands together, Grand </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Maester Pycelle kept his sleepy eyes on the papers in front of him, but she could </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">feel Littlefinger staring. Something about the way the small man looked at her made </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">Sansa feel as though she had no clothes on. Goose bumps pimpled her skin. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Sweet Sansa,” Queen Cersei said, laying a soft hand on her wrist. “Such a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="691" height="22" font="2">beautiful child. I do hope you know how much Joffrey and I love you.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You <i>do?</i>” Sansa said, breathless. Littlefinger was forgotten. Her prince loved </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">her. Nothing else mattered. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The queen smiled. “I think of you almost as my own daughter. And I know </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the love you bear for Joffrey.” She gave a weary shake of her head. “I am afraid we </text>

<page number="438" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="709" height="22" font="2">have some grave news about your lord father. You must be brave, child.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="477" height="22" font="2">Her quiet words gave Sansa a chill. “What is it?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="468" height="22" font="2">“Your father is a traitor, dear,” Lord Varys said. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle lifted his ancient head. “With my own ears, I heard </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Lord Eddard swear to our beloved King Robert that he would protect the young </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">princes as if they were his own sons. And yet the moment the king was dead, he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="713" height="22" font="2">called the small council together to steal Prince Joffrey’s rightful throne.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="564" height="22" font="2">“No,” Sansa blurted. “He wouldn’t do that. He <i>wouldn’t!</i>” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The queen picked up a letter. The paper was torn and stiff with dried blood, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but the broken seal was her father’s, the direwolf stamped in pale wax. “We found </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">this on the captain of your household guard, Sansa. It is a letter to my late </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">husband’s brother Stannis, inviting him to take the crown.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Please, Your Grace, there’s been a mistake.” Sudden panic made her dizzy </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and faint. “Please, send for my father, he’ll tell you, he would never write such a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="303" height="22" font="2">letter, the king was his friend.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Robert thought so,” said the queen. “This betrayal would have broken his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">heart. The gods  are kind, that he did not live to see it.” She sighed. “Sansa, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">sweetling, you must see what a dreadful position this has left us in. You are </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">innocent of any wrong, we all know that, and yet you are the daughter of a traitor. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">How can I allow you to marry my son?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“But I <i>love</i> him,” Sansa wailed, confused and frightened. What did they mean </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to do to her? What had they done to her father? It was not supposed to happen this </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">way. She had to wed Joffrey, they were betrothed, he was promised to her, she had </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">even dreamed about it. It wasn’t fair to take him away from her on account of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">whatever her father might have done. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“How well I know that, child,” Cersei said, her voice so kind and sweet. “Why </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">else should you have come to me and told me of your father’s plan to send you </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="303" height="22" font="2">away from us, if not for love?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It <i>was</i> for love,” Sansa said in a rush. “Father wouldn’t even give me leave to </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">say farewell.” She was the good girl, the obedient girl, but she had felt as wicked as </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Arya that morning, sneaking away from Septa Mordane, defying her lord father. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">She had never done anything so willful before, and she would never have done it </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">then if she hadn’t loved Joffrey as much as she did. “He was going to take me back </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to Winterfell and marry me to some hedge knight, even though it was Joff I wanted. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">I told him, but he wouldn’t listen.” The king had been her last hope. The king could </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>command</i> Father to let her stay in King’s Landing and marry Prince Joffrey, Sansa </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">knew he could, but the king had always frightened her. He was loud and rough-</text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">voiced and drunk as often as not, and he would probably have just sent her back to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lord Eddard, if they even let her see him. So she went to the queen instead, and </text>
</page>
<page number="439" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">poured out her heart, and Cersei had listened and thanked her sweetly. . . only then </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Ser Arys had escorted her to the high room in Maegor’s Holdfast and posted guards, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and a few hours later, the fighting had begun outside. “Please,” she finished, “you </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>have</i> to let me marry Joffrey, I’ll be ever so good a wife to him, you’ll see. I’ll be a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="308" height="22" font="2">queen just like you, I promise.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Queen Cersei looked to the others. “My lords of the council, what do you say </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">to her plea?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The poor child,” murmured Varys. “A love so true and innocent, Your Grace, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">it would be cruel to deny it. . . and yet, what can we do? Her father stands </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="770" height="22" font="2">condemned.” His soft hands washed each other in a gesture of helpless distress. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A child born of traitor’s seed will find that betrayal comes naturally to her,” </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said Grand Maester Pycelle. “She is a sweet thing now, but in ten years, who can </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="340" height="22" font="2">say what treasons she may hatch?” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>No</i>,” Sansa said, horrified. “I’m not, I’d never. . . I wouldn’t betray Joffrey, I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">love him, I swear it, I do.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, so poignant,” said Varys. “And yet, it is truly said that blood runs truer </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">than oaths.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“She reminds me of the mother, not the father,” Lord Petyr Baelish said </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">quietly. “Look at her. The hair, the eyes. She is the very image of Cat at the same </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">age.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The queen looked at her, troubled, and yet Sansa could see kindness in her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">clear green eyes. “Child,” she said, “if I could truly believe that you were not like </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">your father, why nothing should please me more than to see you wed to my Joffrey. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">I know he loves you with all his heart.” She sighed. “And yet, I fear that Lord Varys </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and the Grand Maester have the right of it. The blood will tell. I have only to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">remember how your sister set her wolf on my son.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I’m not like Arya,” Sansa blurted. “She has the traitor’s blood, not me. I’m </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>good</i>,  ask Septa Mordane, she’ll tell you, I only want to be Joffrey’s loyal and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">loving wife.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She felt the weight of Cersei’s eyes as the queen studied her face. “I believe </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you mean it, child.” She turned to face the others. “My lords, it seems to me that if </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the rest of her kin were to remain loyal in this terrible time, that would go a long </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">way toward laying our fears to rest.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his huge soft beard, his wide brow furrowed in </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="2">thought. “Lord Eddard has three sons.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Mere boys,” Lord Petyr said with a shrug. “I should be more concerned with </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">Lady Catelyn and the Tullys.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The queen took Sansa’s hand in both of hers. “Child, do you know your </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="86" height="22" font="2">letters?” </text>
</page>
<page number="440" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sansa nodded nervously. She could read and write better than any of her </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="435" height="22" font="2">brothers, although she was hopeless at sums. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="742" height="22" font="2">“I am pleased to hear that. Perhaps there is hope for you and Joffrey still. . .” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="304" height="22" font="2">“What do you want me to do?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You must write your lady mother, and your brother, the eldest. . . what is his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">name?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="198" height="22" font="2">“Robb,” Sansa said. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The word of your lord father’s treason will no doubt reach them soon. Better </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">that it should come from you. You must tell them how Lord Eddard betrayed his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">king.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa wanted Joffrey desperately, but she did not think she had the courage to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">do as the queen was asking. “But he never. . . I don’t. . . Your Grace, I wouldn’t </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">know what to say . . .” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The queen patted her hand. “We will tell you what to write, child. The </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">important thing is that you urge Lady Catelyn and your brother to keep the king’s </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">peace.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It will go hard for them if they don’t,” said Grand Maester Pycelle. “By the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="679" height="22" font="2">love you bear them, you must urge them to walk the path of wisdom.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Your lady mother will no doubt fear for you dreadfully,” the queen  said. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“You must tell her that you are well and in our care, that we are treating you gently </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and seeing to your every want. Bid them to come to King’s Landing and pledge </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">their fealty to Joffrey when he takes his throne. If they do that. . . why, then we shall </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">know that there is no taint in your blood, and when you come into the flower of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">your womanhood, you shall wed the king in the Great Sept of Baelor, before the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">eyes of gods and men.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">. . . <i>wed the king</i>. . . The words made her breath come faster, yet still Sansa </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="668" height="22" font="2">hesitated. “Perhaps. . . if I might see my father, talk to him about. . .” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="303" height="22" font="2">“Treason?” Lord Varys hinted. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You disappoint me, Sansa,” the queen said, with eyes gone hard as stones. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“We’ve told you of your father’s crimes. If you are truly as loyal as you say, why </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="291" height="22" font="2">should you want to see him?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I. . . I only meant. . .” Sansa felt her eyes grow wet. “He’s not. . . please, he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">hasn’t been. . . hurt, or. . . or. . .” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="508" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard has not been harmed,” the queen said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="347" height="22" font="2">“But. . . what’s to become of him?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“That is a matter for the  king to decide,” Grand Maester Pycelle announced </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="131" height="22" font="2">ponderously. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The <i>king!</i> Sansa blinked back her tears. Joffrey was the king now, she thought. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Her gallant prince would never hurt her father, no matter what he might have done. </text>
</page>
<page number="441" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">If she went to him and pleaded for mercy, she was certain he’d listen. He  <i>had</i>  to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">listen, he loved her, even the queen said so. Joff would need to punish Father, the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lords would expect it, but perhaps he could send him back to Winterfell, or exile </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him to one of the Free Cities across the narrow sea. It would only have to be for a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">few years. By then she and Joffrey would be married. Once she was queen, she </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="628" height="22" font="2">could persuade Joff to bring Father back and grant him a pardon. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Only. . . if Mother or Robb did anything treasonous, called the banners or </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">refused to swear fealty or  <i>anything</i>,  it would all go wrong. Her Joffrey was good </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and kind, she knew it in her heart, but a king had to be stern with rebels. She had to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="342" height="22" font="2">make them understand, she <i>had</i> to! </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="449" height="22" font="2">“I’ll. . . I’ll write the letters,” Sansa told them. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">With a smile as warm as the sunrise, Cersei Lannister leaned close and kissed </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her gently on the cheek. “I knew you would. Joffrey will be so proud when I tell </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">him what courage and good sense you’ve shown here today.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">In the end, she wrote four letters. To her mother, the Lady Catelyn Stark, and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to her brothers at Winterfell, and to her aunt and her grandfather as well, Lady Lysa </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Arryn of the Eyrie, and Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun. By the time she had done, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her fingers were cramped and stiff and stained with ink. Varys had her father’s seal. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She warmed the pale white beeswax over a candle, poured it carefully, and watched </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">as the eunuch stamped each letter with the direwolf of House Stark. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jeyne Poole and all her things were gone when Ser Mandon Moore returned </text>

<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gratefully. Yet somehow it seemed colder with Jeyne gone, even after she’d built a </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fire. She pulled a chair close to the hearth, took down one of her favorite books, and </text>

<text top="483" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Ghost’s jaws. His right hand was floating in a jar of vinegar back in Maester </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">Aemon’s tower. His left hand, still at the end of his arm, was as black as his cloak. </text>
<text top="538" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Gods have mercy,” the Old Bear muttered. He swung down from his garron, </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">handing his reins to Jon. The morning was unnaturally warm; beads of sweat dotted </text>

<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Jon led her off a few paces, fighting to keep her from bolting. The horses did not </text>

<text top="704" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The dogs liked it least of all. Ghost had led the party here; the pack of hounds </text>

<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dream had gone further than before. In the dark he’d heard the scrape of stone on </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly huddled beneath the trees, half-hidden behind the horses. His </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">round fat face was the color of curdled milk. So far he had not lurched off to the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">woods to retch, but he had not so much as glanced at the dead men either. “I can’t </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">look,” he whispered miserably. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You have to look,” Jon told him, keeping his voice low so the others would </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not hear. “Maester Aemon sent you to be his eyes, didn’t he? What good are eyes if </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">they’re shut?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="372" height="22" font="2">“Yes, but. . . I’m such a coward, Jon.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon put a hand on Sam’s shoulder. “We have a dozen rangers with us, and the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dogs, even Ghost. No one will hurt you, Sam. Go ahead and look. The first look is </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">the hardest.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Sam gave a tremulous nod, working up his courage with a visible effort. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Slowly he swiveled his head. His eyes widened,  but Jon held his arm so he could </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="2">not turn away. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ser Jaremy,” the Old Bear asked gruffly, “Ben Stark had six men with him </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="508" height="22" font="2">when he rode from the Wall. Where are the others?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="480" height="22" font="2">Ser Jaremy shook his head. “Would that I knew.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Plainly Mormont was not pleased with that answer. “Two of our brothers </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">butchered almost within sight of the Wall, yet your rangers heard nothing, saw </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">nothing. Is this what the Night’s Watch has fallen to? Do we still sweep these </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">woods?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="219" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord, but—” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="294" height="22" font="2">“Do we still mount watches?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="157" height="22" font="2">“We do, but—” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“This man wears a hunting horn.” Mormont pointed at Othor. “Must I suppose </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that he died without sounding it? Or have your rangers all gone deaf as well as </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">blind?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Jaremy bristled, his face taut with anger. “No horn was blown, my lord, or </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">my  rangers would have heard it. I do not have sufficient men to mount as many </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">patrols as I should like. . . and since Benjen was lost, we have stayed closer to the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">Wall than we were wont to do before, by your own command.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear grunted. “Yes. Well. Be that as it may.” He made an impatient </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">gesture. “Tell me how they died.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Squatting beside the dead man he had named Jafer Flowers, Ser Jaremy </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">grasped his head by the scalp. The hair came out between his fingers, brittle as </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">straw. The knight cursed and shoved at the face with the heel of his hand. A great </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gash in the side of the corpse’s neck opened like a mouth, crusted with dried blood. </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Only a few ropes of pale tendon still attached the head to the neck. “This was done </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">with an axe.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Aye,” muttered Dywen, the old forester. “Belike the axe that Othor carried, </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jon could feel his breakfast churning in his belly, but he pressed his lips </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">together and made himself look at the second body. Othor had been a big ugly man, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and he made a big ugly corpse. No axe was in evidence. Jon remembered Othor; he </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had been the one bellowing the bawdy song as the rangers rode out. His singing </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">days were done. His flesh was blanched white as milk, everywhere but his hands. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">His hands were black like Jafer’s. Blossoms of hard cracked blood decorated the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mortal wounds that covered him like a rash, breast and groin and throat. Yet his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="631" height="22" font="2">eyes were still open. They stared up at the sky, blue as sapphires. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="480" height="22" font="2">Ser Jaremy stood. “The wildlings have axes too.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Mormont rounded on him. “So you believe this is Mance Rayder’s work? This </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="189" height="22" font="2">close to the Wall?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="215" height="22" font="2">“Who else, my lord?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon could have told him. He knew, they all knew, yet no man of them would </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">say the words. <i>The Others are only a story, a tale to make children shiver. If they </i></text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>ever lived at all, they are gone eight thousand years</i>.  Even the thought made him </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">feel foolish; he was a man grown now, a black brother of the Night’s Watch, not the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">boy who’d once sat at Old Nan’s feet with Bran and Robb and Arya. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Yet Lord Commander Mormont gave a snort. “If Ben Stark had come under </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wildling attack a half day’s ride from Castle Black, he would have returned for </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">more men, chased the killers through all seven hells and brought me back their </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">heads.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="494" height="22" font="2">“Unless he was slain as well,” Ser Jaremy insisted. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The words hurt, even now. It had been so long, it seemed folly to cling to the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="753" height="22" font="2">hope that Ben Stark was still alive, but Jon Snow was nothing if not stubborn. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It has been close on half a year since Benjen left us, my lord,” Ser Jaremy </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">went on. “The forest is vast. The wildlings might have fallen on him anywhere. I’d </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wager these two were the last survivors of his party, on their way back to us. . . but </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the enemy caught them before they could reach the safety of the Wall. The corpses </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="670" height="22" font="2">are still fresh, these men cannot have been dead more than a day. . ..” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="311" height="22" font="2">“<i>No</i>,” Samwell Tarly squeaked. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon was startled. Sam’s nervous, high-pitched voice was the last he would </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have expected to hear. The fat boy was frightened of the officers, and Ser Jaremy </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">was not known for his patience. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="540" height="22" font="2">“I did not ask for your views, boy,” Rykker said coldly. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="329" height="22" font="2">“Let him speak, ser,” Jon blurted. </text>
</page>
<page number="445" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Mormont’s eyes flicked from Sam to Jon and back again. “If the lad has </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">something to say, I’ll hear him out. Come closer, boy. We can’t see you behind </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">those horses.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sam edged past Jon and the garrons, sweating profusely. “My lord, it. . . it </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="411" height="22" font="2">can’t be a day or. . . look. . . the blood. . .” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="579" height="22" font="2">“Yes?” Mormont growled impatiently. “Blood, what of it?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He soils his smallclothes at the sight of it,” Chett shouted out, and the rangers </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="88" height="22" font="2">laughed. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">Sam mopped at the sweat on his brow. “You. . . you can see where </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Ghost. . . Jon’s direwolf. . . you can see where he tore off that man’s hand, and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yet. . . the stump hasn’t bled, look. . .”  He waved a hand. “My father. . . L-lord </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Randyll, he, he made me watch him dress animals sometimes, when. . . after. . .” </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Sam shook his head from side to side, his chins quivering. Now that he had looked </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">at the bodies, he could not seem to look away. “A fresh kill. . . the blood would still </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">flow, my lords. Later. . . later it would be clotted, like a. . . a jelly, thick </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and. . . and. . .” He looked as though he was going to be sick. “This man. . . look at </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="443" height="22" font="2">the wrist, it’s all. . . <i>crusty</i>. . . dry. . . like . . .” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon saw at once what Sam meant. He could see the torn veins in the dead </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man’s wrist, iron worms in the pale flesh. His blood was a black dust. Yet Jaremy </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Rykker was unconvinced. “If they’d been dead much longer than a day, they’d be </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">ripe by now, boy. They don’t even smell.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dywen, the gnarled old forester who liked to boast that he could smell snow </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">coming on, sidled closer to the corpses and took a whiff. “Well, they’re no pansy </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">flowers, but. . . m’lord has the truth of it. There’s no corpse stink.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“They. . . they aren’t rotting.” Sam pointed, his fat finger shaking only a little. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Look,  there’s. . . there’s no maggots or. . . or. . . worms or anything. . . they’ve </text>

<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Untouched,” Jon said softly. “And Ghost is different. The dogs and the </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The rangers exchanged glances; they could see it was true, every man of them. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Mormont frowned, glancing from the corpses to the dogs. “Chett, bring the hounds </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="80" height="22" font="2">closer.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Chett tried, cursing, yanking on the  leashes, giving one animal a lick of his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">boot. Most of the dogs just whimpered and planted their feet. He tried dragging one. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">The bitch resisted, growling and squirming as if to escape her collar. Finally she </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lunged at him. Chett dropped the leash and stumbled backward. The dog leapt over </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">himself swallow, took a deep breath. “With those  <i>wounds</i> . . . terrible </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="585" height="22" font="2">wounds. . . there should be blood all over. Shouldn’t there?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dywen sucked at his wooden teeth. “Might be they didn’t die here. Might be </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">someone brought ’em and left ’em for us. A warning, as like.” The old forester </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">peered down suspiciously. “And might be I’m a fool, but I don’t know that Othor </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="298" height="22" font="2">never had no blue eyes afore.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Jaremy looked startled. “Neither did Flowers,” he blurted, turning to stare </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="163" height="22" font="2">at the dead man. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A silence fell over the wood. For a moment all they heard was Sam’s heavy </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">breathing and the wet sound of Dywen sucking on his teeth. Jon squatted beside </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">Ghost. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“<i>Burn them</i>,” someone whispered. One of the rangers; Jon could not have said </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">who. “Yes, burn them,” a second voice urged. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear gave a stubborn shake of his head. “Not yet. I want Maester </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="653" height="22" font="2">Aemon to have a look at them. We’ll bring them back to the Wall.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Some commands are more easily given than obeyed. They wrapped the dead </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">men in cloaks, but when Hake and Dywen tried to tie one onto a horse, the animal </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">went mad, screaming and rearing, lashing out with its hooves, even biting at Ketter </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when he ran to help. The rangers had no better luck with the other garrons; not even </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the most placid wanted any part of these burdens. In the end they were forced to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hack off branches and fashion crude slings to carry the corpses back on foot. It was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="458" height="22" font="2">well past midday by the time they started back. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I will have these woods searched,” Mormont commanded Ser Jaremy as they </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">set out. “Every tree, every rock, every bush, and every foot of muddy ground within </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ten leagues of here. Use all the men you have, and if you do not have enough, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">borrow hunters and foresters from the stewards. If Ben and the others are out here, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dead or alive, I will have them found. And if there is anyone else in these woods, I </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">will know of it. You are to track them and take them, alive if possible. Is that </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">understood?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="494" height="22" font="2">“It is, my lord,” Ser Jaremy said. “It will be done.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">After that, Mormont rode in silence, brooding. Jon followed close behind him; </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">as the Lord Commander’s steward, that was his place. The day was grey, damp, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">overcast, the sort of day that made you wish for rain. No wind stirred the wood; the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">air hung humid and heavy, and Jon’s clothes clung to his skin. It was warm. Too </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">warm. The Wall was weeping copiously, had been weeping for days, and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">sometimes Jon even imagined it was shrinking. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The old men called this weather  <i>spirit summer</i>,  and said it meant the season </text>
</page>
<page number="447" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was giving up its ghosts at last. After this the cold would come, they warned, and a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">long summer always meant a long winter. This summer had lasted ten years. Jon </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="384" height="22" font="2">had been a babe in arms when it began. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ghost ran with them for a time and then vanished among the trees. Without </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the direwolf, Jon felt almost naked. He found himself glancing at every shadow </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with unease. Unbidden, he thought back on the tales that Old Nan used to tell them, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">when he was a boy at Winterfell. He could almost hear her voice again, and the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>click-click-click</i> of her needles. <i>In that darkness, the Others came riding</i>, she used </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to say, dropping her voice lower and lower.  <i>Cold and dead they were, and they </i></text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every living creature with hot </i></text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>blood in its veins. Holdfasts and cities and kingdoms of men all fell before them, as </i></text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>they moved south on pale dead horses, leading hosts of the slain. They fed their </i></text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="479" height="22" font="4"><i>dead servants on the flesh of human children</i> . . .  </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When he caught his first glimpse of the Wall looming above the tops of an </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">ancient gnarled oak, Jon was vastly relieved. Mormont reined up suddenly and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="523" height="22" font="2">turned in his saddle. “Tarly,” he barked, “come here.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon saw the start of fright on Sam’s face as he lumbered up on his mare; </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">doubtless he thought he was in trouble. “You’re fat but you’re not stupid, boy,” the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">Old Bear said gruffly. “You did well back there. And you, Snow.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sam blushed a vivid crimson and tripped over his own tongue as he tried to </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="404" height="22" font="2">stammer out a courtesy. Jon had to smile. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When they  emerged from under the trees, Mormont spurred his tough little </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">garron to a trot. Ghost came streaking out from the woods to meet them, licking his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chops, his muzzle red from prey. High above, the men on the Wall saw the column </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">approaching. Jon heard the deep, throaty call of the watchman’s great horn, calling </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">out across the miles; a single long blast that shuddered through the trees and echoed </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="109" height="22" font="2">off the ice. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="652" height="22" font="4"><i>UUUUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooo</i>. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The sound faded slowly to silence. One blast meant rangers returning, and Jon </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thought, <i>I was a ranger for one day, at least. Whatever may come, they cannot take </i></text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="4"><i>that away from me</i>. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bowen Marsh was waiting at the first gate as they led their garrons through </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the icy tunnel. The Lord Steward was red-faced and agitated. “My lord,” he blurted </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">at Mormont as he swung open the iron bars, “there’s been a bird, you must come at </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">once.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">“What is it, man?” Mormont said gruffly. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Curiously, Marsh glanced at Jon before he answered. “Maester Aemon has the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">letter. He’s waiting in your solar.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Very well. Jon, see to my horse, and tell Ser Jaremy to put the dead men in a </text>
</page>
<page number="448" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="785" height="22" font="2">storeroom until the maester is ready for them.” Mormont strode away grumbling. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As they led their horses back to the stable, Jon was uncomfortably aware that </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">people were watching him. Ser Alliser Thorne was drilling his boys in the yard, but </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he broke off to stare at Jon, a faint half smile on his lips. One-armed Donal Noye </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="753" height="22" font="2">stood in the door of the armory. “The gods be with you, Snow,” he called out. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="568" height="22" font="4"><i>Something’s wrong</i>, Jon thought. <i>Something’s very wrong</i>. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The dead men were carried to one of the storerooms along the base of the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Wall, a dark cold cell chiseled from the ice and used to keep meat and grain and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">sometimes even beer. Jon saw that Mormont’s horse was fed and watered and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">groomed before he took care of his own. Afterward he sought out his friends. Grenn </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">and Toad were on watch, but he found Pyp in the common hall. “What’s </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">happened?” he asked. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="413" height="22" font="2">Pyp lowered his voice. “The king’s dead.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon was stunned. Robert Baratheon had looked old and fat when he visited </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, yet he’d seemed hale enough, and there’d been no talk of illness. “How </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="162" height="22" font="2">can you know?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“One of the guards overheard Clydas reading the letter to Maester Aemon.” </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="727" height="22" font="2">Pyp leaned close. “Jon, I’m sorry. He was your father’s friend, wasn’t he?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“They were as close as brothers, once.” Jon wondered if Joffrey would keep </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his father as the King’s Hand. It did not seem likely. That might mean Lord Eddard </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">would return to Winterfell, and his sisters as well. He might even be allowed to visit </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them, with Lord Mormont’s permission. It would be good to see Arya’s grin again </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and to talk with his father. <i>I will ask him about my mother</i>, he resolved. <i>I am a man </i></text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>now, it is past time he told me. Even if she was a whore, I don’t care, I want to </i></text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="4"><i>know</i>. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="601" height="22" font="2">“I heard Hake say the dead men were your uncle’s,” Pyp said. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Jon replied. “Two of the six he took with him. They’d been dead a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="397" height="22" font="2">long time, only. . . the bodies are queer.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">“Queer?” Pyp was all curiosity. “How queer?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Sam will tell you.” Jon did not want to talk of it. “I should see if the Old Bear </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">has need of me.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He walked to the Lord Commander’s Tower alone, with a curious sense of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">apprehension. The brothers on guard eyed him solemnly as he approached. “The </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">Old Bear’s in his solar,” one of them announced. “He was asking for you.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon nodded. He should have come straight from the stable. He climbed the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="813" height="22" font="2">tower steps briskly. <i>He wants wine or a fire in his hearth, that’s all</i>, he told himself. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When he entered the solar, Mormont’s raven screamed at him. “<i>Corn!</i>” the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="349" height="22" font="2">bird shrieked. “<i>Corn! Corn! Corn!</i>” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Don’t you believe it, I just fed him,” the Old Bear growled. He was seated by </text>
</page>
<page number="449" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">the window, reading a letter. “Bring me a cup of wine, and pour one for yourself.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="230" height="22" font="2">“For myself, my lord?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mormont lifted his eyes from the letter to stare at Jon. There was pity in that </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">look; he could taste it. “You heard me.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon poured with exaggerated care, vaguely aware that he was drawing out the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">act. When the cups were filled, he would have no choice but to face whatever was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in that letter. Yet all too soon, they were filled. “Sit, boy,” Mormont commanded </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">him. “Drink.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">Jon remained standing. “It’s my father, isn’t it?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear tapped the letter with a finger. “Your father and the king,” he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">rumbled. “I won’t lie to you, it’s grievous news. I never thought to see another king, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not at my age, with Robert half my years and strong as a bull.” He took a gulp of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wine. “They say the king loved to hunt. The things we love destroy us every time, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lad. Remember that. My son loved that young wife of his. Vain woman. If not for </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="556" height="22" font="2">her, he would never have thought to sell those poachers.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon could scarcely follow what he was saying. “My lord, I don’t understand. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">What’s happened to my father?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I told you to sit,” Mormont grumbled. “<i>Sit</i>,” the raven screamed. “And have </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">a drink, damn you. That’s a command, Snow.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="303" height="22" font="2">Jon sat, and took a sip of wine. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard has been imprisoned. He is charged with treason. It is said he </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="657" height="22" font="2">plotted with Robert’s brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” Jon said at once. “That couldn’t be. My father would never betray the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">king!” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="706" height="22" font="2">“Be that as it may,” said Mormont. “It is not for me to say. Nor for you.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“But it’s a <i>lie</i>,” Jon insisted. How could they think his father was a traitor, had </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="801" height="22" font="2">they all gone mad? Lord Eddard Stark would never dishonor himself. . . would he? </text>

<text top="832" left="54" width="771" height="22" font="4"><i>honor in that? And your mother, what of her? He will not even speak her name</i>. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="549" height="22" font="2">“My lord, what will happen to him? Will they kill him?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“As to that, I cannot say, lad. I mean to send a letter. I knew some of the </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon knew that other men accused of treason had been allowed to redeem their </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And would Joffrey allow it? He remembered the prince at Winterfell, the way </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he’d  mocked Robb and Ser Rodrik in the yard. Jon himself he had scarcely even </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">noticed; bastards were beneath even his contempt. “My lord, will the king listen to </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">you?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear shrugged. “A boy king. . . I imagine he’ll listen to his mother. A </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pity the dwarf isn’t with them. He’s the lad’s uncle, and he saw our need when he </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="676" height="22" font="2">visited us. It was a bad thing, your lady mother taking him captive—” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Lady Stark is not my mother,” Jon reminded him sharply. Tyrion Lannister </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had been a friend to him. If Lord Eddard was killed, she would be as much to blame </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as the queen. “My lord, what of my sisters? Arya and Sansa, they were with my </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">father, do you know—” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Pycelle makes no mention of them, but doubtless they’ll be treated gently. I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">will ask about them when I write.” Mormont shook his head. “This could not have </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">happened at a worse time. If ever the realm needed a strong king. . . there are dark </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">days and cold nights ahead, I feel it in my bones. . .”  He gave Jon a long shrewd </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="638" height="22" font="2">look. “I hope you are not thinking of doing anything stupid, boy.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>He’s my father</i>, Jon wanted to say, but he knew that Mormont would not want </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="698" height="22" font="2">to hear it. His throat was dry. He made himself take another sip of wine. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your duty is here now,” the Lord Commander reminded him. “Your old life </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ended when you took the black.” His bird made a raucous echo. “<i>Black</i>.” Mormont </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">took no notice. “Whatever they do in King’s Landing is none of our concern.” </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">When Jon did not answer, the old man finished his wine and said, “You’re free to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">go. I’ll have no further need of you today. On the morrow you can help me write </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="114" height="22" font="2">that letter.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon did not remember standing or leaving the solar. The next he knew, he was </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">descending the tower steps, thinking,  <i>This is my father, my sisters, how can it be </i></text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="4"><i>none of my concern? </i></text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Outside, one of the guards looked at him and said, “Be strong, boy. The gods </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">are cruel.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>They know</i>, Jon realized. “My father is no traitor,” he said hoarsely. Even the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">words stuck in his throat, as if to choke him. The wind was rising, and it seemed </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">colder in the yard than it had when he’d gone in. Spirit summer was drawing to an </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="47" height="22" font="2">end. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The rest of the afternoon passed as if in a dream. Jon could not have said </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">where he walked, what he did, who he spoke with. Ghost was with him, he knew </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that much. The silent presence of the direwolf gave him comfort. <i>The girls do not </i></text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>even have that much</i>, he thought. <i>Their wolves might have kept them safe, but Lady </i></text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="440" height="22" font="4"><i>is dead and Nymeria’s lost, they’re all alone</i>. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A north wind had begun to blow by the time the sun went down. Jon could </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hear it skirling against the Wall and over the icy battlements as he went to the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">common hall for the evening meal. Hobb had cooked up a venison stew, thick with </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">barley, onions, and carrots. When he spooned an extra portion onto Jon’s plate and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">gave him the crusty heel of the bread, he knew what it meant. <i>He knows</i>. He looked </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="746" height="22" font="2">around the hall, saw heads turn quickly, eyes politely averted. <i>They all know</i>. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">His friends rallied to him. “We asked the septon to light a candle for your </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father,” Matthar told him. “It’s a lie, we all know it’s a lie, even <i>Grenn</i> knows it’s a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">lie,” Pyp chimed in. Grenn nodded, and Sam clasped Jon’s hand, “You’re my </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother now, so he’s my father too,” the fat boy said. “If you want to go out to the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="527" height="22" font="2">weirwoods and pray to the old gods, I’ll go with you.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The weirwoods were beyond the Wall, yet he knew Sam meant what he said. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="754" height="22" font="4"><i>They</i> are <i>my brothers</i>, he thought. <i>As much as Robb and Bran and Rickon</i> . . .  </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">And then he heard the laughter, sharp and cruel as a whip, and the voice of Ser </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Alliser Thorne. “Not only a bastard, but a <i>traitor’s</i> bastard,” he was telling the men </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="122" height="22" font="2">around him. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">In the blink of an eye, Jon had vaulted onto the table, dagger in his hand. Pyp </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">made a grab for him, but he wrenched his leg away, and then he was sprinting down </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">the table and kicking the bowl from Ser Alliser’s hand. Stew went flying </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">everywhere, spattering the brothers. Thorne recoiled. People were shouting, but Jon </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Snow did not hear them. He lunged at Ser Alliser’s face with the dagger, slashing at </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">those cold onyx eyes, but Sam threw himself between them and before Jon could </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">get around him, Pyp was on his back clinging like a monkey, and Grenn was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="639" height="22" font="2">grabbing his arm while Toad wrenched the knife from his fingers. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Later, much later, after they had marched him back to his sleeping cell, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Mormont  came down to see him, raven on his shoulder. “I told you not to do </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">anything stupid, boy,” the Old Bear said. “<i>Boy</i>,” the bird chorused. Mormont shook </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">his head, disgusted. “And to think I had high hopes for you.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">They took his knife and his sword and told him he was not to leave his cell </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">until the high officers met to decide what was to be done with him. And then they </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">placed a guard outside his door to make certain he obeyed. His friends were not </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">allowed to see him, but the Old Bear did relent and permit him Ghost, so he was not </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">utterly alone. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My father is no traitor,” he told the direwolf when the rest had gone. Ghost </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked at him in silence. Jon slumped against the wall, hands around his knees, and </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stared at the candle on the table beside his narrow bed. The flame flickered and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">swayed, the shadows moved around him, the room seemed to grow darker and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">colder. <i>I will not sleep tonight</i>, Jon thought. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Yet he must have dozed. When he woke, his legs were stiff and cramped and </text>
</page>
<page number="452" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the candle had long since burned out. Ghost stood on his hind legs, scrabbling at the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">door. Jon was startled to see how tall he’d grown. “Ghost, what is it?” he called </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">softly. The direwolf turned his head and looked down at him, baring his fangs in a </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">silent snarl.  <i>Has he gone mad?</i>  Jon wondered. “It’s me, Ghost,” he murmured, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">trying not to sound afraid. Yet he was trembling, violently. When had it gotten so </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="58" height="22" font="2">cold? </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ghost backed away from the door. There were deep gouges where he’d raked </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the wood. Jon watched him with mounting disquiet. “There’s someone out there, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">isn’t there?” he whispered. Crouching, the direwolf crept backward, white fur rising </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on the back of his neck. <i>The guard</i>, he thought, <i>they left a man to guard my door, </i></text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="4"><i>Ghost smells him through the door, that’s all it is</i>. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Slowly, Jon pushed himself to his feet. He was shivering uncontrollably, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wishing he still had a sword. Three quick steps brought him to the door. He grabbed </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="775" height="22" font="2">the handle and pulled it inward. The <i>creak</i> of the hinges almost made him jump. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His guard was sprawled bonelessly across the narrow steps, looking up at him. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Looking  <i>up</i>  at him, even though he was lying on his stomach. His head had been </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">twisted completely around. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="4"><i>It can’t be</i>, Jon told himself.  <i>This is the Lord Commander’s Tower, it’s </i></text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="807" height="22" font="4"><i>guarded day and night, this couldn’t happen, it’s a dream, I’m having a nightmare</i>. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ghost slid past him, out the door. The wolf started up the steps, stopped, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">looked back at Jon. That was when he heard it; the soft scrape of a boot on stone, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">the sound of a latch turning. The sounds came from above. From the Lord </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="246" height="22" font="2">Commander’s chambers. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="464" height="22" font="2">A nightmare this might be, yet it was no dream. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The guard’s sword was in its sheath. Jon knelt and worked it free. The heft of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">steel in his fist made him bolder. He moved up the steps, Ghost padding silently </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">before him. Shadows lurked in every turn of the stair. Jon crept up warily, probing </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="507" height="22" font="2">any suspicious darkness with the point of his sword. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Suddenly he heard the shriek of Mormont’s raven. “<i>Corn</i>,” the bird was </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">screaming. “<i>Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn</i>.” Ghost bounded ahead, and Jon </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">came scrambling after. The door to Mormont’s solar was wide open. The direwolf </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">plunged through. Jon stopped in the doorway, blade in hand, giving his eyes a </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">moment to adjust. Heavy drapes had been pulled across the windows, and the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">darkness was black as ink. “<i>Who’s there?</i>” he called out. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Then he saw it, a shadow in the shadows, sliding toward the inner door that </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="829" height="22" font="2">led to Mormont’s sleeping cell, a man-shape all in black, cloaked and </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="742" height="22" font="2">hooded. . . but beneath the hood, its eyes shone with an icy blue radiance. . .  </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ghost leapt. Man and wolf went down together with neither scream nor snarl, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rolling, smashing into a chair, knocking over a table laden with papers. Mormont’s </text>

<page number="453" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raven was flapping overhead, screaming, “<i>Corn, corn, corn, corn</i>.” Jon felt as blind </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as Maester Aemon. Keeping the wall to his back, he slid toward the window and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ripped down the curtain. Moonlight flooded the solar. He glimpsed black hands </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">buried in white fur, swollen dark fingers tightening around his direwolf’s throat. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Ghost was twisting and snapping, legs flailing in the air, but he could not break </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">free. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon had no time to be afraid. He threw himself forward, shouting, bringing </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down the longsword with all his weight behind it. Steel sheared through sleeve and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">skin and bone, yet the sound was <i>wrong</i> somehow. The smell that engulfed him was </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">so queer and cold he almost gagged. He saw arm and hand on the floor, black </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fingers wriggling in a pool of moonlight. Ghost wrenched free of the other hand and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">crept away, red tongue lolling from his mouth. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The hooded man lifted his pale moon face, and Jon slashed at it without </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hesitation. The sword laid the intruder open to the bone, taking off half his nose and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">opening a gash cheek to cheek under those eyes, eyes, eyes like blue stars burning. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Jon knew that face. <i>Othor</i>, he thought, reeling back. <i>Gods, he’s dead, he’s dead, I </i></text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="4"><i>saw him dead</i>. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He felt something scrabble at his ankle. Black fingers clawed at his calf. The </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">arm was crawling up his leg, ripping at wool and flesh. Shouting with revulsion, Jon </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pried the fingers off his leg with the point of his sword and flipped the thing away. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="427" height="22" font="2">It lay writhing, fingers opening and closing. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The corpse lurched forward. There was no blood. One-armed, face cut near in </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">half, it seemed to feel nothing. Jon held the longsword before him. “Stay away!” he </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commanded, his voice gone shrill. “<i>Corn</i>,” screamed the raven, “<i>corn, corn</i>.” The </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">severed arm was wriggling  out of its torn sleeve, a pale snake with a black five-</text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fingered head. Ghost pounced and got it between his teeth. Finger bones crunched. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="627" height="22" font="2">Jon hacked at the corpse’s neck, felt the steel bite deep and hard. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="559" height="22" font="2">Dead Othor slammed into him, knocking him off his feet. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Jon’s breath went out of him as the fallen table caught him between his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shoulder blades. The sword, where was the sword? He’d lost the damned  <i>sword</i>! </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">When he opened his mouth to scream, the wight jammed its black corpse fingers </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">into Jon’s mouth. Gagging, he tried to shove it off, but the dead man was too heavy. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Its hand forced itself farther down his throat, icy cold, choking him. Its face was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">against his own, filling the world. Frost covered its eyes, sparkling blue. Jon raked </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cold flesh with his nails and kicked at the thing’s legs. He tried to bite, tried to </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">punch, tried to breathe. . .  </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">And suddenly the corpse’s weight was gone, its fingers ripped from his throat. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="553" height="22" font="2">It was all Jon could do to roll over, retching and shaking. </text>

<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">doorway with an oil lamp in hand. Gnawed and fingerless, the arm thrashed on the </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon tried to shout, but his voice was gone. Staggering to his feet, he kicked the </text>

<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">into the puddled cloth with both hands. Metal crunched, glass shattered, oil spewed, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the hangings went up in a great <i>whoosh</i> of flame. The heat of it on his face was </text>

<text top="538" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">but they did not look like Starks to Bran. They were big men, and fierce, faces </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">covered with thick beards, hair worn loose past the shoulders. Their cloaks were </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="486" height="22" font="2">made of skins, the pelts of bear and seal and wolf. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They were the last, he knew. The other lords were already here, with their </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">hosts. Bran yearned to ride out among them, to see the winter houses full to </text>

<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and torn by wheel and hoof. But Robb had forbidden him to leave the castle. “We </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="609" height="22" font="2">have no men to spare to guard you,” his brother had explained. </text>
<text top="759" left="108" width="326" height="22" font="2">“I’ll take Summer,” Bran argued. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Don’t act the boy with me, Bran,” Robb said. “You know better than that. </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Only two days ago one of Lord Bolton’s men knifed one of Lord Cerwyn’s at the </text>

<text top="925" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">It was because of what had happened in the wolfswood, he knew. The </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">memory still gave him bad dreams. He had been as helpless as a baby, no more able </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">over the walls by himself. In those days he could run down stairs, get on and off his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pony by himself, and wield a wooden sword good enough to knock Prince Tommen </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">in the dirt. Now he could only watch, peering out through Maester Luwin’s lens </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tube. The maester had taught him all the banners: the mailed fist of the Glovers, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">silver on scarlet; Lady Mormont’s black bear; the hideous flayed man that went </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">before Roose Bolton of the Dreadfort; a bull moose for the Hornwoods; a battle-axe </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">for the Cerwyns; three sentinel trees for the Tallharts; and the fearsome sigil of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="483" height="22" font="2">House Umber, a roaring giant in shattered chains. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And soon enough he learned the faces too, when the lords and their sons and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">knights retainer came to Winterfell to feast. Even the Great Hall was not large </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">enough to seat all of them at once, so Robb hosted each of the principal bannermen </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in turn. Bran was always given the place of honor at his brother’s right hand. Some </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">of the lords bannermen gave him queer hard stares as he sat there, as if they </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">wondered by what right a green boy should be placed above them, and him a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">cripple too. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“How many is it now?” Bran asked Maester Luwin as Lord Karstark and his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">sons rode through the gates in the outer wall. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="592" height="22" font="2">“Twelve thousand men, or near enough as makes no matter.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="221" height="22" font="2">“How many knights?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Few enough,” the maester said with a touch of impatience. “To be a knight, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">you must stand  your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">consecrate your vows. In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Seven. The rest honor the old gods, and name no knights. . . but those lords and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable. A man’s worth </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">is not marked by a <i>ser</i> before his name. As I have told you a hundred times before.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="392" height="22" font="2">“Still,” said Bran, “how many knights?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="775" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin sighed. “Three hundred, perhaps four. . . among three </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">thousand armored lances who are not knights.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Lord Karstark is the last,” Bran said thoughtfully. “Robb will feast him </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">tonight.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="195" height="22" font="2">“No doubt he will.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="375" height="22" font="2">“How long before. . . before they go?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He must march soon, or not at all,” Maester Luwin said. “The winter town is </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">full to bursting, and this army of his will eat the countryside clean if it camps here </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">much longer. Others are waiting to join him all along the kingsroad, barrow knights </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and crannogmen and the Lords Manderly and Flint. The fighting has begun in the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">riverlands, and your brother has many leagues to go.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I know.” Bran felt as miserable as he sounded. He handed the bronze tube </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">back to the maester, and noticed how thin Luwin’s hair had grown on top. He could </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">see the pink of scalp showing through. It felt queer to look down on him this way, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he’d spent his whole life looking up at him, but when you sat on Hodor’s </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">back you looked down on everyone. “I don’t want to watch anymore. Hodor, take </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">me back to the keep.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="213" height="22" font="2">“Hodor,” said Hodor. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin tucked the tube up his sleeve. “Bran, your lord brother will not </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have time to see you now. He must greet Lord Karstark and his sons and make them </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="109" height="22" font="2">welcome.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I won’t trouble Robb. I want to visit the godswood.” He put his hand on </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">Hodor’s shoulder. “Hodor.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A series of chisel-cut handholds made a ladder in the granite of the tower’s </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">inner wall. Hodor hummed tunelessly as he went down hand under hand, Bran </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bouncing against his back in the wicker seat that Maester Luwin had fashioned for </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him. Luwin had gotten the idea from the baskets the women used to carry firewood </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">on their backs; after that it had been a simple matter of cutting legholes and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">attaching some new straps to spread Bran’s weight more evenly. It was not as good </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as riding Dancer, but there were places Dancer could not go, and this did not shame </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Bran the way it did when Hodor carried him in his arms like a baby. Hodor seemed </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to like it too, though with Hodor it was hard to tell. The only tricky part was doors. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Sometimes Hodor  <i>forgot</i>  that he had Bran on his back, and that  could be painful </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">when he went through a door. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">For near a fortnight there had been so many comings and goings that Robb </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ordered both portcullises kept up and the drawbridge down between them, even in </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the dead of night. A long column of armored lancers was crossing the moat between </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the walls when Bran emerged from the tower; Karstark men, following their lords </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into the castle. They wore black iron halfhelms and black woolen cloaks patterned </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with the white sunburst. Hodor trotted along beside them, smiling to  himself, his </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">boots thudding against the wood of the drawbridge. The riders gave them queer </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">looks as they went by, and once Bran heard someone guffaw. He refused to let it </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">trouble him. “Men will look at you,” Maester Luwin had warned him the first time </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">they had strapped the wicker basket around Hodor’s chest. “They will look, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">they will talk, and some will mock you.”  <i>Let them mock</i>,  Bran thought. No one </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">mocked him in his bedchamber, but he would not live his life in bed. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As they passed beneath the gatehouse portcullis, Bran put two fingers into his </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mouth and whistled. Summer came loping across the yard. Suddenly the Karstark </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lancers were fighting for control, as their horses rolled their eyes and whickered in </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">dismay. One stallion reared, screaming, his rider cursing and hanging on </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">desperately. The scent of the direwolves sent horses into a frenzy of fear if they </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">were not accustomed to it, but they’d quiet soon enough once Summer was gone. </text>
</page>
<page number="458" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="398" height="22" font="2">“The godswood,” Bran reminded Hodor. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Even Winterfell itself was crowded. The yard rang to the sound of sword and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">axe, the rumble of wagons, and the barking of dogs. The armory doors were open, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and Bran glimpsed Mikken at his forge, his hammer ringing as sweat dripped off his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bare chest. Bran had never seen as many strangers in all his years, not even when </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="369" height="22" font="2">King Robert had come to visit Father. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He tried not to flinch as Hodor ducked through a low door. They walked down </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a long dim hallway, Summer padding easily beside them. The wolf glanced up from </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">time to time, eyes smoldering like liquid gold. Bran would have liked to touch him, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">but he was riding too high for his hand to reach. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The godswood was an island of peace in the sea of chaos that Winterfell had </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">become. Hodor made his way through the dense stands of oak and ironwood and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sentinels, to the still pool beside the heart tree. He stopped under the gnarled limbs </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the weirwood, humming. Bran reached up over his head and pulled himself out </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of his seat, drawing the dead weight of his legs up through the holes in the wicker </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">basket. He hung for a moment, dangling, the dark red leaves brushing against his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">face, until Hodor lifted him and lowered him to the smooth stone beside the water. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="752" height="22" font="2">“I want to be by myself for a while,” he said. “You go soak. Go to the pools.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="773" height="22" font="2">“Hodor.” Hodor stomped through the trees and vanished. Across the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">godswood, beneath the windows of the Guest House, an underground hot spring fed </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">three small ponds. Steam rose from the water day and night, and the wall that </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">loomed above was thick with moss. Hodor hated cold water, and would fight like a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">treed wildcat when threatened with soap, but he would happily immerse himself in </text>

<text top="722" left="54" width="657" height="22" font="2">bubble rose from the murky green depths to break upon the surface. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Summer lapped at the water and settled down at Bran’s side. He rubbed the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wolf under the jaw, and for a moment boy and beast both felt at peace. Bran had </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">always liked the godswood, even  <i>before</i>,  but of late he found himself drawn to it </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">more and  more. Even the heart tree no longer scared him the way it used to. The </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">deep red eyes carved into the pale trunk still watched him, yet somehow he took </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">comfort from that now. The gods were looking over him, he told himself; the old </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">gods, gods of the Starks and the First Men and the children of the forest, his <i>father’s</i> </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gods. He felt safe in their sight, and the deep silence of the trees helped him think. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Bran had been thinking a lot since his fall; thinking, and dreaming, and talking with </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">the gods. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Please make it so Robb won’t go away,” he prayed softly. He moved his </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hand through the cold water, sending ripples across the pool. “Please make him </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stay. Or if he has to go, bring him home safe, with Mother and Father and the girls. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="472" height="22" font="2">And make it. . . make it so Rickon understands.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His baby brother had been wild as a winter storm since he learned Robb was </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">riding off to war, weeping and angry by turns. He’d refused to eat, cried and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">screamed for most of a night, even punched Old Nan when she tried to sing him to </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sleep, and the next day he’d vanished. Robb had set half the castle searching for </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him, and when at last they’d found him down in the crypts, Rickon had slashed at </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">them with a rusted iron sword he’d snatched from a dead king’s hand, and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Shaggydog had come slavering out of the darkness like a green-eyed demon. The </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wolf was near as wild as Rickon; he’d bitten Gage on the arm and torn a chunk of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">flesh from Mikken’s thigh. It had taken Robb himself and Grey Wind to bring him </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to bay. Farlen had the black wolf chained up in the kennels now, and Rickon cried </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">all the more for being without him. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin counseled Robb to remain at Winterfell, and Bran pleaded </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with him too, for his own sake as much as Rickon’s, but his brother only shook his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="553" height="22" font="2">head stubbornly and said, “I don’t want to go. I <i>have</i> to.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was only half a lie. Someone had to go, to hold the Neck and help the Tullys </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">against the Lannisters, Bran could understand that, but it did not <i>have</i> to be Robb. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">His brother might have given the command to Hal Mollen or Theon Greyjoy, or to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">one of his lords bannermen. Maester Luwin urged him to do just that, but Robb </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would not hear of it. “My lord father would never have sent men off to die while he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="784" height="22" font="2">huddled like a craven behind the walls of Winterfell,” he said, all Robb the Lord. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb seemed half a stranger to Bran now, transformed, a lord in truth, though </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he had not yet seen his sixteenth name day. Even their father’s bannermen seemed </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to sense it. Many tried to test him, each in his own way. Roose Bolton and Robett </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Glover both demanded the honor of battle command, the first brusquely, the second </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with a smile and a jest. Stout, grey-haired Maege Mormont, dressed in mail like a </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man, told Robb bluntly that he was young enough to be her grandson, and had no </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">business giving her commands . . . but as it happened, she had a granddaughter she </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">would be willing to have him marry. Soft-spoken Lord Cerwyn had actually </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brought his daughter with him, a plump, homely maid of thirty years who sat at her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">father’s left hand and never lifted her eyes from her plate. Jovial Lord Hornwood </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had no daughters, but he did bring gifts, a horse one day, a haunch of venison the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">next, a silver-chased hunting horn the day after, and he asked nothing in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">return. . . nothing but a certain holdfast taken from his  grandfather, and hunting </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rights north of a certain ridge, and leave to dam the White Knife, if it please the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">lord. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb answered each of them with cool courtesy, much as Father might have, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">and somehow he bent them to his will. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And when Lord Umber, who was called the Greatjon by his men and stood as </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tall as Hodor and twice as wide, threatened to take his forces home if he was placed </text>

<page number="460" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">behind the Hornwoods or the Cerwyns in the order of march, Robb told him he was </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">welcome to do so. “And when we are done with the Lannisters,” he promised, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">scratching Grey Wind behind the ear, “we will march back north, root you out of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your keep, and hang you for an oathbreaker.” Cursing, the Greatjon flung a flagon </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of ale into the fire and bellowed that Robb was so green he must piss grass. When </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Hallis Mollen moved to restrain him, he knocked him to the floor, kicked over a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">table, and unsheathed the biggest, ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever seen. All </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">along the benches, his sons and brothers and sworn swords leapt to their feet, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">grabbing for their steel. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Yet Robb only said a quiet word, and in a snarl and the blink of an eye Lord </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Umber was on his back, his sword spinning on the floor three feet away and his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hand dripping blood where Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers. “My lord father </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">taught me that it was death to bare steel against your liege lord,” Robb said, “but </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">doubtless you only meant to cut my meat.” Bran’s bowels went to water as the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Greatjon struggled to rise, sucking at the red stumps of fingers. . . but then, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="784" height="22" font="2">astonishingly, the huge man <i>laughed</i>. “Your meat,” he roared, “is bloody <i>tough</i>.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">And somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb’s right hand, his </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">staunchest champion, loudly telling all and sundry that the boy lord was a Stark </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">after all, and they’d damn well better bend their knees if they didn’t fancy having </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="173" height="22" font="2">them chewed off. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Yet that very night, his brother came to Bran’s bedchamber pale and shaken, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">after the fires had burned low in the Great Hall. “I thought he was going to kill me,” </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robb confessed. “Did you see the way he threw down Hal, like he was no bigger </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">than Rickon? Gods, I was so scared. And the Greatjon’s not the worst of them, only </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the loudest. Lord Roose never says a word, he only looks at me, and all I can think </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of is that room they have in the Dreadfort, where the Boltons hang the skins of their </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">enemies.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“That’s just one of Old Nan’s stories,” Bran said. A note of doubt crept into </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">his voice. “Isn’t it?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I don’t know.” He gave a weary shake of his head. “Lord Cerwyn means to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">take his daughter south with us. To cook for him, he says. Theon is certain I’ll find </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="671" height="22" font="2">the girl in my bedroll one night. I wish. . . I wish Father was here. . .” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That was the one thing they could agree on, Bran and Rickon and Robb the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lord; they all wished Father was here. But Lord Eddard was a thousand leagues </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">away, a captive in some dungeon, a hunted fugitive running for his life, or even </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dead. No one seemed to know for certain; every traveler told a different tale, each </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">more terrifying than the last. The heads of Father’s guardsmen were rotting on the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">walls of the Red Keep, impaled on spikes. King Robert was dead at Father’s hands. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The Baratheons had laid siege to King’s Landing. Lord Eddard had fled south with </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the king’s wicked brother Renly. Arya and Sansa had been murdered by the Hound. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Mother had killed Tyrion the Imp and hung his body from the walls of Riverrun. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin Lannister was marching on the Eyrie,  burning and slaughtering as he </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">went. One wine-sodden taleteller even claimed that Rhaegar Targaryen had returned </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from the dead and was marshaling a vast host of ancient heroes on Dragonstone to </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="264" height="22" font="2">reclaim his father’s throne. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When the raven came, bearing a letter marked with Father’s own seal and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">written in Sansa’s hand, the cruel truth seemed no less incredible. Bran would never </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">forget the look on Robb’s face as he stared at their sister’s words. “She says Father </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">conspired at treason with the king’s brothers,” he read. “King Robert is dead, and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Mother and I are summoned to the Red Keep to swear fealty to Joffrey. She says we </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">must be loyal, and when she marries Joffrey she will plead with him to spare our </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lord father’s life.” His fingers closed into a fist, crushing Sansa’s letter between </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them. “And she says nothing of Arya, <i>nothing</i>, not so much as a word. Damn her! </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">What’s wrong with the girl?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran felt all cold inside. “She lost her wolf,” he said, weakly, remembering </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the day when four of his father’s guardsmen had returned from the south with </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lady’s bones. Summer and Grey Wind and Shaggydog had begun to howl before </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they crossed the drawbridge, in voices drawn and desolate. Beneath the shadow of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the First Keep was an ancient lichyard, its headstones spotted with pale lichen, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">where the old Kings of Winter had laid their faithful servants. It was there they </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">buried Lady, while her brothers stalked between the graves like restless shadows. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">She had gone south, and only her bones had returned. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Their grandfather, old Lord Rickard, had gone as well, with his son Brandon </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">who was Father’s brother, and two hundred of his best men. None had ever </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">returned. And Father had gone south, with Arya and Sansa, and Jory and Hullen and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Fat Tom and the rest, and later Mother and Ser Rodrik had gone, and  <i>they</i>  hadn’t </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">come back either. And now Robb meant to go. Not to King’s Landing and not to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">swear fealty, but to Riverrun, with a sword in his hand. And if their lord father were </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">truly a prisoner, that could mean his death for a certainty. It frightened Bran more </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="179" height="22" font="2">than he could say. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“If Robb has to go, watch over him,” Bran entreated the old gods, as they </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">watched him with the heart tree’s red eyes, “and watch over his men, Hal and Quent </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the rest, and Lord Umber and Lady Mormont and the other lords. And Theon </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">too, I suppose. Watch them and keep them safe, if it please you, gods. Help them </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="590" height="22" font="2">defeat the Lannisters and save Father and bring them home.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A faint wind sighed through the godswood and the red leaves stirred and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">whispered. Summer bared his teeth. “You hear them, boy?” a voice asked. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran lifted his head. Osha stood across the pool, beneath an ancient oak, her </text>
</page>
<page number="462" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face shadowed by leaves. Even in irons, the wildling moved quiet as a cat. Summer </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="547" height="22" font="2">circled the pool, sniffed at her. The tall woman flinched. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Summer, to me,” Bran called. The direwolf took one final sniff, spun, and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bounded back. Bran wrapped his arms around him. “What are <i>you</i> doing here?” He </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had not seen Osha since they’d taken her captive in the wolfswood, though he knew </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">she’d been set to working in the kitchens. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“They are my gods too,” Osha said. “Beyond the Wall, they are the only </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">gods.” Her hair was growing out, brown and shaggy. It made her look more </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">womanly, that and the simple dress of brown roughspun they’d given her when they </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">took her mail and leather. “Gage lets me have my prayers from time to time, when I </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">feel the need, and I let him do as he likes under my skirt, when he feels the need. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">It’s nothing to me. I like the smell of flour on his hands, and he’s gentler than Stiv.” </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="745" height="22" font="2">She gave an awkward bow. “I’ll leave you. There’s pots that want scouring.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No, stay,” Bran commanded her. “Tell me what you meant, about hearing the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">gods.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Osha studied him. “You asked them and they’re answering. Open your ears, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">listen, you’ll hear.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran listened. “It’s only the wind,” he said after a moment, uncertain. “The </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">leaves are rustling.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Who do you think sends the wind, if not the gods?” She seated herself across </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the pool from him, clinking faintly as she moved. Mikken had fixed iron manacles </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to her ankles, with a heavy chain between them; she could walk, so long as she kept </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her strides small, but there was no way for her to run, or climb, or mount a horse. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">“They see you, boy. They hear you talking. That rustling, that’s them talking back.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="241" height="22" font="2">“What are they saying?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They’re sad. Your lord brother will get no help from them, not where he’s </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">going. The old gods have no power in the south. The weirwoods there were all cut </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down, thousands of years ago. How can they watch your brother when they have no </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">eyes?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran had not thought of that. It frightened him. If even the gods could not help </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">his brother, what hope was there? Maybe Osha wasn’t hearing them right. He </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cocked his head and tried to listen again. He thought he could hear the sadness now, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">but nothing more than that. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The rustling grew louder. Bran heard muffled footfalls and a low humming, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="714" height="22" font="2">and Hodor came blundering out of the trees, naked and smiling. “Hodor!” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“He must have heard our voices,” Bran said. “Hodor, you forgot your </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">clothes.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Hodor,” Hodor agreed. He was dripping wet from the neck down, steaming </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the chill air. His body was covered with brown hair, thick as a pelt. Between his </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">legs, his manhood swung long and heavy. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Osha eyed him with a sour smile. “Now there’s a big man,” she said. “He has </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">giant’s blood in him, or I’m the queen.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Maester Luwin says there are no more giants. He says they’re all dead, like </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the children of the forest. All that’s left of them are old bones in the earth that men </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="378" height="22" font="2">turn up with plows from time to time.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Let Maester Luwin ride beyond the Wall,” Osha said. “He’ll find giants then, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">or they’ll find him. My brother killed one. Ten foot tall she was, and stunted at that. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">They’ve been known to grow big as twelve and thirteen feet. Fierce things they are </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">too, all hair and teeth, and the wives have beards like their husbands, so there’s no </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">telling them apart. The women take human men for lovers, and it’s from them the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">half bloods come. It goes harder on the women they catch. The men are so big </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">they’ll rip a maid apart before they get her with child.” She grinned at him. “But </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="430" height="22" font="2">you don’t know what I mean, do you, boy?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Yes I do,” Bran insisted. He understood about mating; he had seen dogs in </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the yard, and watched a stallion mount a mare. But talking about it made  him </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">uncomfortable. He looked at Hodor. “Go back and bring your clothes, Hodor,” he </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="169" height="22" font="2">said. “Go dress.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Hodor.” He walked back the way he had come, ducking under a low-hanging </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">tree limb. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He  <i>was</i>  awfully big, Bran thought as he watched him go. “Are there truly </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">giants beyond the Wall?” he asked Osha, uncertainly. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Giants and worse than giants, Lordling. I tried to tell your brother when he </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">asked his questions, him and your maester and that smiley boy Greyjoy. The cold </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">winds are rising, and men go out from their fires and never come back. . . or if they </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">do, they’re not <i>men</i> no more, but only wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Why do you think I run south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools? Mance </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">thinks he’ll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were no </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">more than rangers, but what does he know? He can call himself King-beyond-the-</text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Wall all he likes, but he’s still just another old black crow who flew down from the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Shadow Tower. He’s never tasted winter. I was <i>born</i> up there, child, like my mother </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and  <i>her</i>  mother before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk. We </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">remember.” Osha stood, her chains rattling together. “I tried to tell your lordling </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">brother. Only yesterday, when I saw him in the yard. ‘M’lord Stark,’ I called to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">him, respectful as you please, but he looked through me, and that sweaty oaf </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Greatjon Umber shoves me out of the path. So be it. I’ll wear my irons and hold my </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="278" height="22" font="2">Bran nodded. “I’ll tell him.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">But that night, when they feasted in the Great Hall, Robb was not with them. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He took his meal in the solar instead, with Lord Rickard and the Greatjon and the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">other lords bannermen, to make the final plans for the long march to come. It was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">left to Bran to fill his place at the head of the table, and act the host to Lord </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Karstark’s sons and honored friends. They were already at their places when Hodor </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">carried Bran into the hall on his back, and knelt beside the high seat. Two of the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">serving men helped lift him from his basket. Bran could feel the  eyes of every </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stranger in the hall. It had grown quiet. “My lords,” Hallis Mollen announced, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">“Brandon Stark, of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I welcome you to our fires,” Bran said stiffly, “and offer you meat and mead </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">in honor of our friendship.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Harrion Karstark, the oldest of Lord Rickard’s sons, bowed, and his brothers </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">after him, yet as they settled back in their places he heard the younger two talking in </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">low voices, over the clatter of wine cups. “. . . sooner die than live like that,” </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">muttered one, his father’s namesake Eddard, and his brother Torrhen said likely the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="666" height="22" font="2">boy was broken inside as well as out, too craven to take his own life. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>Broken</i>, Bran thought bitterly as he clutched his knife. Is that what he was </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">now? Bran the Broken? “I don’t want to be broken,” he whispered fiercely to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="690" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin, who’d been seated to his right. “I want to be a knight.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“There are some who call my order the knights of the mind,” Luwin replied. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“You are a surpassing clever boy when you work at it, Bran. Have you ever thought </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">that you might wear a maester’s chain? There is no limit to what you might learn.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="757" height="22" font="2">“I want to learn <i>magic</i>,” Bran told him. “The crow promised that I would fly.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin sighed. “I can teach you history, healing, herblore. I can teach </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you the speech of ravens, and how to build a castle, and the way a sailor steers his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ship by the stars. I can teach you to measure the days and mark the seasons, and at </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Citadel in Oldtown they can teach you a thousand things more. But, Bran, no </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">man can teach you magic.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The children could,” Bran said. “The children of the forest.” That reminded </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him of the promise he had made to Osha in the godswood, so he told Luwin what </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">she had said. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The maester listened politely. “The wildling woman could give Old Nan </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lessons in telling tales, I think,” he said when Bran was done. “I will talk with her </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">again if you like, but it would be best if you did not trouble your brother with this </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">folly. He has more than enough to concern him without fretting over giants and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dead men in the woods. It’s the Lannisters who hold your lord father, Bran, not the </text>

<page number="465" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">children of the forest.” He put a gentle hand on Bran’s arm. “Think on what I said, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">child.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">And two days later, as a red dawn broke across a windswept sky, Bran found </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">himself in the yard beneath the gatehouse, strapped atop Dancer as he said his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">farewells to his brother. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You are the lord in Winterfell now,” Robb told him. He was mounted on a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shaggy grey stallion, his shield hung from the horse’s side; wood banded with iron, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">white and grey, and on it the snarling face of a direwolf. His brother wore grey </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">chainmail over bleached leathers, sword and dagger at his waist, a fur-trimmed </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cloak across his shoulders. “You must take my place, as I took Father’s, until we </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">come home.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I know,” Bran replied miserably. He had never felt so little or alone or </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">scared. He did not know how to be a lord. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Listen to Maester Luwin’s counsel, and take care of Rickon. Tell him that I’ll </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">be back as soon as the fighting is done.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Rickon had refused to come down. He was up in his chamber, redeyed and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">defiant. “<i>No!</i>” he’d screamed when Bran had asked if he didn’t want to say farewell </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="242" height="22" font="2">to Robb. “<i>NO farewell!</i>” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="577" height="22" font="2">“I told him,” Bran said. “He says no one ever comes back.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He can’t be a baby forever. He’s a Stark, and near four.” Robb sighed. “Well, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">Mother will be home soon. And I’ll bring back Father, I promise.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He wheeled his courser around and trotted away. Grey Wind followed, loping </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beside the warhorse, lean and swift. Hallis Mollen went before them through the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gate, carrying the rippling white banner of House Stark atop a high standard of grey </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">ash. Theon Greyjoy and the Greatjon fell in on either side of Robb, and their </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knights formed up in a double column behind them, steel-tipped lances glinting in </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">the sun. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Uncomfortably, he remembered Osha’s words. <i>He’s marching the wrong way</i>, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he thought. For an instant he wanted to gallop after him and shout a warning, but </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">when Robb vanished beneath the portcullis, the moment was gone. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Beyond the castle walls, a roar of sound went up. The foot soldiers and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">townsfolk were cheering Robb as he rode past, Bran knew; cheering for Lord Stark, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">for the Lord of Winterfell on his great stallion, with his cloak streaming and Grey </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Wind racing beside him. They would never cheer for him that way, he realized with </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a dull ache. He might be the lord in Winterfell while his brother and father were </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gone, but he was still Bran the Broken. He could not even get off his own horse, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">except to fall. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">When the distant cheers had faded to silence and the yard was empty at last, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell seemed deserted and dead. Bran looked around at the faces of those who </text>

<text top="649" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had told him before. “Wooden horses with a hundred legs, that fly across the sea on </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">wings full of wind.” </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo did not want to hear it. “We will speak no more of wooden horses </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and iron chairs.” He dropped the cloth and began to dress. “This day I will go to the </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">grass and hunt, woman wife,” he announced as he shrugged into a painted vest and </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="711" height="22" font="2">buckled on a wide belt with heavy medallions of silver, gold, and bronze. </text>
<text top="814" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my sun-and-stars,” Dany said. Drogo would take his bloodriders and </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">ride in search of  <i>hrakkar</i>,  the great white lion of the plains. If they returned </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">triumphant, her lord husband’s joy would be fierce, and he might be willing to hear </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">her out. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Savage beasts he did not fear, nor any man who had ever drawn breath, but </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the sea was a different matter. To the Dothraki, water that a horse could not drink </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was something foul; the heaving grey-green plains of the ocean filled them with </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">superstitious loathing. Drogo was a bolder man than the other horselords in half a </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hundred ways, she  had found. . . but not in this. If only she could get him onto a </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">summoned her handmaids. Her body felt so fat and ungainly now that she </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">welcomed the help of their strong arms and deft hands, whereas before she had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">often been uncomfortable with the way they fussed and fluttered about her. They </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">scrubbed her clean and dressed her in sandsilk, loose and flowing. As Doreah </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="620" height="22" font="2">combed out her hair, she sent Jhiqui to find Ser Jorah Mormont. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The knight came at once. He wore horsehair leggings and painted vest, like a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rider. Coarse black hair covered his thick chest and muscular arms. “My princess. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="234" height="22" font="2">How may I serve you?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You must talk to my lord husband,” Dany said. “Drogo says the stallion who </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mounts the world will have all the lands of the earth to rule, and no need to cross </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the poison water. He talks of leading his  <i>khalasar</i>  east after Rhaego is born, to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="385" height="22" font="2">plunder the lands around the Jade Sea.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="774" height="22" font="2">The knight looked thoughtful. “The  <i>khal</i>  has never seen the Seven </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Kingdoms,” he said. “They are nothing to him. If he thinks of them at all, no doubt </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he thinks of islands, a few small cities clinging to rocks in the manner of Lorath or </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lys, surrounded by stormy seas. The riches of the east must seem a more tempting </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="104" height="22" font="2">prospect.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“But he must ride  <i>west</i>,” Dany said, despairing. “Please, help me make him </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">understand.” She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother had told her. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he would take her back one day, but </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="524" height="22" font="2">he was dead now and his promises had died with him. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons,” the knight </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">answered. “Have patience, Princess. Do not make your brother’s mistake. We will </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">go home, I promise you.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Home? The word made her feel sad. Ser Jorah had his Bear Island, but what </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was home to her? A few tales, names recited as solemnly as the words of a prayer, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the fading memory of a red door. . . was Vaes Dothrak to be her home forever? </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="788" height="22" font="2">When she looked at the crones of the <i>doshkhaleen</i>, was she looking at her future? </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah must have seen the sadness on her face. “A great caravan arrived </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">during the night, <i>Khaleesi</i>. Four hundred horses, from Pentos by way of Norvos and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Qohor, under the command of Merchant Captain Byan Votyris. Illyrio may have </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="572" height="22" font="2">sent a letter. Would you care to visit the Western Market?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Dany stirred. “Yes,” she said. “I would like that.” The markets came alive </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">when a caravan had come in. You could never tell what treasures the traders might </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bring this time, and it would be good to hear men speaking Valyrian again, as they </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="534" height="22" font="2">did in the Free Cities. “Irri, have them prepare a litter.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="509" height="22" font="2">“I shall tell your <i>khas</i>,” Ser Jorah said, withdrawing. </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">it was pleasant to lie back on soft cushions and be carried across Vaes Dothrak, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">with red silk curtains to shield her from the sun. Ser Jorah saddled up and rode </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">beside her, with the four young men of her <i>khas</i> and her handmaids. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The day was warm and cloudless, the sky a deep blue. When the wind blew, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she could smell the rich scents of grass and earth. As her litter passed beneath the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stolen monuments, she went from sunlight to shadow and back again. Dany swayed </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">along, studying the faces of dead heroes and forgotten kings. She wondered if the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">gods of burned cities could still answer prayers. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>If I were not the blood of the dragon</i>, she thought wistfully, <i>this could be my </i></text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>home</i>. She was <i>khaleesi</i>, she had a strong man and a swift horse, handmaids to serve </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her, warriors to keep her safe, an honored place in the  <i>doshkhaleen</i>  awaiting her </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">when she grew old. . . and in her womb grew a son who would one day bestride the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">world. That should be enough for any woman. . . but not for the dragon. With </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Viserys gone, Daenerys was the last, the very last. She was the seed of kings and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="619" height="22" font="2">conquerors, and so too the child inside her. She must not forget. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Western Market was a great square of beaten earth surrounded by warrens </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">of mud-baked brick, animal pens, whitewashed drinking halls. Hummocks rose </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from the ground like the backs of great subterranean beasts breaking the surface, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">yawning black mouths leading down to cool and cavernous storerooms below. The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">interior of the square was a maze of stalls and crookback aisles, shaded by awnings </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="157" height="22" font="2">of woven grass. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A hundred merchants and traders were unloading their goods and setting up in </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stalls when they arrived, yet even so the great market seemed hushed and deserted </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">compared to the teeming bazaars that Dany remembered from Pentos and the other </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Free Cities. The caravans made their way to Vaes Dothrak from east and west not </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">so much to sell to the Dothraki as to trade with each other, Ser Jorah had explained. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The riders let them come and go unmolested, so long as they observed the peace of </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the sacred city, did not profane the Mother of Mountains or the Womb of the </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">World, and honored the crones of the <i>doshkhaleen</i> with the traditional gifts of salt, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">silver, and seed. The Dothraki did not truly comprehend this business of buying and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">selling. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany liked the strangeness of the Eastern Market too, with all its queer sights </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and sounds and smells. She often spent her mornings there, nibbling tree eggs, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">locust pie, and green noodles, listening to the high ululating voices of the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">spellsingers, gaping at manticores in silver cages and immense grey elephants and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the striped black-and-white horses of the Jogos Nhai. She enjoyed watching all the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">people too: dark solemn Asshai’i and tall pale Qartheen, the bright-eyed men of Yi </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">Ti in monkey-tail hats, warrior maids from Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Kayakayanaya with iron rings in their nipples and rubies in their cheeks, even the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dour and frightening Shadow Men, who covered their arms and legs and chests with </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tattoos and hid their faces behind masks. The Eastern Market was a place of wonder </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="203" height="22" font="2">and magic for Dany. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="409" height="22" font="2">But the Western Market smelled of home. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">As Irri and Jhiqui helped her from her litter, she sniffed, and recognized the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sharp odors of garlic and pepper, scents that reminded Dany of days long gone in </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the alleys of Tyrosh and Myr and brought a fond smile to her face. Under that she </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smelled the heady sweet perfumes of Lys. She saw slaves carrying bolts of intricate </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Myrish lace and fine wools in a dozen rich colors. Caravan guards wandered among </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the aisles in copper helmets and knee-length tunics of quilted yellow cotton, empty </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">scabbards swinging from their woven leather belts. Behind one stall an armorer </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">displayed steel breastplates worked with gold and silver in ornate patterns, and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">helms hammered in the shapes of fanciful beasts. Next to him was a pretty young </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">woman selling Lannisport goldwork, rings and brooches and torcs and exquisitely </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wrought medallions suitable for belting. A huge eunuch guarded her stall, mute and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hairless, dressed in sweat-stained velvets and scowling at anyone who came close. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Across the aisle, a fat cloth trader from Yi Ti was haggling with a Pentoshi over the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">price of some green dye, the monkey tail on his hat swaying back and forth as he </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">shook his head. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“When I was a little girl, I loved to play in the bazaar,” Dany told Ser Jorah as </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they wandered down the shady aisle between the stalls. “It was so <i>alive</i> there, all the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">people shouting and laughing, so many wonderful things to look at. . . though we </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">seldom had enough coin to buy anything. . . well, except for a sausage now and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">again, or honeyfingers. . . do they have honeyfingers in the Seven Kingdoms, the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">kind they bake in Tyrosh?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Cakes, are they? I could not say, Princess.” The knight bowed. “If you would </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">pardon me for a time, I will seek out the captain and see if he has letters for us.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="347" height="22" font="2">“Very well. I’ll help you find him.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“There is no need for you to trouble yourself.” Ser Jorah glanced away </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">impatiently. “Enjoy the market. I will rejoin you when my business is concluded.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Curious</i>, Dany thought as she watched him stride off through the throngs. She </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">didn’t see why she should not go with him. Perhaps Ser Jorah meant to find a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">woman after he met with the merchant captain. Whores frequently traveled with the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">caravans, she knew, and some men were queerly shy about  their couplings. She </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="411" height="22" font="2">gave a shrug. “Come,” she told the others. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her handmaids trailed along as Dany resumed her stroll through the market. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Oh, look,” she exclaimed to Doreah, “those are the kind of sausages I meant.” She </text>

<page number="471" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pointed to a stall where a wizened little woman was grilling meat and onions on a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hot firestone. “They make them with lots of garlic and hot peppers.” Delighted with </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">her discovery, Dany insisted the others join her for a sausage. Her handmaids </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wolfed theirs down giggling and grinning, though the men of her <i>khas</i> sniffed at the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">grilled meat suspiciously. “They taste different than I remember,” Dany said after </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="181" height="22" font="2">her first few bites. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“In Pentos, I make them with pork,” the old woman said, “but all my pigs died </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on the Dothraki sea. These are made  of horsemeat,  <i>Khaleesi</i>,  but I spice them the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="72" height="22" font="2">same.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh.” Dany felt disappointed, but Quaro liked his sausage so well he decided </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to have another one, and Rakharo had to outdo him and eat three more, belching </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">loudly. Dany giggled. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You have not laughed since your brother the <i>Khal Rhaggat</i> was crowned by </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="453" height="22" font="2">Drogo,” said Irri. “It is good to see, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="650" height="22" font="2">Dany smiled shyly. It <i>was</i> sweet to laugh. She felt half a girl again. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They wandered for half the morning. She saw a beautiful feathered cloak from </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Summer Isles, and took it for a gift. In return, she gave the merchant a silver </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">medallion from her belt. That was how it was done among the Dothraki. A </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">birdseller taught a green-and-red parrot to say her name, and Dany laughed again, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yet still refused to take him. What would she do with a green-and-red parrot in a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="4"><i>khalasar</i>?  She did take a dozen flasks of scented oils, the perfumes of her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">childhood; she had only to close her eyes and sniff them and she could see the big </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">house with the red door once more. When Doreah looked longingly at a fertility </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">charm at a magician’s booth, Dany took that too and gave it to the handmaid, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">thinking that now she should find something for Irri and Jhiqui as well. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Turning a corner, they came upon a wine merchant offering thimble-sized </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cups of his wares to the passersby. “Sweet reds,” he cried in fluent Dothraki, “I </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have sweet reds, from Lys and Volantis and the Arbor. Whites from Lys, Tyroshi </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">pear brandy, firewine, pepperwine, the pale green nectars of Myr. Smokeberry </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">browns and Andalish sours, I have them, I have them.” He was a small man, slender </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and handsome, his flaxen hair curled and perfumed after the fashion of Lys. When </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Dany paused before his stall, he bowed low. “A taste for the  <i>khaleesi</i>?  I have a </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sweet red from Dorne, my lady, it sings of plums and cherries and rich dark oak. A </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="723" height="22" font="2">cask, a cup, a swallow? One taste, and you will name your child after me.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany smiled. “My son has his name, but I will try your summerwine,” she </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said in Valyrian, Valyrian as they spoke it in the Free Cities. The words felt strange </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="653" height="22" font="2">on her tongue, after so long. “Just a taste, if you would be so kind.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The merchant must have taken her for Dothraki, with her clothes and her oiled </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hair and sun-browned skin. When she spoke, he gaped at her in astonishment. “My </text>

<page number="472" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">lady, you are. . . Tyroshi? Can it be so?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My speech may be Tyroshi, and my garb Dothraki, but I am of Westeros, of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">the Sunset Kingdoms,” Dany told him. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Doreah stepped up beside her. “You have the honor to address Daenerys of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the House Targaryen, Daenerys Stormborn, <i>khaleesi</i> of the riding men and princess </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">of the Seven Kingdoms.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The wine merchant dropped to his knees. “Princess,” he said, bowing his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">head. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Rise,” Dany commanded him. “I would still like to taste that summerwine </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="147" height="22" font="2">you spoke of.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The man bounded to his feet. “That? Dornish swill. It is not worthy of a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">princess. I have a dry red from the Arbor, crisp and delectable. Please, let me give </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="124" height="22" font="2">you a cask.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo’s visits to the Free Cities had given him a taste for good wine, and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dany knew that such a noble vintage would please him. “You honor me, ser,” she </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">murmured sweetly. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The honor is mine.” The merchant rummaged about in the back of his stall </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and produced a small oaken cask. Burned into the wood was a cluster of grapes. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">“The Redwyne sigil,” he said, pointing, “for the Arbor. There is no finer drink.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Khal Drogo and I will share it together. Aggo, take this back to my litter, if </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">you’d be so kind.” The wineseller beamed as the Dothraki hefted the cask. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She did not realize that Ser Jorah had returned until she heard the knight say, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="651" height="22" font="2">“<i>No</i>.” His voice was strange, brusque. “Aggo, put down that cask.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Aggo looked at Dany. She gave a hesitant nod. “Ser Jorah, is something </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">wrong?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="358" height="22" font="2">“I have a thirst. Open it, wineseller.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The merchant frowned. “The wine is for the <i>khaleesi</i>, not for the likes of you, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">ser.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah moved closer to the stall. “If you don’t open it, I’ll crack it open </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with your head.” He carried no weapons here in the sacred city, save his hands—yet </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his hands were enough, big, hard, dangerous, his knuckles covered with coarse dark </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hairs. The wineseller hesitated a moment, then took up his hammer and knocked the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">plug from the cask. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Pour,” Ser Jorah commanded. The four young warriors of Dany’s  <i>khas</i> </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">arrayed themselves behind him, frowning, watching with their dark, almond-shaped </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="55" height="22" font="2">eyes. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It would be a crime to drink this rich a wine without letting it breathe.” The </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">wineseller had not put his hammer down. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jhogo reached for the whip coiled at his belt, but Dany stopped him with a </text>

<page number="473" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">light touch on the arm. “Do as Ser Jorah says,” she said. People were stopping to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">watch. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The man gave her a quick, sullen glance. “As the princess commands.” He </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had to set aside his hammer to lift the cask. He filled two thimble-sized tasting cups, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="392" height="22" font="2">pouring so deftly he did not spill a drop. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="541" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah lifted a cup and sniffed at the wine, frowning. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Sweet, isn’t it?” the wineseller said, smiling. “Can you smell the fruit, ser? </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The perfume of the Arbor. Taste it, my lord, and tell me it isn’t the finest, richest </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">wine that’s ever touched your tongue.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="485" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah offered him the cup. “You taste it first.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Me?” The man laughed. “I am not worthy of this vintage, my lord. And it’s a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">poor wine merchant who drinks up his own wares.” His smile was amiable, yet she </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="404" height="22" font="2">could see the sheen of sweat on his brow. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You <i>will</i> drink,” Dany said, cold as ice. “Empty the cup, or I will tell them to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="701" height="22" font="2">hold you down while Ser Jorah pours the whole cask down your throat.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The wineseller shrugged, reached for the cup. . . and grabbed the cask instead, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">flinging it at her with both hands. Ser Jorah bulled into her, knocking her out of the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">way. The cask bounced off his shoulder and smashed open on the ground. Dany </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stumbled and lost her feet. “<i>No</i>,” she screamed, thrusting her hands out to break her </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">fall. . . and Doreah caught her by the arm and wrenched her backward, so she </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">landed on her legs and not her belly. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The trader vaulted over the stall, darting between Aggo and Rakharo. Quaro </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">reached for an  <i>arakh</i>  that was not there as the blond man slammed him aside.  He </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raced down the aisle. Dany heard the snap of Jhogo’s whip, saw the leather lick out </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">and coil around the wineseller’s leg. The man sprawled face first in the dirt. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">A dozen caravan guards had come running. With them was the master </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">himself, Merchant Captain Byan Votyris, a diminutive Norvoshi with skin like old </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leather and a bristling blue mustachio that swept up to his ears. He seemed to know </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">what had happened without a word being spoken. “Take this one away to await the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pleasure of the  <i>khal</i>,” he commanded, gesturing at the man on the ground. Two </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">guards hauled the wineseller to his feet. “His goods I gift to you as well, Princess,” </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the merchant captain went on. “Small token of regret, that one of mine would do </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">this thing.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Doreah and Jhiqui helped Dany back to her feet. The poisoned wine was </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">leaking from the broken cask into the dirt. “How did you know?” she asked Ser </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="254" height="22" font="2">Jorah, trembling. “<i>How?</i>” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I did not know, <i>Khaleesi</i>, not until the man refused to drink, but once I read </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio’s letter, I feared.”  His dark eyes swept over the faces of the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="573" height="22" font="2">strangers in the market. “Come. Best not to talk of it here.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany was near tears as they carried her back. The taste in her mouth was one </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she had known before: fear. For years she had lived in terror of Viserys, afraid of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">waking the dragon. This was even worse. It was not just for herself that she feared </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">now, but for her baby. He must have sensed her fright, for he moved restlessly </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">inside her. Dany stroked the swell of her belly gently, wishing she could reach him, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">touch him, soothe him. “You are the blood of the dragon, little one,” she whispered </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as her litter swayed along, curtains drawn tight. “You are the blood of the dragon, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="295" height="22" font="2">and the dragon does not fear.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Under the hollow hummock of earth that was her home in Vaes Dothrak, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dany ordered them to leave her—all but Ser Jorah. “Tell me,” she commanded as </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="593" height="22" font="2">she lowered herself onto her cushions. “Was it the Usurper?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” The knight drew out a folded parchment. “A letter to Viserys, from </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Magister Illyrio. Robert Baratheon offers lands and lordships for your death, or </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">your brother’s.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My brother?” Her sob was half a laugh. “He does not know yet, does he? The </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Usurper owes Drogo a lordship.” This time her laugh was half a sob. She hugged </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="501" height="22" font="2">herself protectively. “And me, you said. Only me?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="409" height="22" font="2">“You and the child,” Ser Jorah said, grim. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No. He cannot have my son.” She would not weep, she decided. She would </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">not shiver with fear.  <i>The Usurper has woken the dragon now</i>,  she told </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">herself. . . and her eyes went to the dragon’s eggs resting in their nest of dark velvet. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The shifting lamplight limned their stony scales, and shimmering motes of jade and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">scarlet and gold swam in the air around them, like courtiers around a king. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Was it madness that seized her then, born of fear? Or some strange wisdom </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">buried in her blood? Dany could not have said. She heard her own voice saying, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">“Ser Jorah, light the brazier.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>?” The knight looked at her strangely. “It is so hot. Are you </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">certain?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="721" height="22" font="2">She had never been so certain. “Yes. I. . . I have a chill. Light the brazier.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="313" height="22" font="2">He bowed. “As you command.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When the coals were afire, Dany sent Ser Jorah from her. She had to be alone </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">to do what she must do. <i>This is madness</i>, she told herself as she lifted the black-and-</text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">scarlet egg from the velvet.  <i>It will only crack and burn, and it’s so beautiful, Ser </i></text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="540" height="22" font="4"><i>Jorah will call me a fool if I ruin it</i>, and yet, and yet. . .  </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to the fire and pushed it down </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">amongst the burning coals. The black scales seemed to glow as they drank the heat. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Flames licked against the stone with small red tongues. Dany placed the other two </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">eggs beside the black one in the fire. As she stepped back from the brazier, the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">breath trembled in her throat. </text>
</page>
<page number="475" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She watched until the coals had turned to ashes. Drifting sparks floated up and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">out of the smokehole. Heat shimmered in waves around the dragon’s eggs. And that </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">was all. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon</i>, Ser Jorah had said. Dany gazed at </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her eggs sadly. What had she expected? A thousand thousand years ago they had </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been alive, but now they were only pretty rocks. They could not make a dragon. A </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="513" height="22" font="2">dragon was air and fire. Living flesh, not dead stone. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The brazier was cold again by the time Khal Drogo returned. Cohollo was </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leading a packhorse behind him, with the carcass of a great white lion slung across </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">its back. Above, the stars were coming out. The <i>khal</i> laughed as he swung down off </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his stallion and showed her the scars on his leg where the <i>hrakkar</i>  had raked him </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">through his leggings. “I shall make  you a cloak of its skin, moon of my life,” he </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="69" height="22" font="2">swore. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When Dany told him what had happened at the market, all laughter stopped, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="323" height="22" font="2">and Khal Drogo grew very quiet. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“This poisoner was the first,” Ser Jorah Mormont warned him, “but he will </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">not be the last. Men will risk much for a lordship.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Drogo was silent for a time. Finally he said, “This seller of poisons ran from </text>

<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">give him Seven Kingdoms. I, Drogo, <i>khal</i>, will do this thing.” His voice rose, and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he lifted his fist to the sky. “I will take my <i>khalasar</i> west to where the world ends, </text>

<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His <i>khalasar</i> left Vaes Dothrak two days later, striking south and west across </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the plains. Khal Drogo led them on his great red stallion, with Daenerys beside him </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on her silver. The wineseller hurried behind them, naked, on foot, chained at throat </text>

<text top="456" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Let us not keep them waiting any longer, ser.” Ser Brynden Tully put the </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">spurs to his horse and trotted briskly toward the banners. Catelyn rode beside him. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Wylis and his brother Ser Wendel followed, leading their levies, near </text>

<text top="566" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mounted lances, swordsmen, and freeriders, and the rest foot, armed with spears, </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">pikes and tridents. Lord Wyman had remained behind to see to the defenses of </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">White Harbor. A man of near sixty years, he had grown too stout to sit a horse. “If I </text>

<text top="676" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he’d told Catelyn when he met her ship, slapping his massive belly with both hands. </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">His fingers were fat as sausages. “My boys will see you safe to your son, though, </text>

<text top="759" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His “boys” were both older than Catelyn, and she might have wished that they </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">did not take after their father quite so closely. Ser Wylis was only a few eels short </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of not being able to mount his own horse; she pitied the poor animal. Ser Wendel, </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the younger boy, would have been the fattest man she’d ever known, had she only </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">neglected to meet his father and brother. Wylis was quiet and formal, Wendel loud </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and boisterous; both had ostentatious walrus mustaches and heads as bare as a </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">baby’s bottom; neither seemed to own a single garment that was not spotted with </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">food stains. Yet she liked them well enough; they had gotten her to Robb, as their </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">spot of high ground dry enough for a camp. Ser Wylis called a halt there, and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remained behind with his men to see the fires laid and the horses tended, while his </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">brother Wendel rode on with Catelyn and her uncle to present their father’s respects </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The ground under their horses’ hooves was soft and wet. It fell away slowly </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">beneath them as they rode past smoky peat fires, lines of horses, and wagons heavy-</text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">laden with hardbread and salt beef. On a stony outcrop of land higher than the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">surrounding country, they passed a lord’s pavilion with walls of heavy sailcloth. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Catelyn recognized the banner, the bull moose of the Hornwoods, brown on its dark </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">orange field. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Just beyond, through the mists, she glimpsed the walls and towers of Moat </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Cailin. . . or what remained of them. Immense blocks of black basalt, each as large </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">as a crofter’s cottage, lay scattered and tumbled like a child’s wooden blocks, half-</text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sunk in the soft boggy soil. Nothing else remained of a curtain wall that had once </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stood as high as Winterfell’s. The wooden keep was gone entirely, rotted away a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thousand years past, with not so much as a timber to mark where it had stood. All </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">that was left of the great stronghold of the First Men were three towers. . . three </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="676" height="22" font="2">where there had once been twenty, if the taletellers could be believed. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Gatehouse Tower looked sound enough, and even boasted a few feet of </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">standing wall to either side of it. The Drunkard’s Tower, off in the bog where the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">south and west walls had once met, leaned like a man about to spew a bellyful of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wine into the gutter. And the tall, slender Children’s Tower, where legend said the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">children of the forest had once called upon their nameless gods to send the hammer </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the waters, had lost half its crown. It looked as if some great beast had taken a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bite out of the crenellations along the tower top, and spit the rubble across the bog. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">All three towers were green with moss. A tree was growing out between the stones </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on the north side of the Gatehouse Tower, its gnarled limbs festooned with ropy </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="275" height="22" font="2">white blankets of ghostskin. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Gods have mercy,” Ser Brynden exclaimed when he saw what lay before </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="494" height="22" font="2">them. “<i>This </i>is Moat Cailin? It’s no more than a—” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“—death trap,” Catelyn finished. “I know how it looks, Uncle. I thought the </text>

<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">than it seems. The three surviving towers command the causeway from all sides, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and any enemy must pass between them. The bogs here are impenetrable, full of </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">quicksands and suckholes and teeming with snakes. To assault any of the towers, an </text>

<page number="478" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">army would need to wade through waist-deep black muck, cross a moat full of </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lizard-lions, and scale walls slimy with moss, all the while exposing themselves to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fire from archers in the other towers.” She gave her uncle a grim smile. “And when </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">night falls, there are said to be ghosts, cold vengeful spirits of the north who hunger </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">for southron blood.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Brynden chuckled. “Remind me not to linger here. Last I looked, I was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="178" height="22" font="2">southron myself.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Standards had been raised atop all three towers. The Karstark sunburst hung </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from the Drunkard’s Tower, beneath the direwolf; on the Children’s Tower it was </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the Greatjon’s giant in shattered chains. But on the Gatehouse Tower, the Stark </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">banner flew alone. That was where Robb had made his seat. Catelyn made for it, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with Ser Brynden and Ser Wendel behind her, their horses stepping slowly down </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="804" height="22" font="2">the log-and-plank road that had been laid across the green-and-black fields of mud. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She found her son surrounded by his father’s lords bannermen, in a drafty hall </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with a peat fire smoking in a black hearth. He was seated at a massive stone table, a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pile of maps and papers in front of him, talking intently with Roose Bolton and the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Greatjon. At first he did not notice her. . . but his wolf did. The great grey beast was </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lying near the fire, but when Catelyn entered he lifted his head, and his golden eyes </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">met hers. The lords fell silent one by one, and Robb looked up at the sudden quiet </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="601" height="22" font="2">and saw her. “<i>Mother?</i>” he said, his voice thick with emotion. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn wanted to run to him, to kiss his sweet brow, to wrap him in her arms </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and hold him so tightly that he would never come to harm. . . but here in front of his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lords, she dared not. He was playing a man’s part now, and she would not take that </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">away from him. So she held herself at the far end of the basalt slab they were using </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">for a table. The direwolf got to his feet and padded across the room to where she </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stood. It seemed bigger than a wolf ought to be. “You’ve grown a beard,” she said </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="429" height="22" font="2">to Robb, while Grey Wind sniffed her hand. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He rubbed his stubbled jaw, suddenly awkward. “Yes.” His chin hairs were </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="321" height="22" font="2">redder than the ones on his head. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I like it.” Catelyn stroked the wolfs head, gently. “It makes you look like my </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brother Edmure.” Grey Wind nipped at her fingers, playful, and trotted back to his </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="167" height="22" font="2">place by the fire. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Helman Tallhart was the first to follow the direwolf across the room to </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pay his respects, kneeling before her and pressing his brow to  her hand. “Lady </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Catelyn,” he said, “you are fair as ever, a welcome sight in troubled times.” The </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Glovers followed, Galbart and Robett, and Greatjon Umber, and the rest, one by </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">one. Theon Greyjoy was the last. “I had not looked to see you here, my lady,” he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">said as he knelt. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I had not thought to be here,” Catelyn said, “until I came ashore at White </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Harbor, and Lord Wyman told me that Robb had called the banners. You know his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">son, Ser Wendel.” Wendel Manderly stepped forward and bowed as low as his girth </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would allow. “And my uncle, Ser Brynden Tully, who has left my sister’s service </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">for mine.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Blackfish,” Robb said. “Thank you for joining us, ser. We need men of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">your courage. And you, Ser Wendel, I am glad to have you here. Is Ser Rodrik with </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="386" height="22" font="2">you as well, Mother? I’ve missed him.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Ser Rodrik is on his way north from White Harbor. I have named him </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">castellan and commanded him to hold Winterfell till our return. Maester Luwin is a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="478" height="22" font="2">wise counsellor, but unskilled in the arts of war.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Have no fear on that count, Lady Stark,” the Greatjon told her in his bass </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rumble. “Winterfell is safe. We’ll shove our swords up Tywin Lannister’s bunghole </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="802" height="22" font="2">soon enough, begging your pardons, and then it’s on to the Red Keep to free Ned.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My lady, a question, as it please you.” Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had a small voice, yet when he spoke larger men quieted to listen. His eyes were </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">curiously pale, almost without color, and his look disturbing. “It is said that you </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hold Lord Tywin’s dwarf son as captive. Have you brought him to us? I vow, we </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">should make good use of such a hostage.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I did hold Tyrion Lannister, but no longer,” Catelyn was forced to admit. A </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">chorus of consternation greeted the news. “I was no more pleased than you, my </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lords. The gods saw fit to free him, with some help from my fool of a sister.” She </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ought not to be so open in her contempt, she knew, but her parting from the Eyrie </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had not been pleasant. She had offered to take Lord Robert with her, to foster him at </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Winterfell for a few years. The company of other boys would do him good, she had </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dared to suggest. Lysa’s rage had been frightening to behold. “Sister or no,” she had </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">replied, “if you try to steal my son, you will leave by the Moon Door.” After that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">there was no more to be said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The lords were anxious to question her further, but Catelyn raised a hand. “No </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">doubt we will have time for all this later, but my journey has fatigued me. I would </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">speak with my son alone. I know you will forgive me, my lords.” She gave them no </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">choice; led by the ever-obliging Lord Hornwood, the bannermen bowed and took </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">their leave. “And you, Theon,” she added when Greyjoy lingered. He smiled and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">left them. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">There was ale and cheese on the table. Catelyn tilled a horn, sat, sipped, and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">studied her son. He seemed taller than when she’d left, and the wisps of beard did </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="749" height="22" font="2">make him look older. “Edmure was sixteen when he grew his first whiskers.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="424" height="22" font="2">“I will be sixteen soon enough,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“And you are fifteen now. Fifteen, and leading a host to battle. Can you </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">understand why I might fear, Robb?” </text>
</page>
<page number="480" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="485" height="22" font="2">His look grew stubborn. “There was no one else.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No one?” she said. “Pray, who were those men I saw here a moment ago? </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Roose Bolton, Rickard Karstark, Galbart and Robett Glover, the Greatjon, Helman </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tallhart. . . you might have given the command to any of them. Gods be good, you </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="637" height="22" font="2">might even have sent Theon, though he would not be my choice.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="300" height="22" font="2">“They are not Starks,” he said. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“They are  <i>men</i>,  Robb, seasoned in battle. You were fighting with wooden </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="289" height="22" font="2">swords less than a year past.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She saw anger in his eyes at that, but it was gone as quick as it came, and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">suddenly he was a boy again. “I know,” he said, abashed. “Are you. . . are you </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">sending me back to Winterfell?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn sighed. “I should. You ought never have left. Yet I dare not, not now. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">You have come too far. Someday these lords will look to you as their liege. If I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">pack you off now, like a child being sent to bed without his supper, they will </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remember, and laugh about it in their cups. The day will come when you need them </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to respect you, even fear you a little. Laughter is poison to fear. I will not do that to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="440" height="22" font="2">you, much as I might wish to keep you safe.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“You have my thanks, Mother,” he said, his relief obvious beneath the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">formality. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She reached across his table and touched his hair. “You are my firstborn, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">Robb. I have only to look at you to remember the day you came into the world, red-</text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">faced and squalling.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He rose, clearly uncomfortable with her touch, and walked to the hearth. Grey </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="662" height="22" font="2">Wind rubbed his head against his leg. “You know. . . about Father?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” The reports of Robert’s sudden death and Ned’s fall had frightened </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Catelyn more than she could say, but she would not let her son see her fear. “Lord </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Manderly told me when I landed at White Harbor. Have you had any word of your </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">sisters?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“There was a letter,” Robb said, scratching his direwolf under the jaw. “One </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">for you as well, but it came to Winterfell with mine.” He went to the table, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rummaged among some maps and papers, and returned with a crumpled parchment. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="607" height="22" font="2">“This is the one she wrote me, I never thought to bring yours.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Something in Robb’s tone troubled her. She smoothed out the paper and read. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Concern gave way to disbelief, then to anger, and lastly to fear. “This is Cersei’s </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">letter, not your sister’s,” she said when she was done. “The real message is in what </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Sansa does not say. All this about how kindly and gently the Lannisters are treating </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her. . . I know the sound of a threat, even whispered. They have Sansa hostage, and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">they mean to keep her.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="585" height="22" font="2">“There’s no mention of Arya,” Robb pointed out, miserable. </text>
</page>
<page number="481" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="750" height="22" font="2">“No.” Catelyn did not want to think what that might mean, not now, not here. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I had hoped. . . if you still held the Imp, a trade of hostages. . .”  He took </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Sansa’s letter and crumpled it in his fist, and she could tell from the way he did it </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that it was not the first time. “Is there word from the Eyrie? I wrote to Aunt Lysa, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">asking help. Has she called Lord Arryn’s banners, do you know? Will the knights of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">the Vale come join us?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Only one,” she said, “the best of them, my uncle. . . but Brynden Blackfish </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="702" height="22" font="2">was a Tully first. My sister is not about to stir beyond her Bloody Gate.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robb took it hard. “Mother, what are we going to  <i>do</i>?  I brought this whole </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">army together, eighteen thousand men, but I don’t. . . I’m not certain. . .” He looked </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to her, his eyes shining, the proud young lord melted away in an instant, and quick </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">as that he was a child again, a fifteen-year-old boy looking to his mother for </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">answers. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="159" height="22" font="2">It would not do. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="517" height="22" font="2">“What are you so afraid of, Robb?” she asked gently. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I. . .” He turned his head away, to hide the first tear. “If we march. . . even if </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">we win. . . the Lannisters hold Sansa, and Father. They’ll kill them, won’t they?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="270" height="22" font="2">“They want us to think so.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="267" height="22" font="2">“You mean they’re lying?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I do not know, Robb. What I do know is that you have no choice. If you go </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to King’s Landing and swear fealty, you will never be allowed to leave. If you turn </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">your tail and retreat to Winterfell, your lords will lose all respect for you. Some may </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">even go over to the Lannisters. Then the queen, with that much less to fear, can do </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as she likes with her prisoners. Our best hope, our  <i>only</i>  true hope, is that you can </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">defeat the foe in the field. If you should chance to take Lord Tywin or the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Kingslayer captive, why then a trade might very well be possible, but that is not the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">heart of it. So long as you have power enough that they must fear you, Ned and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">your sister should be safe. Cersei is wise enough to know that she may need them to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="506" height="22" font="2">make her peace, should the fighting go against her.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“What if the fighting  <i>doesn’t</i>  go against her?” Robb asked. “What if it goes </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="123" height="22" font="2">against us?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn took his hand. “Robb, I will not soften the truth for you. If you lose, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">there is no hope for any of us. They say there is naught but stone at the heart of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="568" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock. Remember the fate of Rhaegar’s children.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She saw the fear in his young eyes then, but there was a strength as well. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="326" height="22" font="2">“Then I will not lose,” he vowed. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Tell me what you know of the fighting in the riverlands,” she said. She had </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="288" height="22" font="2">to learn if he was truly ready. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">pass, but the Kingslayer descended on them and put them to flight. Lord Vance was </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">slain. The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">brother and his other bannermen at Riverrun, with Jaime Lannister on his heels. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">That’s not the worst of it, though. All the time they were battling in the pass, Lord </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tywin was bringing a second Lannister army around from the south. It’s said to be </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="292" height="22" font="2">even larger than Jaime’s host. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">under the king’s own banner. He gave the command to some southron lordling, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of Father’s own </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">guardsmen. Only it was a trap. Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the Lannisters fell upon him, the king’s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">took them in the rear as they tried to pull back across the Mummer’s Ford. This </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser Raymun </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell. Lord Tywin has closed off the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">kingsroad, it’s said, and now he’s marching north toward Harrenhal, burning as he </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="67" height="22" font="2">goes.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="4"><i>Grim and grimmer</i>, thought Catelyn. It was worse than she’d imagined. “You </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">mean to meet him here?” she asked. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If he comes so far, but no one thinks he will,” Robb said. “I’ve sent word to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Howland Reed, Father’s old friend at Greywater Watch. If the Lannisters come up </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the Neck, the crannogmen will bleed them every step of the  way, but Galbart </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Glover says Lord Tywin is too smart for that, and Roose Bolton agrees. He’ll stay </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">close to the Trident, they believe, taking the castles of the river lords one by one, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="648" height="22" font="2">until Riverrun stands alone. We need to march south to meet him.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">The very idea of it chilled Catelyn to the bone. What chance would a fifteen-</text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">year-old boy have against seasoned battle commanders like Jaime and Tywin </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lannister? “Is that wise? You are strongly placed here. It’s said that the old Kings </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the North could stand at Moat Cailin and throw back hosts ten times the size of </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes, but our food and supplies are running low, and this is not land we can </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">live off easily. We’ve been waiting for Lord Manderly, but now that his sons have </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="292" height="22" font="2">joined us, we need to march.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">She was hearing the lords bannermen speaking with her son’s voice, she </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">realized. Over the years, she had hosted many of them at Winterfell, and been </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">welcomed with Ned to their own hearths and tables. She knew what sorts of men </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">they were, each one. She wondered if Robb did. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And yet there was sense in what they said. This host her son had assembled </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">force of guardsmen paid in coin. Most of them were smallfolk: crofters, fieldhands, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fishermen, sheepherders, the sons of innkeeps and traders and tanners, leavened </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with a smattering of sellswords and freeriders hungry for plunder. When their lords </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">called, they came. . . but not forever. “Marching is all very well,” she said to her </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="638" height="22" font="2">son, “but <i>where</i>, and to what purpose? What do you mean to do?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb hesitated. “The Greatjon thinks we should take the battle to Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and surprise him,” he said, “but the Glovers and the Karstarks feel we’d be wiser to </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">go around his army and join up with Uncle Ser Edmure against the Kingslayer.” He </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ran his fingers through his shaggy mane of auburn hair, looking unhappy. “Though </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="516" height="22" font="2">by the time we reach Riverrun. . . I’m not certain. . .” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“<i>Be  </i>certain,” Catelyn told her son, “or go home and take up that wooden </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her son looked at her, startled, as if he could not credit what he was hearing. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="223" height="22" font="2">“As you say, Mother.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">“I’ll ask you again. What do <i>you</i> mean to do?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb drew a map across the table, a ragged piece of old leather covered with </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lines of faded paint. One end curled up from being rolled; he weighed it down with </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his dagger. “Both plans have virtues, but. . . look, if we try to swing around Lord </text>

<text top="804" left="54" width="389" height="22" font="2">puzzling over the map. “Tell me more.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I’d leave a small force here to hold Moat Cailin, archers mostly, and march </text>

<text top="998" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">but pleased with himself and hungry for her praise. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Catelyn frowned down at the map. “You’d put a river between the two parts </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>The Late Lord Frey</i>, Catelyn thought. “He is,” she admitted, “but my father </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="390" height="22" font="2">has never trusted him. Nor should you.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="480" height="22" font="2">“I won’t,” Robb promised. “What do you think?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She was impressed despite herself. <i>He looks like a Tully</i>, she thought, <i>yet he’s </i></text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>still his father’s son, and Ned taught him well</i>. “Which force would you command?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The horse,” he answered at once. Again like his father; Ned would always </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">take the more dangerous task himself. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="170" height="22" font="2">“And the other?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Greatjon is always saying that we should smash Lord Tywin. I thought </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">I’d give him the honor.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was his first misstep, but how to make him see it without wounding his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fledgling confidence? “Your father once told me that the Greatjon was as fearless as </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb grinned. “Grey Wind ate two of his fingers, and he <i>laughed</i> about it. So </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="175" height="22" font="2">you agree, then?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Your father is not fearless,” Catelyn pointed out. “He is brave, but that is </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="154" height="22" font="2">very different.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Her son considered that for a moment. “The eastern host will be all that stands </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">between Lord Tywin and Winterfell,” he said thoughtfully. “Well, them and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whatever few bowmen I leave here at the Moat. So I don’t want someone fearless, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="65" height="22" font="2">do I?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="569" height="22" font="2">“No. You want cold cunning, I should think, not courage.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="573" height="22" font="2">“Roose Bolton,” Robb said at once. “That man scares me.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="554" height="22" font="2">“Then let us pray he will scare Tywin Lannister as well.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb nodded and rolled up the map. “I’ll give the commands, and assemble </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="410" height="22" font="2">an escort to take you home to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had fought to keep herself strong, for Ned’s sake and for this stubborn </text>

<text top="456" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Brothers, Black Ears, and Burned Men, and those just the seed of the army he </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hoped to grow. Gunthor son of Gurn was raising the other clans even now. He </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wondered what his lord father would make of them in their skins and bits of stolen </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">steel. If truth be told, he did not know what to make of them himself. Was he their </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commander or their captive? Most of the time, it seemed to be a little of both. “It </text>

<text top="621" left="108" width="741" height="22" font="2">“Best for Tyrion son of Tywin,” said Ulf, who spoke for the Moon Brothers. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Shagga glowered, a fearsome sight to see. “Shagga son of Dolf likes this not. </text>

<text top="787" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Why should we trust your word?” Chella was a small hard woman, flat as a </text>

<text top="842" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You wound me, Chella,” Tyrion said. “Here I thought we had become such </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The Stone Crows rode together, and Chella and Ulf stayed close as well, as </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Moon Brothers and Black Ears had strong bonds between them. Timett son of </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Men, who mortified their flesh with fire to prove their courage and (the others said) </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">roasted babies at their feasts. And even the other Burned Men feared Timett, who </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">had put out his own left eye with a white-hot knife when he reached the age of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">manhood. Tyrion gathered that it was more customary for a boy to burn off a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">nipple, a finger, or (if he was truly brave, or truly mad) an ear. Timett’s fellow </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Burned Men were so awed by his choice of an eye that they promptly named him a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="534" height="22" font="2">red hand, which seemed to be some sort of a war chief. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I wonder what their king burned off,” Tyrion said to Bronn when he heard </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the tale. Grinning, the sellsword had tugged at his crotch. . . but even Bronn kept a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">respectful tongue around Timett. If a man was mad enough to put out his own eye, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">he was unlikely to be gentle to his enemies. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Distant watchers peered down from towers of unmortared stone as the party </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">descended through the foothills, and once Tyrion saw a raven take wing. Where the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">high road twisted between two rocky outcrops, they came to the first strong point. A </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">low earthen wall four feet high closed off the road, and a dozen crossbowmen </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">manned the heights. Tyrion halted his followers out of range and rode to the wall </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="451" height="22" font="2">alone. “Who commands here?” he shouted up. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The captain was quick to appear, and even quicker to give them an escort </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he recognized his lord’s son. They trotted past blackened fields and burned </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">holdfasts, down to the riverlands and the Green Fork of the Trident. Tyrion saw no </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bodies, but the air was full of ravens and carrion crows; there had been fighting </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">here, and recently. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Half a league from the crossroads, a barricade of sharpened stakes had been </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">erected, manned by pikemen and archers. Behind the line, the camp spread out to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the far distance. Thin fingers of smoke rose from hundreds of cookfires, mailed men </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sat under trees and honed their blades, and familiar banners fluttered from staffs </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="292" height="22" font="2">thrust into the muddy ground. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">A party of mounted horsemen rode forward to challenge them as they </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">approached the stakes. The knight who led them wore silver armor inlaid with </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">amethysts and a striped purple-and-silver cloak. His shield bore a unicorn sigil, and </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Flement Brax lifted his visor. “Tyrion,” he said in astonishment. “My lord, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="829" height="22" font="2">we all feared you dead, or. . .”  He looked at the clansmen uncertainly. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">“These. . . companions of yours. . .” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Bosom friends and loyal retainers,” Tyrion said. “Where will I find my lord </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">father?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="546" height="22" font="2">“He has taken the inn at the crossroads for his quarters.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion laughed. The inn at the crossroads! Perhaps the gods were just after all. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">“I will see him at once.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lord.” Ser  Flement wheeled his horse about and shouted </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">commands. Three rows of stakes were pulled from the ground to make a hole in the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">line. Tyrion led his party through. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin’s camp spread over leagues. Chella’s estimate of twenty thousand </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">men could not be far wrong. The common men camped out in the open, but the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">knights had thrown up tents, and some of the high lords had erected pavilions as </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">large as houses. Tyrion spied the red ox of the Presters, Lord Crakehall’s brindled </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">boar, the burning tree of Marbrand, the badger of Lydden. Knights called out to him </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="795" height="22" font="2">as he cantered past, and men-at-arms gaped at the clansmen in open astonishment. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Shagga was gaping back; beyond a certainty, he had never seen so many men, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">horses, and weapons in all his days. The rest of the mountain brigands did a better </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">job of guarding their faces, but Tyrion had no doubts that they were full as much in </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">awe. Better and better. The more impressed they were with the power of the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="483" height="22" font="2">Lannisters, the easier they would be to command. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The inn and its stables were much as he remembered, though little more than </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tumbled stones and blackened foundations remained where the rest of the village </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had stood. A gibbet had been erected in the yard, and the body that swung there was </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">covered with ravens. At Tyrion’s approach they took to the air, squawking and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">flapping their black wings. He dismounted and glanced up at what remained of the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">corpse. The birds had eaten her lips and eyes and most of her cheeks, baring her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stained red teeth in a hideous smile. “A room, a meal, and a flagon of wine, that was </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="517" height="22" font="2">all I asked,” he reminded her with a sigh of reproach. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Boys emerged hesitantly from the stables to see to their horses. Shagga did not </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">want to give his up. “The lad won’t steal your mare,” Tyrion assured him. “He only </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wants to give her some oats and water and brush out her coat.” Shagga’s coat could </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have used a good brushing too, but it would have been less than tactful to mention </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">it. “You have my word, the horse will not be harmed.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Glaring, Shagga let go his grip on the reins. “This is the horse of Shagga son </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="351" height="22" font="2">of Dolf,” he roared at the stableboy. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If he doesn’t give her back, chop off his manhood and feed it to the goats,” </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">Tyrion promised. “Provided you can find some.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A pair of house guards in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms stood under </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the inn’s sign, on either side of the door. Tyrion recognized their captain. “My </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">father?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="313" height="22" font="2">“In the common room, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My men will want meat and mead,” Tyrion told him. “See that they get it.” </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="400" height="22" font="2">He entered the inn, and there was Father. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tywin Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West, was in his </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">middle fifties, yet hard as a man of twenty. Even seated, he was tall, with long legs, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">broad shoulders, a flat stomach. His thin arms were corded with muscle. When his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">once-thick golden hair had begun to recede, he had commanded his barber to shave </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his head; Lord Tywin did not believe in half measures. He razored his lip and chin </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">as well, but kept his side-whiskers, two great thickets of wiry golden hair that </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">covered most of  his cheeks from ear to jaw. His eyes were a pale green, flecked </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with gold. A fool more foolish than most had once jested that even Lord Tywin’s </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shit was flecked with gold. Some said the man was still alive, deep in the bowels of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">Casterly Rock. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan Lannister, his father’s only surviving brother, was sharing a flagon </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of ale with Lord Tywin when Tyrion entered the common room. His uncle was </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">portly and balding, with a close-cropped yellow beard that followed the line of his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="659" height="22" font="2">massive jaw. Ser Kevan saw him first. “Tyrion,” he said in surprise. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Uncle,” Tyrion said, bowing. “And my lord father. What a pleasure to find </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">you here.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin did not stir from his chair, but he did give his dwarf son a long, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">searching look. “I see that the rumors of your demise were unfounded.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Sorry to disappoint you, Father,” Tyrion said. “No need to leap up and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">embrace me, I wouldn’t want you to strain yourself.” He crossed the room to their </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">table, acutely conscious of the way his stunted legs made him waddle with every </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">step. Whenever his father’s eyes were on him, he became uncomfortably aware of </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all his deformities and shortcomings. “Kind of you to go to war for me,” he said as </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="676" height="22" font="2">he climbed into a chair and helped himself to a cup of his father’s ale. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“By my lights, it was you who started this,” Lord Tywin replied. “Your </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">brother Jaime would never have meekly submitted to capture at the hands of a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">woman.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That’s one way we differ, Jaime and I. He’s taller as well, you may have </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">noticed.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His father ignored the sally. “The honor of our House was at stake. I had no </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="637" height="22" font="2">choice but to ride. No man sheds Lannister blood with impunity.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Hear Me Roar</i>,” Tyrion said, grinning. The Lannister words. “Truth be told, </text>

<page number="489" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">none of my blood was actually shed, although it was a close thing once or twice. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="297" height="22" font="2">Morrec and Jyck were killed.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="472" height="22" font="2">“I suppose you will be wanting some new men.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Don’t trouble yourself, Father, I’ve acquired a few of my own.” He tried a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">swallow of the ale. It was brown and yeasty, so thick you could almost chew it. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Very fine, in truth. A pity his father had hanged the innkeep. “How is your war </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="82" height="22" font="2">going?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His uncle answered. “Well enough, for the nonce. Ser Edmure had scattered </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">small troops of men along his borders to stop our raiding, and your lord father and I </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="707" height="22" font="2">were able to destroy most of them piecemeal before they could regroup.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Your brother has been covering himself with glory,” his father said. “He </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">smashed the Lords Vance and Piper at the Golden Tooth, and met the massed power </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the Tullys under the walls of Riverrun. The lords of the Trident have been put to </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">rout. Ser Edmure Tully was taken captive, with many of his knights and bannermen. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lord Blackwood led a few survivors back to Riverrun, where Jaime has them under </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">siege. The rest fled to their own strongholds.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Your father and  I have been marching on each in turn,” Ser Kevan said. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">“With Lord Blackwood gone, Raventree fell at once, and Lady Whent yielded </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Harrenhal for want of men to defend it. Ser Gregor burnt out the Pipers and the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">Brackens. . .” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="391" height="22" font="2">“Leaving you unopposed?” Tyrion said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Not wholly,” Ser Kevan said. “The Mallisters still hold Seagard and Walder </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="422" height="22" font="2">Frey is marshaling his levies at the Twins.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No matter,” Lord Tywin said. “Frey only takes the field when the scent of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">victory is in the air, and all he smells now is ruin. And Jason Mallister lacks the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">strength to fight alone. Once Jaime takes Riverrun, they will both be quick enough </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to bend the knee. Unless the Starks and the Arryns come forth to oppose us, this </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">war is good as won.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I would not fret overmuch about the Arryns if I were you,” Tyrion said. “The </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="415" height="22" font="2">Starks are another matter. Lord Eddard—” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“—is our hostage,” his father said. “He will lead no armies while he rots in a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">dungeon under the Red Keep.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No,” Ser Kevan agreed, “but his son has called the banners and sits at Moat </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="375" height="22" font="2">Cailin with a strong host around him.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No sword is strong until it’s been tempered,” Lord Tywin declared. “The </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Stark boy is a child. No doubt he likes the sound of warhorns well enough, and the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sight of his banners fluttering in the wind, but in the end it comes down to butcher’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">work. I doubt he has the stomach for it.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Things  <i>had</i>  gotten interesting while he’d been away, Tyrion reflected. “And </text>

<page number="490" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">what is our fearless monarch doing whilst all this ‘butcher’s work’ is being done?” </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he wondered. “How has my lovely and persuasive sister gotten Robert to agree to </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="2">the imprisonment of his dear friend Ned?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Robert Baratheon is dead,” his father told him. “Your nephew reigns in </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="174" height="22" font="2">King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That <i>did</i> take Tyrion aback. “My sister, you mean.” He took another gulp of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ale. The realm would be a much different place with Cersei ruling in place of her </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">husband. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If you have a mind to make yourself of use, I will give you a command,” his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">father said. “Marq Piper and Karyl Vance are loose in our rear, raiding our lands </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="214" height="22" font="2">across the Red Fork.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion made a <i>tsk</i>ing sound. “The gall of them, fighting back. Ordinarily I’d </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">be glad to punish such rudeness, Father, but the truth is, I have pressing business </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">elsewhere.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Do you?” Lord Tywin did not seem awed. “We also have a pair  of Ned </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Stark’s afterthoughts making a nuisance of themselves by harassing my foraging </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">parties. Beric Dondarrion, some young lordling with delusions of valor. He has that </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fat jape of a priest with him, the one who likes to set his sword on fire. Do you think </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you might be able to deal with them as you scamper off? Without making too much </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="143" height="22" font="2">a botch of it?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Tyrion wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and smiled. “Father, it </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">warms my heart to think that you might entrust me with. . . what, twenty men? </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Fifty? Are you sure you can spare so many? Well, no matter. If I should come </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">across Thoros and Lord Beric, I shall spank them both.” He climbed down from his </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">chair and waddled to the sideboard, where a wheel of veined white cheese sat </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">surrounded by fruit. “First, though, I have some promises of my own to keep,” he </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">said as he sliced off a wedge. “I shall require three thousand helms and as many </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hauberks, plus swords, pikes, steel spearheads, maces, battleaxes, gauntlets, gorgets, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">greaves, breastplates, wagons to carry all this—” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The door behind him opened with a crash, so violently that Tyrion almost </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dropped his cheese. Ser Kevan leapt up swearing as the captain of the guard went </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">flying across the room to smash against the hearth. As he tumbled down into the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">cold ashes, his lion helm askew, Shagga snapped the man’s sword in two over a </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knee thick as a tree trunk, threw down the pieces, and lumbered into the common </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">room. He was preceded by his stench, riper than the cheese and overpowering in the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">closed space. “Little redcape,” he snarled, “when next you bare steel on Shagga son </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="600" height="22" font="2">of Dolf, I will chop off your manhood and roast it in the fire.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">“What, no goats?” Tyrion said, taking a bite of cheese. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The other clansmen followed Shagga into the common room, Bronn with </text>

<page number="491" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">them. The sellsword gave Tyrion a rueful shrug. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="541" height="22" font="2">“Who might you be?” Lord Tywin asked, cool as snow. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“They followed me home, Father,” Tyrion explained. “May I keep them? </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="222" height="22" font="2">They don’t eat much.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">No one was smiling. “By what right do you savages intrude on our councils?” </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">demanded Ser Kevan. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Savages, lowlander?” Conn might have been handsome if you washed him. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="637" height="22" font="2">“We are free men, and free men by rights sit on all war councils.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="423" height="22" font="2">“Which one is the lion lord?” Chella asked. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“They are both old men,” announced Timett son of Timett, who had yet to see </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">his twentieth year. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan’s hand went to his sword hilt, but his brother placed two fingers on </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his wrist and held him fast. Lord Tywin seemed unperturbed. “Tyrion, have you </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">forgotten your courtesies? Kindly acquaint us with our. . . honored guests.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion licked his fingers. “With pleasure,” he said. “The fair maid is Chella </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">daughter of Cheyk of the Black Ears.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“I’m no maid,” Chella protested. “My sons have taken fifty ears among </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">them.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“May they take fifty more.” Tyrion waddled away from her. “This is Conn </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">son of Coratt. Shagga son of Dolf is the one who looks like Casterly Rock with hair. </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">They are Stone Crows. Here is Ulf son of Umar of the Moon Brothers, and here </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn, a sellsword </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of no particular allegiance. He has already changed sides twice in the short time </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">I’ve known him, you and he ought to get on famously, Father.” To Bronn and the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">clansmen he said, “May I present my lord father, Tywin son of Tytos of House </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, Shield of Lannisport, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="345" height="22" font="2">once and future Hand of the King.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin rose, dignified and correct. “Even in the west, we know the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">prowess of the warrior clans of the Mountains of the Moon. What brings you down </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">from your strongholds, my lords?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="227" height="22" font="2">“Horses,” said Shagga. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="547" height="22" font="2">“A promise of silk and steel,” said Timett son of Timett. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion was about to tell his lord father how he proposed to reduce the Vale of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Arryn to a smoking wasteland, but he was never given the chance. The door banged </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">“It will be as you command.” The rider took his leave. </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The boy may hang back or lose his courage when he sees our numbers,” </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin replied. “The sooner the Starks are broken, the sooner I shall be free to </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="302" height="22" font="2">“As you will,” Ser Kevan said. </text>

<text top="501" left="108" width="517" height="22" font="2">“It is said truly,” Conn of the Stone Crows answered. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="324" height="22" font="2">“And the women,” Chella added. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ride with me against my enemies, and you shall have all my son promised </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Would you pay us with our own coin?” Ulf son of Umar said. “Why should </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="546" height="22" font="2">we need the father’s promise, when we have the son’s?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I said nothing of  <i>need</i>,” Lord Tywin replied. “My words were courtesy, </text>

<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Red Keep so long as she promised not to go beyond the walls, a promise Sansa </text>

<text top="649" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">flowers in Myrcella’s garden, and visit the sept to pray for her father. Sometimes </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">she prayed in the godswood as well, since the Starks kept the old gods. </text>

<text top="869" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa slipped in among them, murmuring greetings as she worked her way </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">toward the front. She recognized black-skinned Jalabhar Xho, gloomy Ser Aron </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Santagar, the Redwyne twins Horror and Slobber. . . only none of them seemed to </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Grand Maester Pycelle was seated alone at the council table, seemingly </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">asleep, his hands clasped together atop his beard. She saw Lord Varys hurry into the </text>

<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">tall doors in the rear, smiling. He chatted amiably with Ser Balon and Ser Dontos as </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he made his way to the front. Butterflies fluttered nervously in Sansa’s stomach. <i>I </i></text>

<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When Joffrey turned to look out over the hall, his eye caught Sansa’s. He </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">smiled, seated himself, and spoke. “It is a king’s duty to punish the disloyal and </text>

<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa glimpsed motion from the corner of her eye as Janos Slynt made his </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">entrance. This time the muttering was louder and angrier. Proud lords whose houses </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">statue, but now he went to one knee and bowed his head. “Your Grace, I am yours </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="142" height="22" font="2">to command.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="732" height="22" font="2">“Rise, Ser Barristan,” Cersei Lannister said. “You may remove your helm.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My lady?” Standing, the old knight took off his high white helm, though he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">did not seem to understand why. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You have served the realm long and faithfully, good ser, and every man and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks. Yet now I fear your service is at </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">an end. It is the wish of king and council that you lay down your heavy burden.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="386" height="22" font="2">“My. . . burden? I fear I. . . I do not. . .” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The new-made lord, Janos Slynt, spoke up, his voice heavy and blunt. “Her </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Grace is trying to tell you that you are relieved as Lord Commander of the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The tall, white-haired knight seemed to shrink as he stood there, scarcely </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">breathing. “Your Grace,” he said at last. “The Kingsguard is a Sworn Brotherhood. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Our vows are taken for life. Only death may relieve the Lord Commander of his </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">sacred trust.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Whose death, Ser Barristan?” The queen’s voice was soft as silk, but her </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="657" height="22" font="2">words carried the whole length of the hall. “Yours, or your king’s?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You let my father die,” Joffrey said accusingly from atop the Iron Throne. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="361" height="22" font="2">“You’re too old to protect anybody.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa watched as the knight peered up at his new king. She had never seen </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him look his years before, yet now he did. “Your Grace,” he said. “I was chosen for </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the White Swords in my twenty-third year. It was all I had ever dreamed, from the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moment I first took sword in hand. I gave up all claim to my ancestral keep. The </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">girl I was to wed married my cousin in my place, I had no need of land or sons, my </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">life would be lived for the realm. Ser Gerold Hightower himself heard my </text>

<text top="942" left="108" width="472" height="22" font="2">“And all of them dead,” Littlefinger pointed out. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Your time is done,” Cersei Lannister announced. “Joffrey requires men </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">around him who are young and strong. The council has determined that Ser Jaime </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Kingslayer,” Ser Barristan said, his voice hard with contempt. “The false </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="799" height="22" font="2">knight who profaned his blade with the blood of the king he had sworn to defend.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Have a care for your words, ser,” the queen warned. “You are speaking of </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="442" height="22" font="2">our beloved brother, your king’s own blood.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Lord Varys spoke, gentler than the others. “We are not unmindful of your </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">service, good ser. Lord Tywin Lannister has generously agreed to grant you a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">handsome tract of land north of Lannisport, beside the sea, with gold and men </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">sufficient to build you a stout keep, and servants to see to your every need.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan looked up sharply. “A hall to die in, and men to bury me. I thank </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">you, my lords. . . but I spit upon your pity.” He reached up and undid the clasps that </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">held his cloak in place, and the heavy white garment slithered from his shoulders to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fall in a heap on the floor. His helmet dropped with a <i>clang</i>. “I am a knight,” he told </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them. He opened the silver fastenings of his breastplate and let that fall as well. “I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">shall die a knight.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="532" height="22" font="2">“A naked knight, it would seem,” quipped Littlefinger. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They all laughed then, Joffrey on his throne, and the lords standing </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">attendance, Janos Slynt and Queen Cersei and Sandor Clegane and even the other </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">men of the Kingsguard, the five who had been his brothers until a moment ago. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>Surely that must have hurt the most</i>, Sansa thought. Her heart went out to the gallant </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">old man as he stood shamed and red-faced, too angry to speak. Finally he drew his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">sword. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Sansa heard someone gasp. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn moved forward to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">confront him, but Ser Barristan froze them in place with a look that dripped </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">contempt. “Have no fear, sers, your king is safe. . . no thanks to you. Even now, I </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">could cut through the five of you as easy as a dagger cuts cheese. If you would </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">serve under the Kingslayer, not a one of you is fit to wear the white.” He flung his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sword at the foot of the Iron Throne. “Here, boy. Melt it down and add it to the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">others, if you like. It will do you more good than the swords in the hands of these </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">five. Perhaps Lord Stannis will chance to sit on it when he takes your throne.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He took the long way out, his steps ringing loud against the floor and echoing </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">off the bare stone walls. Lords and ladies parted to let him pass. Not until the pages </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had closed the great oak-and-bronze doors behind him did Sansa hear sounds again: </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">soft voices, uneasy stirrings, the shuffle of papers from the council table. “He called </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">me <i>boy</i>,” Joffrey said peevishly, sounding younger than his years. “He talked about </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">my uncle Stannis too.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="562" height="22" font="2">“Idle talk,” said Varys the eunuch. “Without meaning. . .” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“He could be making plots with my uncles. I want him seized and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">questioned.” No one moved. Joffrey raised his voice. “I said, <i>I want him seized!</i>” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Janos Slynt rose from the council table. “My gold cloaks will see to it, Your </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="80" height="22" font="2">Grace.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Good,” said King Joffrey. Lord Janos strode from the hall, his ugly sons </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">double-stepping to keep up as they lugged the great metal shield with the arms of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">House Slynt. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Your Grace,” Littlefinger reminded the king. “If we might resume, the seven </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="751" height="22" font="2">are now six. We find ourselves in need of a new sword for your Kingsguard.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="359" height="22" font="2">Joffrey smiled. “Tell them, Mother.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The king and council have determined that no man in the Seven Kingdoms is </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="775" height="22" font="2">more fit to guard and protect His Grace than his sworn shield, Sandor Clegane.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="483" height="22" font="2">“How do you like that, dog?” King Joffrey asked. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The Hound’s scarred face was hard to read. He took a long moment to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">consider. “Why not? I have no lands nor wife to forsake, and who’d care if I did?” </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="798" height="22" font="2">The burned side of his mouth twisted. “But I warn you, I’ll say no knight’s vows.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard have always been knights,” Ser Boros </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">said firmly. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="687" height="22" font="2">“Until now,” the Hound said in his deep rasp, and Ser Boros fell silent. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">When the king’s herald moved forward, Sansa realized the moment was </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">almost at hand. She smoothed down the cloth of her skirt nervously. She was </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">dressed in mourning, as a sign of respect for the dead king, but she had taken </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">special care to make herself beautiful. Her gown was the ivory silk that the queen </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had given her, the one Arya had ruined, but she’d had them dye it black and you </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">couldn’t see the stain at all. She had fretted over her jewelry for hours and finally </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">decided upon the elegant simplicity of a plain silver chain. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The herald’s voice boomed out. “If any man in this hall has other matters to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="711" height="22" font="2">set before His Grace, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa quailed. <i>Now</i>, she told herself, <i>I must do it now. Gods give me courage</i>. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">She took one step, then another. Lords and knights stepped aside silently to let her </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pass, and she felt the weight of their eyes on her.  <i>I must be as strong as my lady </i></text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="619" height="22" font="4"><i>mother</i>. “Your Grace,” she called out in a soft, tremulous voice. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The height of the Iron Throne gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">else in the hall. He was the first to see her. “Come forward, my lady,” he called out, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">smiling. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His smile emboldened her, made her feel beautiful and strong.  <i>He does love </i></text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>me, he does</i>. Sansa lifted her head and walked toward him, not too slow and not too </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="515" height="22" font="2">fast. She must not let them see how nervous she was. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="505" height="22" font="2">“The Lady Sansa, of House Stark,” the herald cried. </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She stopped under the throne, at the spot where Ser Barristan’s white cloak </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">lay puddled on the floor beside his helm and breastplate. “Do you have some </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="759" height="22" font="2">business for king and council, Sansa?” the queen asked from the council table. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I do.” She knelt on the cloak, so as not to spoil her gown, and looked up at </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her prince on his fearsome black throne. “As it please Your Grace, I ask mercy for </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">my father, Lord Eddard Stark, who was the Hand of the King.” She had practiced </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">the words a hundred times. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The queen sighed. “Sansa, you disappoint me. What did I tell you about </text>

<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ah, poor sad thing,” sighed Varys. “She is only a babe, my lords, she does </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="251" height="22" font="2">not know what she asks.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa had eyes only for Joffrey.  <i>He must listen to me, he must</i>,  she thought. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The king shifted on his seat, “Let her speak,” he commanded. “I want to hear what </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="102" height="22" font="2">she says.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, Your Grace.” Sansa smiled, a shy secret smile, just for him. He </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">was listening. She knew he would. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Treason is a noxious weed,” Pycelle declared solemnly. “It must be torn up, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">root and stem and seed, lest new traitors sprout from every roadside.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="549" height="22" font="2">“Do you deny your father’s crime?” Lord Baelish asked. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No, my lords.” Sansa knew better than that. “I know he must be punished. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">All I ask is mercy. I know my lord father must regret what he did. He was King </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert’s friend and he loved him, you all know he loved him. He never wanted to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">be Hand until the king asked him. They must have lied to him. Lord Renly or Lord </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="606" height="22" font="2">Stannis or. . . or <i>somebody</i>, they must have lied, otherwise. . .” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">King Joffrey leaned forward, hands grasping the arms of the throne. Broken </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sword points fanned out between his fingers. “He said I wasn’t the king. Why did </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="130" height="22" font="2">he say that?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“His leg was broken,” Sansa replied eagerly. “It hurt ever so much, Maester </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy, and they say that milk of the poppy fills </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="615" height="22" font="2">your head with clouds. Otherwise he would never have said it.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Varys said, “A child’s faith. . . such sweet innocence. . . and yet, they say </text>

<text top="998" left="108" width="438" height="22" font="2">“Treason is treason,” Pycelle replied at once. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="488" height="22" font="2">Joffrey rocked restlessly on the throne. “Mother?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Cersei Lannister considered Sansa thoughtfully. “If Lord Eddard were to </text>

<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remembered the jest the king had shared in the crypts of Winterfell, as the Kings of </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Winter looked on with cold stone eyes.  <i>The king eats</i>,  Robert had said,  <i>and the </i></text>

<text top="593" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The dungeon was under the Red Keep, deeper than he dared imagine. He </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remembered the old stories about Maegor the Cruel, who murdered all the masons </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="622" height="22" font="2">who labored on his castle, so they might never reveal its secrets. </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He damned them all: Littlefinger, Janos Slynt and his gold cloaks, the queen, </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the Kingslayer, Pycelle and Varys and Ser Barristan, even Lord Renly, Robert’s </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">own blood, who had run when he was needed most. Yet in the end he blamed </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="673" height="22" font="2">himself. “<i>Fool</i>,” he cried to the darkness, “thrice-damned blind fool.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Cersei Lannister’s face seemed to float before him in the darkness. Her hair </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was full of sunlight, but there was mockery in her smile. “When you play the game </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of thrones, you win or you die,” she whispered. Ned had  played and lost, and his </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">men had paid the price of his folly with their life’s blood. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">When he thought of his daughters, he would have wept gladly, but the tears </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would not come. Even now, he was a Stark of Winterfell, and his grief and his rage </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">froze hard inside him. </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When he kept very still, his leg did not hurt so much, so he did his best to lie </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">unmoving. For how long he could not say. There was no sun and no moon. He </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could not see to mark the walls. Ned closed his eyes and opened them; it made no </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">difference. He slept and woke and slept again. He did not know which was more </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">painful, the waking or the sleeping. When he slept, he dreamed: dark disturbing </text>

<page number="502" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dreams of blood and broken promises. When he woke, there was nothing to do but </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">think, and his waking thoughts were worse than nightmares. The thought of Cat was </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as painful as a bed of nettles. He wondered where she was, what she was doing. He </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="463" height="22" font="2">wondered whether he would ever see her again. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Hours turned to days, or so it seemed. He could feel a dull ache in his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shattered leg, an itch beneath the plaster. When he touched his thigh, the flesh was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hot to his fingers. The only sound was his breathing. After a time, he began to talk </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">aloud, just to hear a voice. He made plans to keep himself sane, built castles of hope </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the dark. Robert’s brothers were out in the world, raising armies at Dragonstone </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Storm’s End. Alyn and Harwin would return to King’s Landing with the rest of </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his household guard once they had dealt with Ser Gregor. Catelyn would raise the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">north when  the word reached her, and the lords of river and mountain and Vale </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="152" height="22" font="2">would join her. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He found himself thinking of Robert more and more. He saw the king as he </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had been in the flower of his youth, tall and handsome, his great antlered helm on </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his head, his warhammer in hand, sitting his horse like a horned god. He heard his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">laughter in the dark, saw his eyes, blue and clear as mountain lakes. “Look at us, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ned,” Robert said. “Gods, how did we come to this? You here, and me killed by a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">pig. We won a throne together. . .” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>I failed you</i>, Robert, Ned thought. He could not say the words. <i>I lied to you, </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="4"><i>hid the truth. I let them kill you</i>. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The king heard him. “You stiff-necked fool,” he muttered, “too proud to </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">listen. Can you eat pride, Stark? Will honor shield your children?” Cracks ran down </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his face, fissures opening in the flesh, and he reached up and ripped the mask away. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">It was not Robert at all; it was Littlefinger, grinning, mocking him. When he opened </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">his mouth to speak, his lies turned to pale grey moths and took wing. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Ned was half-asleep when the footsteps came down the hall. At first he </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thought he dreamt them; it had been so long since he had heard anything but the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sound of his own voice. Ned was feverish by then, his leg a dull agony, his lips </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">parched and cracked. When the heavy wooden door creaked open, the sudden light </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">was painful to his eyes. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A gaoler thrust a jug at him. The clay was cool and beaded with moisture. Ned </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">grasped it with both hands and gulped eagerly. Water ran from his mouth and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dripped down through his beard. He drank until he thought he would be sick. “How </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="559" height="22" font="2">long. . .?” he asked weakly when he could drink no more. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The gaoler was a scarecrow of a man with a rat’s face and frayed beard, clad </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in a mail shirt and a leather half cape. “No talking,” he said as he wrenched the jug </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="184" height="22" font="2">from Ned’s hands. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Please,” Ned said, “my daughters. . .” The door crashed shut. He blinked as </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the light vanished, lowered his head to his chest, and curled up on the straw. It no </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="550" height="22" font="2">longer stank of urine and shit. It no longer smelled at all. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">He could no longer tell the difference between waking and sleeping. The </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">memory came creeping upon him in the darkness, as vivid as a dream. It was the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">year of false spring, and he was eighteen again, down from the Eyrie to the tourney </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">at Harrenhal. He could see the deep green of the grass, and smell the pollen on the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wind. Warm days and cool nights and the sweet taste of wine. He remembered </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Brandon’s laughter, and Robert’s berserk valor in the melee, the way he laughed as </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he unhorsed men left and right. He remembered Jaime Lannister, a golden youth in </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">scaled white armor, kneeling on the grass in front of the king’s pavilion and making </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his vows to protect and defend King Aerys. Afterward, Ser Oswell Whent helped </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Jaime to his feet, and the White Bull  himself, Lord Commander Ser Gerold </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Hightower, fastened the snowy cloak of the Kingsguard about his shoulders. All six </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">White Swords were there to welcome their newest brother. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Yet when the jousting began, the day belonged to Rhaegar Targaryen. The </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">crown prince wore the armor he would die in: gleaming black plate with the three-</text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">headed dragon of his House wrought in rubies on the breast. A plume of scarlet silk </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">streamed behind him when he rode, and it seemed no lance could touch him. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Brandon fell to him, and Bronze Yohn Royce, and even the splendid Ser Arthur </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="336" height="22" font="2">Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion’s crown. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lay the queen of beauty’s laurel in Lyanna’s lap. He could see it still: a crown of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">winter roses, blue as frost. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark reached out his hand to grasp the flowery crown, but beneath the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pale blue petals the thorns lay hidden. He felt them clawing at his skin, sharp and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cruel, saw the slow trickle of blood run down his fingers, and woke, trembling, in </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">the dark. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>Promise me</i>, Ned, his sister had whispered from her bed of blood. She had </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">loved the scent of winter roses. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="457" height="22" font="2">“Gods save me,” Ned wept. “I am going mad.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="332" height="22" font="2">The gods did not deign to answer. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Each time the turnkey brought him water, he told himself another day had </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">passed. At first he would beg the man for some word of his daughters and the world </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">beyond his cell. Grunts and kicks were his only replies. Later, when the stomach </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">cramps began, he begged for food instead. It made no matter; he was not fed. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Perhaps the Lannisters meant for him to starve to death. “No,” he told himself. If </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Cersei had wanted him dead, he would have been cut down in the throne room with </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">his men. She wanted him alive. Weak, desperate, yet alive. Catelyn held her </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">brother; she dare not kill him or the Imp’s life would be forfeit as well. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">From outside his cell came the rattle of iron chains. As the door creaked open, </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Ned put a hand to the damp wall and pushed himself toward the light. The glare of a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="427" height="22" font="2">torch made him squint. “Food,” he croaked. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Wine,” a voice answered. It was not the rat-faced man; this gaoler was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">stouter, shorter, though he wore the same leather half cape and spiked steel cap. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">“Drink, Lord Eddard.” He thrust a wineskin into Ned’s hands. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The voice was strangely familiar, yet it took Ned Stark a moment to place it. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">“<i>Varys?</i>” he said groggily when it came. He touched the man’s face. “I’m </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">not. . . not dreaming this. You’re here.” The eunuch’s plump cheeks were covered </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a dark stubble of beard. Ned felt the coarse hair with his fingers.  Varys had </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">transformed himself into a grizzled turnkey, reeking of sweat and sour wine. “How </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="422" height="22" font="2">did you. . . what sort of magician are you?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="449" height="22" font="2">“A thirsty one,” Varys said. “Drink, my lord.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="748" height="22" font="2">Ned’s hands fumbled at the skin. “Is this the same poison they gave Robert?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You wrong me,” Varys said sadly. “Truly, no one loves a eunuch. Give me </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the skin.” He drank, a trickle of red leaking from the corner of his plump mouth. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Not the equal of the vintage you offered me the night of the tourney, but no more </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="593" height="22" font="2">poisonous than most,” he concluded, wiping his lips. “Here.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ned tried a swallow. “Dregs.” He felt as though he were about to bring the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="140" height="22" font="2">wine back up. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“All men must swallow the sour with the sweet. High lords and eunuchs alike. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">Your hour has come, my lord.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="190" height="22" font="2">“My daughters. . .” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The younger girl escaped Ser Meryn and fled,” Varys told him. “I have not </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">been able to find her. Nor have the Lannisters. A kindness, there. Our new king </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">loves her not. Your older girl is still betrothed to Joffrey. Cersei keeps her close. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">She came to court a few days ago to plead that you be spared. A pity you couldn’t </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">have been there, you would have been touched.” He leaned forward intently. “I trust </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="502" height="22" font="2">you realize that you are a dead man, Lord Eddard?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The queen will not kill me,” Ned said. His head swam; the wine was strong, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">and it had been too long since he’d eaten. “Cat. . . Cat holds her brother. . .” </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ned frowned. “When they slaughtered my guard, you stood beside the queen </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="343" height="22" font="2">and watched, and said not a word.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“And would again. I seem to recall that I was unarmed, unarmored, and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">surrounded by Lannister swords.” The eunuch looked at him curiously, tilting his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">head. “When I was a young boy, before I was cut, I traveled with a troupe of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mummers through the Free Cities. They taught me that each man has a role to play, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in life as well as mummery. So it is at court. The King’s Justice must be fearsome, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the master of coin must be frugal, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard must be </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">valiant. . . and the master of whisperers must be sly and obsequious and without </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scruple. A courageous informer would be as useless as a cowardly knight.” He took </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">the wineskin back and drank. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ned studied the eunuch’s face, searching for truth beneath the mummer’s </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">scars and false stubble. He tried some more wine. This time it went down easier. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">“Can you free me from this pit?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I could. . . but <i>will</i> I? No. Questions would be asked, and the answers would </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="174" height="22" font="2">lead back to me.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="434" height="22" font="2">Ned had expected no more. “You are blunt.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A eunuch has no honor, and a spider does not enjoy the luxury of scruples, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">my lord.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="588" height="22" font="2">“Would you at least consent to carry a message out for me?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That would depend on the message. I will gladly provide you with paper and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ink, if you like. And when you have written what you will, I will take the letter and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="561" height="22" font="2">read it, and deliver it or not, as best serves my own ends.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="513" height="22" font="2">“Your own ends. What ends are those, Lord Varys?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Peace,” Varys replied without hesitation. “If there was one soul in King’s </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me.” He </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sighed. “For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies, but I could not protect </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him from his friends. What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">had learned the truth of Joffrey’s birth?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="393" height="22" font="2">“The madness of mercy,” Ned admitted. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Ah,” said Varys. “To be sure. You are an honest and honorable man, Lord </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Eddard. Ofttimes I forget that. I have met so few of them in my life.” He glanced </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">around the cell. “When I see what honesty and honor have won you, I understand </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">why.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ned Stark laid his head back against the damp stone wall and closed his eyes. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="685" height="22" font="2">His leg was throbbing. “The king’s wine. . . did you question Lancel?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Oh, indeed. Cersei gave him the wineskins, and told him it was Robert’s </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">favorite vintage.” The eunuch shrugged. “A hunter lives a perilous life. If the boar </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">adder, an arrow gone astray. . . the forest is the abattoir of the gods. It was not wine </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">that killed the king. It was your <i>mercy</i>.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">Ned had feared as much. “Gods forgive me.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“If there are gods,” Varys said, “I expect they will. The queen would not have </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">waited long in any case. Robert was becoming unruly, and she needed to be rid of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him to free her hands to deal with his brothers. They are quite a pair, Stannis and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Renly. The iron gauntlet and the silk glove.” He wiped his mouth with the back of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his hand. “You have been foolish, my lord. You ought to have heeded Littlefinger </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="508" height="22" font="2">when he urged you to support Joffrey’s succession.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="390" height="22" font="2">“How. . . how could you know of that?” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Varys smiled. “I know, that’s all that need concern you. I also know that on </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="423" height="22" font="2">the morrow the queen will pay you a visit.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="356" height="22" font="2">Slowly Ned raised his eyes. “Why?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Cersei is frightened of you, my  lord. . . but she has other enemies she fears </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">even more. Her beloved Jaime is fighting the river lords even now. Lysa Arryn sits </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the Eyrie, ringed in stone and steel, and there is no love lost between her and the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">queen. In Dorne, the Martells still brood  on the murder of Princess Elia and her </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="812" height="22" font="2">babes. And now your son marches down the Neck with a northern host at his back.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="385" height="22" font="2">“Robb is only a boy,” Ned said, aghast. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“A boy with an army,” Varys said. “Yet only a boy, as you say. The king’s </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brothers are the ones  giving Cersei sleepless nights. . . Lord Stannis in particular. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">just man. No one knows  what Stannis has been doing on Dragonstone, but I will </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">wager you that he’s gathered more swords than seashells. So here is Cersei’s </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">nightmare: while her father and brother spend their power battling Starks and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tullys, Lord Stannis will land, proclaim himself king, and lop off her son’s curly </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">blond head. . . and her own in the bargain, though I truly believe she cares more </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="153" height="22" font="2">about the boy.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Stannis Baratheon is Robert’s true heir,” Ned said. “The throne is his by </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="356" height="22" font="2">rights. I would welcome his ascent.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Varys  <i>tsk</i>ed. “Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you. Stannis may </text>

<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">that tongue of yours. Sansa begged so sweetly, it would be a shame if you threw it </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">all away. You are being given your life back, if you’ll take it. Cersei is no fool. She </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="502" height="22" font="2">knows a tame wolf is of more use than a dead one.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“You want me to  <i>serve</i>  the woman who murdered my king, butchered my </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="638" height="22" font="2">men, and crippled my son?” Ned’s voice was thick with disbelief. </text>

<page number="507" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I want you  to serve the realm,” Varys said. “Tell the queen that you will </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">confess your vile treason, command your son to lay down his sword, and proclaim </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Joffrey as the true heir. Offer to denounce Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Our green-eyed lioness knows you are a man of honor. If you will give her the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">peace she needs and the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">your grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the rest of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="714" height="22" font="2">your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son of yours.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The thought of Jon filled Ned with a sense of shame, and a sorrow too deep </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">for words. If only he could see the boy again, sit and talk with him. . . pain shot </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">through his broken leg, beneath the filthy grey plaster of his cast. He winced, his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fingers opening and closing helplessly. “Is this your own scheme,” he gasped out at </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">Varys, “or are you in league with Littlefinger?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">That seemed to amuse the eunuch. “I would sooner wed the Black Goat of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Qohor. Littlefinger is the second most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms. Oh, I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">feed him choice whispers, sufficient so that he  <i>thinks</i>  I am his. . . just as I allow </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="279" height="22" font="2">Cersei to believe I am hers.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“And just as you let me believe that you were mine. Tell me, Lord Varys, who </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="201" height="22" font="2">do you truly serve?” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Varys smiled thinly. “Why, the realm, my good lord, how ever could you </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">doubt that? I swear it by my lost manhood. I serve the realm, and the realm needs </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">peace.” He finished the last swallow of wine, and tossed the empty skin aside. “So </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">what is your  answer, Lord Eddard? Give me your word that you’ll tell the queen </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="476" height="22" font="2">what she wants to hear when she comes calling.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor. My life is </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">not so precious to me as that.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Pity.” The eunuch stood. “And your daughter’s life, my lord? How precious </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">is that?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">A chill pierced Ned’s heart. “My daughter. . .” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Surely you did not think I’d forgotten about your sweet innocent, my lord? </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="340" height="22" font="2">The queen most certainly has not.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“<i>No</i>,” Ned pleaded, his voice cracking. “Varys, gods have mercy, do as you </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">like with me, but leave my daughter out of your schemes. Sansa’s no more than a </text>

<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Rhaenys was a child too. Prince Rhaegar’s daughter. A precious little thing, </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">younger than your girls. She had a small black kitten she called Balerion, did you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">know? I always wondered what happened to him. Rhaenys liked to pretend he was </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the true Balerion, the Black Dread of old, but I imagine the Lannisters taught her </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the difference between a kitten and a dragon quick enough, the day they broke </text>

<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">many days to the south. . . but Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="629" height="22" font="2">force of near four thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Late again,” Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all over, </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">damn the man. Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by rights, Lord Frey </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="652" height="22" font="2">should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun, yet here he sat. </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Four thousand men,” Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. “Lord Frey </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself. Surely he means to join his power to </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">ours.” </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Does he?” Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and Robett </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">Glover, his companion of the day. The vanguard spread out behind them, a slow-</text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">moving forest of lances and banners and spears. “I wonder. Expect nothing of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">Walder Frey, and you will never be surprised.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="320" height="22" font="2">“He’s your father’s bannerman.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb. And Lord </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would have liked. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister’s sister. That means little of itself, to be </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many children over the years, and they must </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="308" height="22" font="2">needs marry someone. Still. . .” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?” Robett </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">Glover asked gravely. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn sighed. “If truth be told, I doubt even Lord Frey knows what Lord </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Frey intends to do. He has an old man’s caution and a young man’s ambition, and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="300" height="22" font="2">has never lacked for cunning.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We must have the Twins, Mother,” Robb said heatedly. “There is no other </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">way across the river. You know that.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="558" height="22" font="2">“Yes. And so does Walder Frey, you can be sure of that.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">That night they made camp on the southern edge of the bogs, halfway between </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the kingsroad and the river. It was there Theon Greyjoy brought them further word </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">from her uncle. “Ser Brynden says to tell you he’s crossed swords with the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lannisters. There are a dozen scouts who won’t be reporting back to Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">anytime soon. Or ever.” He grinned. “Ser Addam Marbrand commands their </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">outriders, and he’s pulling back south, burning as he goes. He knows where we are, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="680" height="22" font="2">more or less, but the Blackfish vows he will not know when we split.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Unless Lord Frey tells him,” Catelyn said sharply. “Theon, when you return </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the Twins, day  and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">night, with orders to bring down any raven they see leaving the battlements. I want </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">no birds bringing word of my son’s movements to Lord Tywin.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Ser Brynden has seen to it already, my lady,” Theon replied with a cocky </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smile. “A few more blackbirds, and we should have enough to bake a pie. I’ll save </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="277" height="22" font="2">you their feathers for a hat.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She ought to have known that Brynden Blackfish would be well ahead of her. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“What have the Freys been doing while the Lannisters burn their fields and plunder </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="164" height="22" font="2">their holdfasts?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“There’s been some fighting between Ser Addam’s men and Lord Walder’s,” </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Theon answered. “Not a day’s ride from here, we found two Lannister scouts </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">feeding the crows where the Freys had strung them up. Most of Lord Walder’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">strength remains massed at the Twins, though.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That bore Walder Frey’s seal beyond a doubt, Catelyn thought bitterly; hold </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">back, wait, watch, take no risk unless forced to it. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“If he’s been fighting the Lannisters, perhaps he does mean to hold to his </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="182" height="22" font="2">vows,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Catelyn was less encouraged. “Defending his own lands is one thing, open </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="403" height="22" font="2">battle against Lord Tywin quite another.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb turned back to Theon Greyjoy. “Has the Blackfish found any other way </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">across the Green Fork?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Theon shook his head. “The river’s running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="341" height="22" font="2">can’t be forded, not this far north.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I <i>must</i> have that crossing!” Robb declared, fuming. “Oh, our horses might be </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs. We’d </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don’t </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have the trees for that. <i>Or</i> the time. Lord Tywin is marching north. . .” He balled his </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="155" height="22" font="2">hand into a fist. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,” Theon Greyjoy said with </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his customary easy confidence. “We have five times his numbers. You can take the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="285" height="22" font="2">Twins if you need to, Robb.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Not easily,” Catelyn warned them, “and not in time. While you were </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">the rear.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb glanced from her to Greyjoy, searching for an answer and finding none. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">For a moment he looked even younger than his fifteen years, despite his mail and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sword and the stubble on his cheeks. “What would my lord father do?” he asked </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">her. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">“Find a way across,” she told him. “Whatever it took.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The next morning it was Ser Brynden Tully himself who rode back to them. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He had put aside the heavy plate and helm he’d worn as the Knight of the Gate for </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the lighter leather-and-mail of an outrider, but his obsidian fish still fastened his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">cloak. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Her uncle’s face was grave as he swung down off his horse. “There has been a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">battle under the walls of Riverrun,” he said, his mouth grim. “We had it from a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Lannister outrider we took captive. The Kingslayer has destroyed Edmure’s host </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="484" height="22" font="2">and sent the lords of the Trident reeling in flight.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="583" height="22" font="2">A cold hand clutched at Catelyn’s heart. “And my brother?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Wounded and taken prisoner,” Ser Brynden said. “Lord Blackwood and the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">other survivors are under siege inside Riverrun, surrounded by Jaime’s host.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Robb looked fretful. “We must get across this accursed river if we’re to have </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="354" height="22" font="2">any hope of relieving them in time.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That will not be easily done,” her uncle cautioned. “Lord Frey has pulled his </text>
</page>
<page number="512" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="730" height="22" font="2">whole strength back inside his castles, and his gates are closed and barred.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Damn the man,” Robb swore. “If the old fool does not relent and let me </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cross, he’ll leave me no choice but to storm his walls. I’ll pull the Twins down </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">around his ears if I have to, we’ll see how well he likes that!” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You sound like a sulky boy, Robb,” Catelyn said sharply. “A child sees an </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">obstacle, and his first thought is to run around it or knock it down. A lord must learn </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="583" height="22" font="2">that sometimes words can accomplish what swords cannot.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robb’s neck reddened at the rebuke. “Tell me what you mean, Mother,” he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">said meekly. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Freys have held the crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="461" height="22" font="2">years they have never failed to exact their toll.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="328" height="22" font="2">“What toll? What does he <i>want</i>?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="444" height="22" font="2">She smiled. “That is what we must discover.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="450" height="22" font="2">“And what if I do not choose to pay this toll?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Then you had best retreat back to Moat Cailin, deploy to meet Lord Tywin in </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">battle. . . or grow wings. I see no other choices.” Catelyn put her heels to her horse </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and rode off, leaving her son to ponder her words. It would not do to make him feel </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">as if his mother were usurping his place.  <i>Did you teach him wisdom as well as </i></text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>valor, Ned?</i> she wondered. <i>Did you teach him how to kneel?</i> The graveyards of the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">Seven Kingdoms were full of brave men who had never learned that lesson. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was near midday when their vanguard came in sight of the Twins, where the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">Lords of the Crossing had their seat. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Green Fork ran swift and deep here, but the Freys had spanned it many </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">centuries past and grown rich off the coin men paid them to cross. Their bridge was </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a massive arch of smooth grey rock, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast; </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Water Tower rose from the center of the span, commanding both road and river </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">with its arrow slits, murder holes, and portcullises. It had taken the Freys three </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">generations to complete their bridge; when they were done they’d thrown up stout </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="686" height="22" font="2">timber keeps on either bank, so no one might cross without their leave. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The timber had long since given way to stone. The Twins—two squat, ugly, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">formidable castles, identical in every respect, with the bridge arching between—had </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">guarded the crossing for centuries. High curtain walls, deep moats, and heavy oak-</text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and-iron gates protected the approaches, the bridge footings rose from within stout </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">inner keeps, there was a barbican and portcullis on either bank, and the Water </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="308" height="22" font="2">Tower defended the span itself. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">One glance was sufficient to tell Catelyn that the castle would not be taken by </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">storm. The battlements bristled with spears and swords and scorpions, there was an </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">archer at every crenel and  arrow slit, the drawbridge was up, the portcullis down, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="272" height="22" font="2">the gates closed and barred. </text>
</page>
<page number="513" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Greatjon began to curse and swear as soon as he saw what awaited them. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lord Rickard Karstark glowered in silence. “That cannot be assaulted, my lords,” </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="253" height="22" font="2">Roose Bolton announced. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Nor can we take it by siege, without an army on the far bank to invest the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">other castle,” Helman Tallhart said gloomily. Across the deep-running green waters, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the western twin stood like a reflection of its eastern brother. “Even if we had the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">time. Which, to be sure, we do not.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">As the northern lords studied the castle, a sally port opened, a plank bridge </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">slid across the moat, and a dozen knights rode forth to confront them, led by four of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lord Walder’s many sons. Their banner bore twin towers, dark blue on a field of </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pale silver-grey. Ser Stevron Frey, Lord Walder’s heir, spoke for them. The Freys </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">all looked like weasels; Ser Stevron, past sixty with grandchildren of his own, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">looked like an especially old and tired weasel, yet he was polite enough. “My lord </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="752" height="22" font="2">father has sent me to greet you, and inquire as to who leads this mighty host.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“I do.” Robb spurred his horse forward. He was in his armor, with the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">direwolf shield of Winterfell strapped to his saddle and Grey Wind padding by his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">side. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The old knight looked at her son with a faint flicker of amusement in his </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">watery grey eyes, though his gelding whickered uneasily and sidled away from the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">direwolf. “My lord father would be most honored if you would share meat and </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="584" height="22" font="2">mead with him in the castle and explain your purpose here.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">His words crashed among the lords bannermen like a great stone from a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">catapult. Not one of them approved. They cursed, argued, shouted down each other. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You must not do this, my lord,” Galbart Glover pleaded with Robb. “Lord </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="277" height="22" font="2">Walder is not to be trusted.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Roose Bolton nodded. “Go in there alone and you’re his. He can sell you to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">the Lannisters, throw you in a dungeon, or slit your throat, as he likes.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“If he wants to talk to us, let him open his gates, and we will <i>all</i> share his meat </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="426" height="22" font="2">and mead,” declared Ser Wendel Manderly. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Or let him come out and treat with Robb here, in plain sight of his men and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">ours,” suggested his brother, Ser Wylis. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn Stark shared all their doubts, but she had only to glance at Ser Stevron </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Never more,” Catelyn lied glibly. “Lord Walder is my father’s bannerman. I </text>

<text top="501" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">bastards, and grandbastards, she understood just what he had meant. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lord Walder was ninety, a wizened pink weasel with a bald spotted head, too </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gouty to stand unassisted. His newest wife, a pale frail girl of sixteen years, walked </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">beside his litter when they carried him in. She was the eighth Lady Frey. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord,” Catelyn </text>

<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn had been a girl the last time she had visited the Twins, but even then </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Lord Walder had been irascible, sharp of tongue, and blunt of manner. Age had </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">made him worse than ever, it would seem. She would need to choose her words </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="523" height="22" font="2">with care, and do her best to take no offense from his. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Father,” Ser Stevron said reproachfully, “you forget yourself. Lady Stark is </text>

<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a blanket. When he was settled, the old man beckoned Catelyn forward and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">planted a papery dry kiss on her hand. “There,” he announced. “Now that I have </text>

<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“To ask you to open your gates, my lord,” Catelyn replied politely. “My son </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="788" height="22" font="2">and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river and be on their way.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“To Riverrun?” He sniggered. “Oh, no need to tell me, no need. I’m not blind </text>

<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“To Riverrun,” Catelyn confirmed. She saw no reason to deny it. “Where I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">might have expected to find you, my lord. You are still my father’s bannerman, are </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="100" height="22" font="2">you not?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>Heh</i>,” said Lord Walder, a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt. “I </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the walls. It was my </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">intent to march as soon as all my strength was assembled. Well, to send my sons. I </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">am well past marching myself, Lady Catelyn.” He looked around for likely </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">confirmation and pointed to a tall, stooped man of fifty years. “Tell her, Jared. Tell </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="236" height="22" font="2">her that was my intent.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“It was, my lady,” said Ser Jared  Frey, one of his sons by his second wife. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="161" height="22" font="2">“On my honor.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could march?” </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her, as if challenging her to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dispute his version of events. “I am told the Kingslayer went through him like an </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">axe through ripe cheese. Why should my boys hurry south to die? All those who did </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">go south are running north again.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Catelyn would gladly have spitted the querulous old man and roasted him over </text>

<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“We’re talking now,” Lord Frey complained. The spotted pink head snapped </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">around. “What are you all looking at?” he shouted at his kin. “Get out of here. Lady </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Stark wants to speak to me in private. Might be she has designs on my fidelity, <i>heh</i>. </text>

<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">streamed from the hall, he leaned close to Catelyn and confessed, “They’re all </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">“I have every hope that you will live to be a hundred.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>That </i>would boil them, to be sure. Oh, to be sure. Now, what do you want to </text>

<text top="225" left="108" width="373" height="22" font="2">“We want to cross,” Catelyn told him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="493" height="22" font="2">“Oh, do you? That’s blunt. Why should I let you?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">For a moment her anger flared. “If you were strong enough to climb your own </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">battlements, Lord Frey, you would see that my son has twenty thousand men </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">outside your walls.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They’ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here,” the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">old man shot back. “Don’t you try and frighten me, my lady. Your husband’s in </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">some traitor’s cell under the Red Keep, your father’s sick, might be dying, and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister’s got your brother in chains. What do you have that I should fear? </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">That son of yours? I’ll match you son for son, and I’ll still have eighteen when </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="193" height="22" font="2">yours are all dead.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="564" height="22" font="2">“You swore an oath to my father,” Catelyn reminded him. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He bobbed his head side to side, smiling. “Oh, yes, I said some words, but I </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me. Joffrey’s the king now, and that </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no better than rebels. If I had </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="651" height="22" font="2">the sense the gods gave a fish, I’d help the Lannisters boil you all.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="381" height="22" font="2">“Why don’t you?” she challenged him. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Lord Walder snorted with disdain. “Lord Tywin the proud and splendid, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Warden of the West, Hand of the King, oh, what a great man <i>that</i> one is, him and </text>

<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">many beans, he breaks wind just like me, but you’ll never hear <i>him</i> admit it, oh, no. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">What’s <i>he</i> got to be so puffed up about anyway? Only two sons, and one of them’s </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a twisted little monster. I’ll match <i>him</i> son for son, and I’ll still have nineteen and a </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">That was all Catelyn needed to hear. “I am asking for your help, my lord,” she </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">said humbly. “And my father and my brother and my lord husband and my sons are </text>

<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Lord Walder jabbed a bony finger at her face. “Save your sweet words, my </text>

<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Catelyn frowned, disquieted. “I had understood that Lysa’s boy was to be </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No, it was Lord Stannis,” Walder Frey said irritably. “Do you think I can’t </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Robb galloped out to meet her, with Grey Wind racing beside his stallion. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“It’s done,” she told him. “Lord Walder will grant you your crossing. His swords </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">are yours as well, less four hundred he means to keep back to hold the Twins. I </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">suggest that you leave four hundred of your own, a mixed force of archers and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swordsmen. He can scarcely object to an offer to augment his garrison. . . but make </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">certain you give the command to a man you can trust. Lord Walder may need help </text>

<text top="804" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“As you say, Mother,” Robb answered, gazing at the ranks of pikemen. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="479" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps. . . Ser Helman Tallhart, do you think?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="163" height="22" font="2">“A fine choice.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="344" height="22" font="2">“What. . . what did he want of us?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“If you can spare a few of your swords, I need some men to escort two of </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Lord Frey’s grandsons north to Winterfell,” she told him. “I have agreed to take </text>

<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they are both named Walder. Your brother Bran will welcome the companionship </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="617" height="22" font="2">“Is that all? Two fosterlings? That’s a small enough price to—” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Lord Frey’s son Olyvar will be coming with us,” she went on. “He is to serve </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="788" height="22" font="2">as your personal squire. His father would like to see him knighted, in good time.” </text>
</page>
<page number="519" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="525" height="22" font="2">“A squire.” He shrugged. “Fine, that’s fine, if he’s—” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Also, if your sister Arya is returned to us safely, it is agreed that she will </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">marry Lord Walder’s youngest son, Elmar, when the two of them come of age.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="548" height="22" font="2">Robb looked nonplussed. “Arya won’t like that one bit.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“And you are to wed one of his daughters, once the fighting is done,” she </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">finished. “His lordship has graciously consented to allow you to choose whichever </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="600" height="22" font="2">girl you prefer. He has a number he thinks might be suitable.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="411" height="22" font="2">To his credit, Robb did not flinch. “I see.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="189" height="22" font="2">“Do you consent?” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="155" height="22" font="2">“Can I refuse?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="263" height="22" font="2">“Not if you wish to cross.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I consent,” Robb said solemnly. He had never seemed more manly to her </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">than he did in that moment. Boys might play with swords, but it took a lord to make </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">a marriage pact, knowing what it meant. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river. The double </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">column wound its way through the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">slithering across the courtyard, into the keep and over the bridge, to issue forth once </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="450" height="22" font="2">more from the second castle on the west bank. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with her son and her uncle Ser </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Brynden and Ser Stevron Frey. Behind followed nine tenths of their horse; knights, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">lancers, freeriders, and mounted bowmen. It took hours for them all to cross. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Afterward, Catelyn would remember the clatter of countless hooves on the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">drawbridge, the sight of Lord Walder Frey in his litter watching them pass, the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">glitter of eyes peering down through the slats of the murder holes in the ceiling as </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="351" height="22" font="2">they rode through the Water Tower. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The larger part of the northern host, pikes and archers and great masses of </text>

<text top="235" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>
<text top="262" left="182" width="516" height="22" font="2">re you well, Snow?” Lord Mormont asked, scowling. </text>
<text top="290" left="236" width="356" height="22" font="2">“<i>Well</i>,” his raven squawked. “<i>Well</i>.” </text>
<text top="318" left="236" width="635" height="22" font="2">“I am, my lord,” Jon lied. . . loudly, as if that could make it true. </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">“And you?” </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mormont frowned. “A dead man tried to kill me. How well could I be?” He </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">scratched under his chin. His shaggy grey beard had been singed in the fire, and </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">he’d hacked it off. The pale stubble of his new whiskers made him look old, </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="682" height="22" font="2">disreputable, and grumpy. “You do not look well. How is your hand?” </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Healing.” Jon flexed his bandaged fingers to show him. He had burned </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">himself more badly than he knew throwing the flaming drapes, and his right hand </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was swathed in silk halfway to the elbow. At the time he’d felt nothing; the agony </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had come after. His cracked red skin oozed fluid, and fearsome blood blisters rose </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">between his fingers, big as roaches. “The maester says I’ll have scars, but otherwise </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="439" height="22" font="2">the hand should be as good as it was before.” </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A scarred hand is nothing. On the Wall, you’ll be wearing gloves often as </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="53" height="22" font="2">not.” </text>
<text top="704" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lord.” It was not the thought of scars that troubled Jon; it was </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the rest of it. Maester Aemon had given him milk of the poppy, yet even so, the </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pain had been hideous. At first it had felt as if his hand were still aflame, burning </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">day and night. Only plunging it into basins of snow and shaved ice gave any relief </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at all. Jon thanked the gods that no one but Ghost saw him writhing on his bed, </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whimpering from the pain. And when at last he did sleep, he dreamt, and that was </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">even worse. In the dream, the corpse he fought had blue eyes, black hands, and his </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">father’s face, but he dared not tell Mormont <i>that</i>. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Dywen and Hake returned last night,” the Old Bear said. “They found no </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="472" height="22" font="2">sign of your uncle, no more than the others did.” </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I know.” Jon had dragged himself to the common hall to sup with his friends, </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="759" height="22" font="2">and the failure of the rangers’ search had been all the men had been talking of. </text>
<text top="1035" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You know,” Mormont grumbled. “How is it that everyone knows everything </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">around here?” He did not seem to expect an answer. “It would seem there were only </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">will be more, though. I can feel it in these old bones of mine, and Maester Aemon </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">agrees. The cold winds are rising. Summer is at an end, and a winter is coming such </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="291" height="22" font="2">as this world has never seen.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Winter is coming</i>. The Stark words had never sounded so grim or ominous to </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jon as they did now. “My lord,” he asked hesitantly, “it’s said there was a bird last </text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="247" height="22" font="2">“There was. What of it?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="417" height="22" font="2">“I had hoped for some word of my father.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“<i>Father</i>,” taunted the old raven, bobbing its head as it walked across </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">Mormont’s shoulders. “<i>Father</i>.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Lord Commander reached up to pinch its beak shut, but the raven hopped </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">up on his head, fluttered its wings, and flew across the chamber to light above a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">window. “Grief and noise,” Mormont grumbled. “That’s all they’re good for, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">ravens. Why I put up with that pestilential bird. . . if there was news of Lord </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Eddard, don’t you think I would have sent for you? Bastard or no, you’re still his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">blood. The message concerned Ser Barristan Selmy. It seems he’s been removed </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">from the Kingsguard. They gave his place to that black dog Clegane, and now </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Selmy’s wanted for treason. The fools sent some watchmen to seize him, but he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slew two of them and escaped.” Mormont snorted, leaving no doubt of his view of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">men who’d send gold cloaks against a knight as renowed as Barristan the Bold. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“We have white shadows in the woods and unquiet dead stalking our halls, and a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">boy sits the Iron Throne,” he said in disgust. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">The raven laughed shrilly. “<i>Boy, boy, boy, boy</i>.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Barristan had been the Old Bear’s best hope, Jon remembered; if he had </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fallen, what chance was there that Mormont’s letter would be heeded? He curled his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">hand into a fist. Pain shot through his burned fingers. “What of my sisters?” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The  message made no mention of Lord Eddard or the girls.” He gave an </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">irritated shrug. “Perhaps they never got my letter. Aemon sent two copies, with his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">best birds, but who can say? More like, Pycelle did not deign to reply. It would not </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">be the first time, nor  the last. I fear we count for less than nothing in King’s </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">Landing. They tell us what they want us to know, and that’s little enough.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="4"><i>And you tell  </i>me  <i>what you want</i>  me  <i>to know, and that’s less</i>,  Jon thought </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">resentfully. His brother Robb had called the banners and ridden south to war, yet no </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">word of that had been breathed to him. . . save by Samwell Tarly, who’d read the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">letter to Maester Aemon and whispered its contents to Jon that night in secret, all </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the time saying how he shouldn’t. Doubtless they thought his brother’s war was </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">none of his concern. It troubled him more than he could say. Robb was marching </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and he was not. No matter how often Jon told himself that his place was here now, </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, be quiet,” the Old Bear told it. “Snow, how soon does Maester Aemon </text>

<text top="225" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">black metal scabbard banded with silver. “Here. You’ll be ready for this, then.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The raven flapped down and landed on the table, strutting toward the sword, </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">head cocked curiously. Jon hesitated. He had no inkling what this meant. “My </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="66" height="22" font="2">lord?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The fire melted the silver off the pommel and burnt the crossguard and grip. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Well, dry leather and old wood, what could you expect? The blade, now. . . you’d </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">need a fire a hundred times as hot to harm the blade.” Mormont shoved the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="722" height="22" font="2">scabbard across the rough oak planks. “I had the rest made anew. Take it.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="539" height="22" font="2">“<i>Take it</i>,” echoed his raven, preening. “<i>Take it, take it</i>.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Awkwardly, Jon took the sword in hand. His <i>left</i> hand; his bandaged right was </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">still too raw and clumsy. Carefully he pulled it from its scabbard and raised it level </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">with his eyes. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blade. It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf’s head, with chips of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">metal. Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sometimes named a “bastard sword.” Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and again. “This is Valyrian steel, my lord,” he said wonderingly. His father had let </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="547" height="22" font="2">him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“It is,” the Old Bear told him. “It was my father’s sword, and his father’s </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. I wielded it in my day </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">and passed it on to my son when I took the black.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>He is giving me his son’s sword</i>. Jon could scarcely believe it. The blade was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">exquisitely balanced. The edges glimmered faintly as they kissed the light. “Your </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="74" height="22" font="2">son—” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My son brought dishonor to House Mormont, but at least he had the grace to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leave the sword behind when he fled. My sister returned it to my keeping, but the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">very sight of it reminded me of Jorah’s shame, so I put it aside and thought no more </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of it until we found it in the ashes of my bedchamber. The original pommel was a </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="707" height="22" font="2">thought a white wolf more apt. One of our builders is a fair stonecarver.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When Jon had been Bran’s age, he had dreamed of doing great deeds, as boys </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">always did. The details of his feats changed with every dreaming, but quite often he </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">imagined saving his father’s life. Afterward Lord Eddard would declare that Jon </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had proved himself a true Stark, and place Ice in his hand. Even then he had known </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">it was only a child’s folly; no bastard could ever hope to wield a father’s sword. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Even the memory shamed him. What kind of man stole his own brother’s </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">birthright? <i>I have no right to this, he thought</i>, <i>no more than to Ice</i>. He twitched his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">burned fingers, feeling a throb of pain deep under the skin. “My lord, you honor me, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">but—” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Spare me your  <i>but’s</i>,  boy,” Lord Mormont interrupted. “I would not be </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sitting here were it not for you and that beast of yours. You fought bravely. . . and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">more to the point, you thought quickly.  <i>Fire!</i>  Yes, damn it. We ought to have </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">known. We ought to have <i>remembered</i>. The Long Night has come before. Oh, eight </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">thousand years is a good while, to be sure. . . yet if the Night’s Watch does not </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">remember, who will?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="505" height="22" font="2">“<i>Who will</i>,” chimed the talkative raven. “<i>Who will</i>.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Truly, the gods had heard Jon’s prayer that night; the fire had caught in the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">dead man’s clothing and consumed him as if his flesh were candle wax and his </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bones old dry wood. Jon had only to close his eyes to see the thing staggering </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">across the solar, crashing against the furniture and flailing at the flames. It was the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face that haunted him most; surrounded by a nimbus of fire, hair blazing like straw, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the dead flesh melting away and sloughing off its skull to reveal the gleam of bone </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="87" height="22" font="2">beneath. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Whatever demonic force moved Othor had been driven out by the flames; the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">twisted thing they had found in the ashes had been no more than cooked meat and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">charred bone. Yet in his nightmare he faced it again. . . and this time the burning </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">corpse wore Lord Eddard’s features. It was his father’s skin that burst and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">blackened, his father’s eyes that ran liquid down his cheeks like jellied tears. Jon </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">did not understand why that should be or what it might mean, but it frightened him </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">more than he could say. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A sword’s small payment for a life,” Mormont concluded. “Take it, I’ll hear </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="334" height="22" font="2">no more of it, is that understood?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord.” The soft leather gave beneath Jon’s fingers, as if the sword </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were molding itself to his grip already. He knew he should be honored, and he was, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="112" height="22" font="2">and yet. . .  </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>He is not my father</i>. The thought leapt unbidden to Jon’s mind. <i>Lord Eddard </i></text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>Stark is my father. I will not forget him, no matter how many swords they give me</i>. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man’s sword he dreamt </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="62" height="22" font="2">of. . .  </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I want no courtesies either,” Mormont said, “so thank me no thanks. Honor </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">the steel with deeds, not words.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="442" height="22" font="2">Jon nodded. “Does it have a name, my lord?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="382" height="22" font="2">“It did, once. Longclaw, it was called.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="322" height="22" font="2">“<i>Claw</i>,” the raven cried. “<i>Claw</i>.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Longclaw is an apt name.” Jon tried a practice cut. He was clumsy and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">uncomfortable with his left hand, yet even so the steel seemed to flow through the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="705" height="22" font="2">air, as if it had a will of its own. “Wolves have claws, as much as bears.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear seemed pleased by that. “I suppose they do. You’ll want to wear </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that over the shoulder, I imagine. It’s too long for the hip, at least until you’ve put </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on a few inches. And you’ll need to work at your two-handed strikes as well. Ser </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="654" height="22" font="2">Endrew can show you some moves, when your burns have healed.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="422" height="22" font="2">“Ser Endrew?” Jon did not know the name. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Endrew Tarth, a good man. He’s on his way from the Shadow Tower to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">assume the duties of master-at-arms. Ser Alliser Thorne left yestermorn for </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="482" height="22" font="2">Jon lowered the sword. “Why?” he said, stupidly. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mormont snorted. “Because I <i>sent</i> him, why do you think? He’s bringing the </text>

<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">take ship to King’s Landing and lay it before this boy king. <i>That</i> should get young </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Joffrey’s attention, I’d think. . . and Ser Alliser’s a knight, highborn, anointed, with </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="678" height="22" font="2">old friends at court, altogether harder to ignore than a glorified crow.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="557" height="22" font="2">“<i>Crow</i>.” Jon thought the raven sounded faintly indignant. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“As well,” the Lord Commander continued, ignoring the bird’s protest, “it </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">puts a thousand leagues twixt him and you without it seeming a rebuke.” He jabbed </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a finger up at Jon’s face. “And don’t think this means I approve of that nonsense in </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the common hall. Valor makes up for a fair amount of folly, but you’re not a boy </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">anymore, however many years you’ve seen. That’s a man’s sword you have there, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="754" height="22" font="2">and it will take a man to wield her. I’ll expect you to act the part, henceforth.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord.” Jon slid the sword back into the silver-banded scabbard. If not </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the blade he would have chosen, it was nonetheless a noble gift, and freeing him </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="492" height="22" font="2">from Alliser Thorne’s malignance was nobler still. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear scratched at his chin.  “I had forgotten how much a new beard </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">itches,” he said. “Well, no help for that. Is that hand of yours healed enough to </text>

</page>
<page number="525" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="158" height="22" font="2">“Yes, my lord.” </text>

<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wouldn’t touch it.” He stroked the raven’s head with his thumb, and the bird made a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="603" height="22" font="2">contented <i>quork</i>ing sound. “Away with you. I’ve work to do.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The guards smiled at him from their niches as he wound his way down the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">turret stair, carrying the sword in his good hand. “Sweet steel,” one man said. “You </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">earned that, Snow,” another told him. Jon made himself smile back at them, but his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">heart was not in it. He knew he should be pleased, yet he did not feel it. His hand </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ached, and the taste of anger was in his mouth, though he could not have said who </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="261" height="22" font="2">he was angry with or why. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A half dozen of his friends were lurking outside when he left the King’s </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tower, where Lord Commander Mormont now made his residence. They’d hung a </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">target on the granary doors, so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers, </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but he knew lurkers when he saw them. No sooner did he emerge than Pyp called </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="416" height="22" font="2">out, “Well, come about, let’s have a look.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="205" height="22" font="2">“At what?” Jon said. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="531" height="22" font="2">Toad sidled close. “Your rosy butt cheeks, what else?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="550" height="22" font="2">“The sword,” Grenn stated. “We want to see the sword.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="507" height="22" font="2">Jon raked them with an accusing look. “You knew.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="467" height="22" font="2">Pyp grinned. “We’re not all as dumb as Grenn.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">“You are so,” insisted Grenn. “You’re dumber.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Halder gave an apologetic shrug. “I helped Pate carve the stone for the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">pommel,” the builder said, “and your friend Sam bought the garnets in Mole’s </text>

<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“We knew even before that,  though,” Grenn said. “Rudge has been helping </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Donal Noye in the forge. He was there when the Old Bear brought him the burnt </text>

<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The  <i>sword</i>!” Matt insisted. The others took up the chant. “The  <i>sword</i>,  the </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon unsheathed Longclaw and showed it to them, turning it this way and that </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">so they could admire it. The bastard blade glittered in the pale sunlight, dark and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">deadly. “Valyrian steel,” he declared solemnly, trying to sound as pleased and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="297" height="22" font="2">proud as he ought to have felt. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I heard of a  man who had a razor made of Valyrian steel,” declared Toad. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">“He cut his head off trying to shave.” </text>

<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Jafer Flowers, had also been destroyed, cut near to pieces by a dozen swords. . . but </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">not  before it had slain Ser Jaremy Rykker and four other men. Ser Jaremy had </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">finished the job of hacking its head off, yet had died all the same when the headless </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">corpse pulled his own dagger from its sheath and buried it in his bowels. Strength </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and courage did not avail much against foemen who would not fall because they </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="638" height="22" font="2">were already dead; even arms and armor offered small protection. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">That grim thought soured Jon’s fragile mood. “I need to see Hobb about the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Old Bear’s supper,” he announced brusquely, sliding Longclaw back into its </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scabbard. His friends meant well, but they did not understand. It was not their fault, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">truly; they had not had to face Othor, they had not seen the pale glow of those dead </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blue eyes, had not felt the cold of those dead black fingers. Nor did they know of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the fighting in the riverlands. How could they hope to comprehend? He turned away </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from them abruptly and strode off, sullen. Pyp called after him, but Jon paid him no </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">mind. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They had moved him back to his old cell in tumbledown Hardin’s Tower after </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the fire, and it was there he returned. Ghost was curled up asleep beside the door, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">but he lifted his head at the sound of Jon’s boots. The direwolf’s red eyes were </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">darker than garnets and wiser than men. Jon knelt, scratched his ear, and showed </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">him the pommel of the sword. “Look. It’s you.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ghost sniffed at his carved stone likeness and tried a lick. Jon smiled. “You’re </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the one deserves an honor,” he told the wolf. . . and suddenly he found himself </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">remembering how he’d found him, that day in the late summer snow. They had </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been riding off with the other pups, but Jon had heard a noise and turned back, and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">there he was, white fur almost invisible against the drifts.  <i>He was all alone</i>,  he </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="804" height="22" font="2">thought, <i>apart from the others in the litter. He was different, so they drove him out</i>. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Jon?” He looked up. Samwell Tarly stood rocking nervously on his heels. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">His cheeks were red, and he was wrapped in a heavy fur cloak that made him look </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">ready for hibernation. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="6" height="22" font="2"> </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Sam.” Jon stood. “What is it? Do you want to see the sword?” If the others </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="337" height="22" font="2">had known, no doubt Sam did too. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The fat boy shook his head. “I was heir to my father’s blade once,” he said </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mournfully. “Heartsbane. Lord Randyll let me hold it a few times, but it always </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scared me. It was Valyrian steel, beautiful but so sharp I was afraid I’d hurt one of </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">my sisters. Dickon will have it now.” He wiped sweaty hands on his cloak. “I </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="401" height="22" font="2">ah. . . Maester Aemon wants to see you.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was not time for his bandages to be changed. Jon frowned suspiciously. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Why?” he demanded. Sam looked miserable. That was answer enough. “You told </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">him, didn’t you?” Jon said angrily. “You told him that you told me.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I. . . he. . . Jon, I didn’t want to. . . he asked. . . I mean I think he  <i>knew</i>,  he </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="317" height="22" font="2">sees things no one else sees . . .” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“He’s  <i>blind</i>,” Jon pointed out forcefully, disgusted. “I can find the way </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="637" height="22" font="2">myself.” He left Sam standing there, openmouthed and quivering. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He found Maester Aemon up in the rookery, feeding the ravens. Clydas was </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with him, carrying a bucket of chopped meat as they shuffled from cage to cage. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="278" height="22" font="2">“Sam said you wanted me?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The maester nodded. “I did indeed. Clydas, give Jon the bucket. Perhaps he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">will be kind enough to assist me.” The hunched, pink-eyed brother handed Jon the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">bucket and scurried down the ladder. “Toss the meat into the cages,” Aemon </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="430" height="22" font="2">instructed him. “The birds will do the rest. “ </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jon shifted the bucket to his right hand and thrust his left down into the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bloody bits. The ravens began to scream noisily and fly at the bars, beating at the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">metal with night-black wings. The  meat had been chopped into pieces no larger </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">than a finger joint. He filled his fist and tossed the raw red morsels into the cage, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the squawking and squabbling grew hotter. Feathers flew as two of the larger </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">birds fought over a choice piece. Quickly Jon grabbed a second handful and threw it </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">in after the first. “Lord Mormont’s raven likes fruit and corn.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He is a rare bird,” the maester said. “Most ravens will eat grain, but they </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">prefer flesh. It makes them strong, and I fear they relish the taste of blood. In that </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="578" height="22" font="2">they are like men. . . and like men, not all ravens are alike.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Jon had nothing to say to that. He threw meat, wondering why he’d been </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">summoned. No doubt the old man would tell him, in his own good time. Maester </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">Aemon was not a man to be hurried. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,” the maester went </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">on, “though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to defend itself against hawks. . . yet ravens are black, and they eat the dead, so </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">some godly men abhor them. Baelor the Blessed tried to replace all the ravens with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">doves, did you know?” The maester turned his white eyes on Jon, smiling. “The </text>
</page>
<page number="528" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">Night’s Watch prefers ravens.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon’s fingers were in the bucket, blood up to the wrist. “Dywen says the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">wildlings call us crows,” he said uncertainty. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The crow is the raven’s poor cousin. They are both beggars in black, hated </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">and misunderstood.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon wished he understood what they were talking about, and why. What did </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he care about ravens and doves? If the old man had something to say to him, why </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="223" height="22" font="2">couldn’t he just say it? </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Jon, did you ever wonder <i>why</i> the men of the Night’s Watch take no wives </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">and father no children?” Maester Aemon asked. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon shrugged. “No.” He scattered more meat. The fingers of his left hand were </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of the bucket. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“So they will not love,” the old man answered, “for love is the bane of honor, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">the death of duty.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">That did not sound right to Jon, yet he said nothing. The maester was a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hundred years old, and a high officer of the Night’s Watch; it was not his place to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">contradict him. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The old man seemed to sense his doubts. “Tell me, Jon, if the day should ever </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">come when your lord father must needs choose between honor on the one hand and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="467" height="22" font="2">those he loves on the other, what would he do?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Jon hesitated. He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">himself, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered,  <i>He fathered a </i></text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what of his duty to her, he </i></text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="831" height="22" font="4"><i>will not even say her name</i>.  “He would do whatever was right,” he </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">said. . . ringingly, to make up for his hesitation. “No matter what.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand. Most of us are not so strong. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">What is honor compared to a woman’s love? What is duty against the feel of a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">newborn son in your arms. . . or the memory of a brother’s smile? Wind and words. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">is our great glory, and our great tragedy. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“The men who formed the Night’s Watch knew that only their courage </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shielded the realm from the darkness to the north. They knew they must have no </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">divided loyalties to weaken their resolve. So they vowed they would have no wives </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">nor children. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Yet brothers they had, and sisters. Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">gave them names. They came from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knew times may change, but men do not. So they pledged as well that the Night’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="622" height="22" font="2">Watch would take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded. </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">swords to hand. He did not march. In the days when the Seven Kingdoms  <i>were</i> </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The Watch took no part. When the Andals crossed the narrow sea and swept away </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the kingdoms of the First Men, the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and remained at their posts. So it has always been, for years beyond counting. Such </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">is the price of honor. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear. And we </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">all do our duty, when there is no cost to it. How easy it seems then, to walk the path </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of honor. Yet soon or late in every man’s life comes a day when it is <i>not</i> easy, a day </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Some of the ravens were still eating, long stringy bits of meat dangling from </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">their beaks. The rest seemed to be watching him. Jon could feel the weight of all </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">those tiny black eyes. “And this is my day. . . is that what you’re saying?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon turned his head and <i>looked</i> at him with those dead white eyes. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">It was as if he were seeing right into his heart. Jon felt naked and exposed. He took </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the bucket in both hands and flung the rest of the slops through the bars. Strings of </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">meat and blood flew everywhere, scattering the ravens. They took to the air, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shrieking wildly. The quicker birds snatched morsels on the wing and gulped them </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="567" height="22" font="2">down greedily. Jon let the empty bucket clang to the floor. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The old man laid a withered, spotted hand on his shoulder. “It hurts, boy,” he </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="775" height="22" font="2">said softly. “Oh, yes. Choosing. . . it has always hurt. And always will. I know.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You <i>don’t</i> know,” Jon said bitterly. “No one knows. Even if I am his bastard, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">he’s still my <i>father</i> . . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Maester Aemon sighed. “Have you heard nothing I’ve told you, Jon? Do you </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">think you are the first?” He shook his ancient head, a gesture weary beyond words. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Three times the gods saw fit to test my vows. Once when I was a boy, once in the </text>

<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fled, my eyes grown dim, yet that last choice was as cruel as the first. My ravens </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would bring the news from the south, words darker than their wings, the ruin of my </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">House, the death of my kin, disgrace and desolation. What could I have done, old, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blind, frail? I was helpless as a suckling babe, yet still it grieved me to sit forgotten </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Jon was shocked to see the shine of tears in the old man’s eyes. “Who are </text>

<text top="814" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">different with the townsfolk. Dany pitied them; she remembered what terror felt </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah lifted the visor of his flat-topped greathelm as he rode up. “Your </text>

<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">were put aside. It was different out in the grass. Ogo’s <i>khalasar</i> had been attacking </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the town when Khal Drogo caught him. She wondered what the Lamb Men had </text>

<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">walls. Perhaps a few, the younger and more foolish who still believed that the gods </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending sound, a long sobbing </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wail that went on and on and on. Dany’s hand clenched hard around the reins, and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="726" height="22" font="2">she turned the silver’s head. “Make them stop,” she commanded Ser Jorah. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="425" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>?” The knight sounded perplexed. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You heard my words,” she said. “Stop them.” She spoke to her  <i>khas</i>  in the </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="2">harsh accents of Dothraki. “Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah. I want no rape.” </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Across the road, the girl was still crying, her high singsong tongue strange to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Dany’s ears. The first man was done with her now, and  a second had taken his </text>

<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“She is a lamb girl,” Quaro said in Dothraki. “She is nothing,  <i>Khaleesi</i>.  The </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="630" height="22" font="2">riders do her honor. The Lamb Men lay with sheep, it is known.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="395" height="22" font="2">“It is known,” her handmaid Irri echoed. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It is known,” agreed Jhogo, astride the tall grey stallion that Drogo had given </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him. “If her wailing offends your ears, <i>Khaleesi</i>, Jhogo will bring you her tongue.” </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">He drew his <i>arakh</i>. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I will not have her harmed,” Dany said. “I claim her. Do as I command you, </text>

<text top="777" left="108" width="771" height="22" font="2">“<i>Ai, Khaleesi</i>,” Jhogo replied, kicking his horse. Quaro and the others </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="473" height="22" font="2">followed his lead, the bells in their hair chiming. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="428" height="22" font="2">“Go with them,” she commanded Ser Jorah. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“As you command.” The knight gave her a curious look. “You are your </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="344" height="22" font="2">“Viserys?” She did not understand. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="470" height="22" font="2">“No,” he answered. “Rhaegar.” He galloped off. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany heard Jhogo shout. The rapers laughed at him. One man shouted back. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Jhogo’s  <i>arakh</i>  flashed, and the man’s head went tumbling from his shoulders. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Laughter turned to curses as the horsemen reached for weapons, but by then Quaro </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and Aggo and Rakharo were there. She saw Aggo point across the road to where </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">she sat upon her silver. The riders looked at her with cold black eyes. One spat. The </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah dismounted and wrenched him off with a mailed hand. The Dothraki went </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sprawling in the mud, bounced up with a knife in hand, and died with Aggo’s arrow </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">through his throat. Mormont pulled the girl off the pile of corpses and wrapped her </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in his blood-spattered cloak. He led her across the road to Dany. “What do you want </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">done with her?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The girl was trembling, her eyes wide and vague. Her hair was matted with </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blood. “Doreah, see to her hurts. You do not have a rider’s look, perhaps she will </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not fear you. The rest, with me.” She urged the silver through the broken wooden </text>

<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was worse inside the town. Many of the houses were afire, and the  <i>jaqqa </i></text>

<text top="446" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="4"><i>khas</i>  to make an end to it, and claimed the victim as slave. One of them, a thick-</text>

<text top="528" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">her, she realized with sadness; afraid that she had saved them for some worse fate. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“You cannot claim them all, child,” Ser Jorah said, the fourth time they </text>

<text top="694" left="54" width="375" height="22" font="2">and the wailing of frightened children. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">They found Khal Drogo seated before a square windowless temple with thick </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mud walls and a bulbous dome like some immense brown onion. Beside him was a </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">pile of heads taller than he was. One of the short arrows of the Lamb Men stuck </text>

<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jhiqui helped Dany dismount; she had grown clumsy as her belly grew larger </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stream of angry Dothraki too fast for Dany to understand. The huge bloodrider gave </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her a heavy look before he turned to his <i>khal</i> “This one is Mago, who rides in the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>khas</i> of Ko Jhaqo. He says the <i>khaleesi</i> has taken his spoils, a daughter of the lambs </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="233" height="22" font="2">who was his to mount.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo’s face was still and hard, but his black eyes were curious as they </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">went to Dany. “Tell me the truth of this, moon of my life,” he commanded in </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">Dothraki. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany told him what she had done, in his own tongue so the  <i>khal</i>  would </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">understand her better, her words simple and direct. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When she was done, Drogo was frowning. “This is the way of war. These </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="514" height="22" font="2">women are our slaves now, to do with as we please.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It pleases me to hold them safe,” Dany said, wondering if she had dared too </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">much. “If your warriors would mount these women, let them take them gently and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="809" height="22" font="2">keep them for wives. Give them places in the <i>khalasar</i> and let them bear you sons.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Qotho was ever the cruelest of the bloodriders. It was he who laughed. “Does </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="318" height="22" font="2">the horse breed with the sheep?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Something in his tone reminded her of Viserys. Dany turned on him angrily. </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="442" height="22" font="2">“The dragon feeds on horse and sheep alike.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo smiled. “See how fierce she grows!” he said. “It is my son inside </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">her, the stallion who mounts the world, filling her with his fire. Ride slowly, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Qotho. . . if the mother does not burn you where you sit, the son will trample you </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into the mud. And you, Mago, hold your tongue and find another lamb to mount. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">These belong to my <i>khaleesi</i>.” He started to reach out a hand to Daenerys, but as he </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="642" height="22" font="2">lifted his arm Drogo grimaced in sudden pain and turned his head. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany could almost feel his agony. The wounds were worse than Ser Jorah had </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">led her to believe. “Where are the healers?” she demanded. The <i>khalasar</i> had two </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sorts: barren women and eunuch slaves. The herbwomen dealt in potions and spells, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="712" height="22" font="2">the eunuchs in knife, needle, and fire. “Why do they not attend the <i>khal</i>?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The  <i>khal</i>  sent the hairless men away,  <i>Khaleesi</i>,” old Cohollo assured her. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Dany saw the bloodrider had taken a wound himself; a deep gash in his left </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">shoulder. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Many riders are hurt,” Khal Drogo said stubbornly. “Let them be healed first. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">This arrow is no more than the bite of a fly, this little cut only a new scar to boast of </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">to my son.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany could see the muscles in his chest where the skin had been cut away. A </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">trickle of blood ran from the arrow that pierced his arm. “It is not for Khal Drogo to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">wait,” she proclaimed. “Jhogo, seek out these eunuchs and bring them here at </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">once.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Silver Lady,” a woman’s voice said behind her, “I can help the Great Rider </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany turned her head. The speaker was one of the slaves she had claimed, the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">heavy, flat-nosed woman who had blessed her. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“The  <i>khal</i>  needs no help from women who lie with sheep,” barked Qotho. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">“Aggo, cut out her tongue.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="542" height="22" font="2">Aggo grabbed her hair and pressed a knife to her throat. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="518" height="22" font="2">Dany lifted a hand. “No. She is mine. Let her speak.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">Aggo looked from her to Qotho. He lowered his knife. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I meant no wrong, fierce riders.” The woman spoke Dothraki well. The robes </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">she wore had once been the lightest and finest of woolens, rich with embroidery, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">but now they were mud-caked and bloody and ripped. She clutched the torn cloth of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="742" height="22" font="2">her bodice to her heavy breasts. “I have some small skill in the healing arts.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="323" height="22" font="2">“Who are you?” Dany asked her. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="594" height="22" font="2">“I am named Mirri Maz Duur. I am godswife of this temple.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“<i>Maegi</i>,” grunted Haggo, fingering his  <i>arakh</i>.  His look was dark. Dany </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remembered the word from a terrifying story that Jhiqui had told her one night by </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the cookfire. A  <i>maegi</i>  was a woman who lay with demons and practiced the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">blackest of sorceries, a vile thing, evil and soulless, who came to men in the dark of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="508" height="22" font="2">night and sucked life and strength from their bodies. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="369" height="22" font="2">“I am a healer,” Mirri Maz Duur said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“A healer of sheeps,” sneered Qotho. “Blood of my blood, I say kill this </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="4"><i>maegi</i> and wait for the hairless men.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany ignored the bloodrider’s outburst. This old, homely, thickbodied woman </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">did not look like a  <i>maegi</i>  to her. “Where did you learn your healing, Mirri Maz </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">Duur?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“My mother was godswife before me, and taught me all the songs and spells </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">most pleasing to the Great Shepherd, and how to make the sacred smokes and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ointments from leaf and root and berry. When I was younger and more fair, I went </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in caravan to Asshai by the Shadow, to learn from their mages. Ships from many </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">lands come to Asshai, so I lingered long to study the healing ways of distant </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">peoples. A moonsinger of the Jogos Nhai gifted me with her birthing songs, a </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">woman of your own riding people taught me the magics of grass and corn and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">horse, and a maester from the Sunset Lands opened a body for me and showed me </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">all the secrets that hide beneath the skin.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="427" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah Mormont spoke up. “A maester?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Marwyn, he named himself,” the woman replied in the Common Tongue. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“From the sea. Beyond the sea. The Seven Lands, he said. Sunset Lands. Where </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="563" height="22" font="2">men are iron and dragons rule. He taught me this speech.” </text>

<page number="537" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A maester in Asshai,” Ser Jorah mused. “Tell me, Godswife, what did this </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“A chain so tight it was like to choke him, Iron Lord, with links of many </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">metals.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The knight looked at Dany. “Only a man trained in the Citadel of Oldtown </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="699" height="22" font="2">wears such a chain,” he said, “and such men do know much of healing.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="405" height="22" font="2">“Why should you want to help my <i>khal</i>?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“All men are one flock, or so we are taught,” replied Mirri Maz Duur. “The </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="775" height="22" font="2">Great Shepherd sent me to earth to heal his lambs, wherever I might find them.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="568" height="22" font="2">Qotho gave her a stinging slap. “We are no sheep, <i>maegi</i>.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="690" height="22" font="2">“Stop it,” Dany said angrily. “She is mine. I will not have her harmed.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="557" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo grunted. “The arrow must come out, Qotho.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Yes, Great Rider,” Mirri Maz Duur answered, touching her  bruised face. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">“And your breast must be washed and sewn, lest the wound fester.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="385" height="22" font="2">“Do it, then,” Khal Drogo commanded. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Great Rider,” the woman said, “my tools and potions are inside the god’s </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="465" height="22" font="2">house, where the healing powers are strongest.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="523" height="22" font="2">“I will carry you, blood of my blood,” Haggo offered. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo waved him away. “I need no man’s help,” he said, in a voice </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">proud and hard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all. A fresh wave of blood </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ran down his breast, from where Ogo’s <i>arakh</i> had cut off his nipple. Dany moved </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">quickly to his side. “I am no man,” she whispered, “so you may lean on me.” Drogo </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">put a huge hand on her shoulder. She took some of his weight as they walked </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">toward the great mud temple. The three bloodriders followed. Dany commanded </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah  and the warriors of her  <i>khas</i>  to guard the entrance and make certain no </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="515" height="22" font="2">one set the building afire while they were still inside. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">They passed through a series of anterooms, into the high central chamber </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">under the onion. Faint light shone down through hidden  windows above. A few </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">torches burnt smokily from sconces on the walls. Sheepskins were scattered across </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">the mud floor. “There,” Mirri Maz Duur said, pointing to the altar, a massive blue-</text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">veined stone carved with images of shepherds and their flocks. Khal Drogo lay </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">upon it. The old woman threw a handful of dried leaves onto a brazier, filling the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="798" height="22" font="2">chamber with fragrant smoke. “Best if you wait outside,” she told the rest of them. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="579" height="22" font="2">“We are blood of his blood,” Cohollo said. “Here we wait.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Qotho stepped close to Mirri Maz Duur. “Know this, wife of the Lamb God. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Harm the  <i>khal</i>  and you suffer the same.” He drew his skinning knife and showed </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">her the blade. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“She will do no harm.” Dany felt she could trust this old, plainfaced woman </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">with her flat nose; she had saved her from the hard hands of her rapers, after all. </text>

<page number="538" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If you must stay, then help,” Mirri told the bloodriders. “The Great Rider is </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">too strong for me. Hold him still while I draw the arrow from his flesh.” She let the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rags of her gown fall to her waist as she opened a carved chest, and busied herself </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with bottles and boxes, knives and needles. When she was ready, she broke off the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">barbed arrowhead and pulled out the shaft, chanting in the singsong tongue of the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lhazareen. She heated a flagon of wine to boiling on the brazier, and poured it over </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his wounds. Khal Drogo cursed her, but he did not move. She bound the arrow </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wound with a plaster of wet leaves and turned to the gash on his breast, smearing it </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with a pale green paste before she pulled the flap of skin back in place. The  <i>khal</i> </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ground his teeth together and swallowed a scream. The godswife took out a silver </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">needle and a bobbin of silk thread and began to close the flesh. When she was done </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she painted the skin with red ointment, covered it with more leaves, and bound the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">breast in a ragged piece of lambskin. “You must say the prayers I give you and keep </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the lambskin in place for ten days and ten nights,” she said. “There will be fever, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="537" height="22" font="2">and itching, and a great scar when the healing is done.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo sat, bells ringing. “I sing of my scars, sheep woman.” He flexed </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">his arm and scowled. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Drink neither wine nor the milk of the poppy,” she cautioned him. “Pain you </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">will have, but you must keep your body strong to fight the poison spirits.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I am <i>khal</i>,” Drogo said. “I spit on pain and drink what I like. Cohollo, bring </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="374" height="22" font="2">my vest.” The older man hastened off. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Before,” Dany said to the ugly Lhazareen woman, “I heard you speak of </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="183" height="22" font="2">birthing songs. . .” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I know every secret of the bloody bed, Silver Lady, nor have I ever lost a </text>

<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My time is near,” Dany said. “I would have you attend me when he comes, if </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="125" height="22" font="2">you would.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo laughed. “Moon of my life, you do not ask a slave, you tell her. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She will do as you command.” He jumped down from the altar. “Come, my blood. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">The stallions call, this place is ashes. It is time to ride.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Haggo followed the <i>khal</i> from the temple, but Qotho lingered long enough to </text>

<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“As you say,  rider,” the woman answered him, gathering up her jars and </text>

<text top="290" left="132" width="744" height="22" font="2">had been erected beneath an elm tree and covered with a golden cloth. </text>
<text top="318" left="132" width="739" height="22" font="2">There, beside his pavilion, Lord Tywin took his evening meal with his chief </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knights and lords bannermen, his great crimson-and-gold standard waving overhead </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="174" height="22" font="2">from a lofty pike. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Tyrion arrived late, saddlesore, and sour, all too vividly aware of how </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">amusing he must look as he waddled up the slope to his father. The day’s march had </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been long and tiring. He thought he might get quite drunk tonight. It was twilight, </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="417" height="22" font="2">and the air was alive with drifting fireflies. </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The cooks were serving the meat course: five suckling pigs, skin seared and </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crackling, a different fruit in every mouth. The smell made his mouth water. “My </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">pardons,” he began, taking his place on the bench beside his uncle. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps I’d best charge you with burying our dead, Tyrion,” Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">said. “If you are as late to battle as you are to table, the fighting will all be done by </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">the time you arrive.” </text>
<text top="676" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, surely you can save me a peasant or two, Father,” Tyrion replied. “Not </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">too many, I wouldn’t want to be greedy.” He filled his wine cup and watched a </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">serving man carve into the pig. The crisp skin crackled under his knife, and hot </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="715" height="22" font="2">juice ran from the meat. It was the loveliest sight Tyrion had seen in ages. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Ser Addam’s outriders say the Stark host has moved south from the Twins,” </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his father reported as his trencher was filled with slices of pork. “Lord Frey’s levies </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">have joined them. They are likely no more than a day’s march north of us.” </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="476" height="22" font="2">“Please, Father,” Tyrion said. “I’m about to eat.” </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Does the thought of facing the Stark boy unman you, Tyrion? Your brother </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">Jaime would be eager to come to grips with him.” </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I’d sooner come to grips with that pig. Robb Stark is not half so tender, and </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="265" height="22" font="2">he never smelled as good.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Lord Lefford, the sour bird who had charge of their stores and supplies, leaned </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">forward. “I hope your savages do not share your reluctance, else we’ve wasted our </text>

<text top="1090" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“My savages will put your steel to excellent use, my lord,” Tyrion replied. </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">When he had told Lefford he needed arms and armor to equip the  three hundred </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">men Ulf had fetched down out of the foothills, you would have thought he’d asked </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="564" height="22" font="2">the man to turn his virgin daughters over to their pleasure. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lord Lefford frowned. “I saw that great hairy one today, the one who insisted </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that he must have  <i>two</i>  battle-axes, the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">blades.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Shagga likes to kill with either hand,” Tyrion said as a trencher of steaming </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="288" height="22" font="2">pork was laid in front of him. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="544" height="22" font="2">“He still had that wood-axe of his strapped to his back.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Shagga is of the opinion that three axes are even better than two.” Tyrion </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">reached a thumb and forefinger into the salt dish, and sprinkled a healthy pinch over </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">his meat. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan leaned forward. “We had a thought to put you and your wildlings </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="406" height="22" font="2">in the vanguard when we come to battle.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan seldom “had a thought” that Lord Tywin had not had first. Tyrion </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">had skewered a chunk of meat on the point of his dagger and brought it to his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mouth. Now he lowered it. “The vanguard?” he repeated dubiously. Either his lord </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father had a new respect for Tyrion’s abilities, or he’d decided to rid himself of his </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="720" height="22" font="2">embarrassing get for good. Tyrion had the gloomy feeling he knew which. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="467" height="22" font="2">“They seem ferocious enough,” Ser Kevan said. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ferocious?” Tyrion realized he was echoing his uncle like a trained bird. His </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father watched, judging him, weighing every word. “Let me tell you how ferocious </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they are. Last night, a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. So today </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">as we made camp three Stone Crows seized the man and opened his throat for him. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Perhaps they were hoping to get the sausage back, I couldn’t say. Bronn managed to </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man’s cock, which was fortunate, but even </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="725" height="22" font="2">so Ulf is demanding blood money, which Conn and Shagga refuse to pay.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their lord commander,” his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">father said. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His brother Jaime had always been able to make men follow him eagerly, and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">die for him if need be. Tyrion lacked that gift. He bought loyalty with gold, and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">compelled obedience with his name. “A <i>bigger</i> man would be able to put the fear in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="422" height="22" font="2">them, is that what you’re saying, my lord?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin Lannister turned to his brother. “If my son’s men will not obey </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his commands, perhaps the vanguard is not the place for him. No doubt he would be </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="568" height="22" font="2">more comfortable in the rear, guarding our baggage train.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Do me no kindnesses, Father,” he said angrily. “If you have no other </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">command to offer me, I’ll lead your van.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin studied his dwarf son. “I said nothing about command. You will </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion took one bite of pork, chewed a moment, and spit it out angrily. “I find </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I am not hungry after all,” he said, climbing awkwardly off the bench. “Pray excuse </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">me, my lords.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin inclined his head, dismissing him. Tyrion turned and walked </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">away. He was conscious of their eyes on his back as he waddled down the hill. A </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">great gust of laughter went up from behind him, but he did not look back. He hoped </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="372" height="22" font="2">they all choked on their suckling pigs. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dusk had settled, turning all the banners black. The Lannister camp sprawled </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">for miles between the river and the kingsroad. In amongst the men and the horses </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and the trees, it was easy to get lost, and Tyrion did. He passed a dozen great </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="827" height="22" font="2">pavilions and a hundred cookfires. Fireflies drifted amongst the tents like </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">wandering stars. He caught the scent of garlic sausage, spiced and savory, so </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tempting it made his empty stomach growl. Away in the distance, he heard voices </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">raised in some bawdy song. A giggling woman raced past him, naked beneath a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dark cloak, her drunken pursuer stumbling over tree roots. Farther on, two spearmen </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">faced each other across a little trickle of a stream, practicing their thrust-and-parry </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">in the fading light, their chests bare and slick with sweat. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">No one looked at him. No one spoke to him. No one paid him any mind. He </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">was surrounded by men sworn to House Lannister, a vast host twenty thousand </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">strong, and yet he was alone. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When he heard the deep rumble of Shagga’s laughter booming through the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dark, he followed it to the Stone Crows in their small corner of the night. Conn son </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of Coratt waved a tankard of ale. “Tyrion Halfman! Come, sit by our fire, share </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="438" height="22" font="2">meat with the Stone Crows. We have an ox.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I can see that, Conn son of Coratt.” The huge red carcass was suspended over </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a roaring fire, skewered on a spit the size of a small tree. No doubt it was a small </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tree. Blood and grease dripped down into the flames as two Stone Crows turned the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">meat. “I thank you. Send for me when the ox is cooked.” From the look of it, that </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">might even be before the battle. He walked on. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Each clan had its own cookfire; Black Ears did not eat with Stone Crows, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Stone Crows did not eat with Moon Brothers, and no one ate with Burned Men. The </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">modest tent he had coaxed out of Lord Lefford’s stores had been erected in the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">center of the four fires. Tyrion found Bronn sharing a skin of wine with the new </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">servants. Lord Tywin had sent him a groom and a body servant to see to his needs, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and even insisted he take a squire. They were seated around the embers of a small </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">cookfire. A girl was with them; slim, dark-haired, no more than eighteen by the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">look of her. Tyrion studied her face for a moment, before he spied fishbones in the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="266" height="22" font="2">ashes. “What did you eat?” </text>
</page>
<page number="542" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="535" height="22" font="2">“Trout, m’lord,” said his groom. “Bronn caught them.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Trout</i>, he thought. <i>Suckling pig. Damn my father</i>. He stared mournfully at the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="256" height="22" font="2">bones, his belly rumbling. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">His squire, a boy with the unfortunate name of Podrick Payne, swallowed </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whatever he had been about to say. The lad was a distant cousin to Ser Ilyn Payne, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the king’s headsman. . . and almost as quiet, although not for want of a tongue. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion had made him stick it out once, just to be certain. “Definitely a tongue,” he </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">had said. “Someday you must learn to use it.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">At the moment, he did not have the patience to try and coax a thought out of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the lad, whom he suspected had been inflicted on him as a cruel jape. Tyrion turned </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="575" height="22" font="2">his attention back to the girl. “Is this her?” he asked Bronn. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She rose gracefully and looked down at him from the lofty height of five feet </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="678" height="22" font="2">or more. “It is, m’lord, and she can speak for herself, if it please you.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He cocked his head to one side. “I am Tyrion, of House Lannister. Men call </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="132" height="22" font="2">me the Imp.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="516" height="22" font="2">“My mother named me Shae. Men call me. . . often.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bronn laughed, and Tyrion had to smile. “Into the tent, Shae, if you would be </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="765" height="22" font="2">so kind.” He lifted the flap and held it for her. Inside, he knelt to light a candle. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The life of a soldier was not without certain compensations. Wherever you </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have a camp, you are certain to have camp followers. At the end of the day’s march, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion had sent Bronn back to find him a likely whore. “I would prefer one who is </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">reasonably young, with as pretty a face as you can find,” he had said. “If she has </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">washed sometime this year, I shall be glad. If she hasn’t, wash her. Be certain that </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">you tell her who I am, and warn her of <i>what</i> I am.” Jyck had not always troubled to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">do that. There was a look the girls got in their eyes sometimes when they first </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">beheld the lordling they’d been hired to pleasure. . . a took that Tyrion Lannister did </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">not ever care to see again. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He lifted the candle and looked her over. Bronn had done well enough; she </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was doe-eyed and slim, with small firm breasts and a smile that was by turns shy, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="805" height="22" font="2">insolent, and wicked. He liked that. “Shall I take my gown off, m’lord?” she asked. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="403" height="22" font="2">“In good time. Are you a maiden, Shae?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">“If it please you, m’lord,” she said demurely. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="547" height="22" font="2">“What would please me would be the truth of you, girl.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="359" height="22" font="2">“Aye, but that will cost you double.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion decided they would get along splendidly. “I am a Lannister. Gold I </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">have in plenty, and you’ll find me generous . . . but I’ll want more from you than </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">what you’ve got between your legs, though I’ll want that too. You’ll share my tent, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pour my wine, laugh at my jests, rub the ache from my legs after each day’s </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ride. . . and whether I keep you a day or a year, for so long as we are together you </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">will take no other men into your bed.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Fair enough.” She reached down to the hem of her thin roughspun gown and </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">pulled it up over her head in one smooth motion, tossing it aside. There was nothing </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">underneath but Shae. “If he don’t put down that candle, m’lord will burn his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">fingers.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion put down the candle, took her hand in his, and pulled her gently to </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">him. She bent to kiss him. Her mouth tasted of honey and cloves, and her fingers </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="644" height="22" font="2">were deft and practiced as they found the fastenings of his clothes. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">When he entered her, she welcomed him with whispered endearments and </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">small, shuddering gasps of pleasure. Tyrion suspected her delight was feigned, but </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">she did it so well that it did not matter. <i>That</i> much truth he did not crave. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He had needed her, Tyrion realized afterward, as she lay quietly in his arms. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Her or someone like her. It had been nigh on a year since he’d lain with a woman, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">since before he had set out for Winterfell in company with his brother and King </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Robert. He could well die on the morrow or the day after, and if he did, he would </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sooner go to his grave thinking of Shae than of his lord father, Lysa Arryn, or the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="199" height="22" font="2">Lady Catelyn Stark. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He could feel the softness of  her breasts pressed against his arm as she lay </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">beside him. That was a good feeling. A song filled his head. Softly, quietly, he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="169" height="22" font="2">began to whistle. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="509" height="22" font="2">“What’s that, m’lord?” Shae murmured against him. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Nothing,” he told her. “A song I learned as a boy, that’s all. Go to sleep, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">sweetling.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When her eyes were closed and her breathing deep and steady, Tyrion slid out </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from beneath her, gently, so as not to disturb her sleep. Naked, he crawled outside, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">stepped over his squire, and walked around behind his tent to make water. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bronn was seated cross-legged under a chestnut tree, near where they’d tied </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the horses. He was honing the edge of his sword, wide awake; the sellsword did not </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seem to sleep like other men. “Where did you find her?” Tyrion asked him as he </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="72" height="22" font="2">pissed. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I took her from a knight. The man was loath to give her up, but your name </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="645" height="22" font="2">changed his thinking somewhat. . . that, and my dirk at his throat.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Splendid,” Tyrion said dryly, shaking off the last drops. “I seem to recall </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">saying <i>find me a whore</i>, not <i>make me an enemy</i>.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The pretty ones were all claimed,” Bronn said. “I’ll be pleased to take her </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="370" height="22" font="2">back if you’d prefer a toothless drab.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Tyrion limped closer to where he sat. “My lord father would call that </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">insolence, and send you to the mines for impertinence.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Good for me you’re not your father,” Bronn replied. “I saw one with boils all </text>

<page number="544" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="354" height="22" font="2">over her nose. Would you like her?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What, and break your heart?” Tyrion shot back. “I shall keep Shae. Did you </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">perchance note the <i>name</i> of this knight you took her from? I’d rather not have him </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">beside me in the battle.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bronn rose, cat-quick and cat-graceful, turning his sword in his hand. “You’ll </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="400" height="22" font="2">have me beside you in the battle, dwarf.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion nodded. The night air was warm on his bare skin. “See that I survive </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">this battle, and you can name your reward.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bronn tossed the longsword from his right hand to his left, and tried a cut. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="374" height="22" font="2">“Who’d want to kill the likes of you?” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="484" height="22" font="2">“My lord father, for one. He’s put me in the van.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="751" height="22" font="2">“I’d do the same. A small man with a big shield. You’ll give the archers fits.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="569" height="22" font="2">“I find you oddly cheering,” Tyrion said. “I must be mad.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="446" height="22" font="2">Bronn sheathed his sword. “Beyond a doubt.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When Tyrion returned to his tent, Shae rolled onto her elbow and murmured </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="394" height="22" font="2">sleepily, “I woke and m’lord was gone.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="2">“M’lord is back now.” He slid in beside her. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her hand went between his stunted legs, and found him hard. “Yes he is,” she </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">whispered, stroking him. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He asked her about the man Bronn had taken her from, and she named the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">minor retainer of an insignificant lordling. “You need not fear his like, m’lord,” the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="571" height="22" font="2">girl said, her fingers busy at his cock. “He is a small man.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“And what am I, pray?” Tyrion asked her. “A giant?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Oh, yes,” she purred, “my giant of Lannister.” She mounted him then, and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="733" height="22" font="2">for a time, she almost made him believe it. Tyrion went to sleep smiling. . .  </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">. . . and woke in darkness to the blare of trumpets. Shae was shaking him by </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">the shoulder. “M’lord,” she whispered. “Wake up, m’lord. I’m frightened.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Groggy, he sat up and threw back the blanket. The horns called through the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">night, wild and urgent, a cry that said <i>hurry hurry hurry</i>. He heard shouts, the clatter </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of spears, the whicker of horses, though nothing yet that spoke to him of fighting. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“My lord father’s trumpets,” he said. “Battle assembly. I thought Stark was yet a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="197" height="22" font="2">day’s march away.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="559" height="22" font="2">Shae shook her head, lost. Her eyes were wide and white. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Groaning, Tyrion lurched to his feet and pushed his way outside, shouting for </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">his squire. Wisps of pale fog drifted through the night, long white fingers off the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">river. Men and horses blundered through the predawn chill; saddles were being </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">cinched, wagons loaded, fires extinguished. The trumpets blew again: <i>hurry hurry </i></text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="4"><i>hurry</i>.  Knights vaulted onto snorting coursers while men-at-arms buckled their </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sword belts as they ran. When he found Pod, the boy was snoring softly. Tyrion </text>

<page number="545" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gave him a sharp poke in the ribs with his toe. “My armor,” he said, “and be quick </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">about it.” Bronn came trotting out of the mists, already armored and ahorse, </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wearing his battered halfhelm. “Do you know what’s happened?” Tyrion asked him. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“The Stark boy stole a march on us,” Bronn said. “He crept down the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">kingsroad in the night, and now his host is less than a mile north of here, forming up </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">in battle array.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="449" height="22" font="4"><i>Hurry</i>, the trumpets called, <i>hurry hurry hurry</i>. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“See that the clansmen are ready to ride.” Tyrion ducked back inside his tent. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Where are my clothes?” he barked at Shae. “There. No, the leather, damn it. Yes. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">Bring me my boots.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">By the time he was dressed, his squire had laid out his armor, such that it was. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion owned a fine suit of heavy plate, expertly crafted to fit his misshapen body. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Alas, it was safe at Casterly Rock, and he was not. He had to make do with </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">oddments assembled from Lord Lefford’s wagons: mail hauberk and coif, a dead </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">knight’s gorget, lobstered greaves and gauntlets and pointed steel boots. Some of it </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was ornate, some plain; not a bit of it matched, or fit as it should. His breastplate </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was meant for a bigger man; for his oversize head, they found a huge bucket-shaped </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="496" height="22" font="2">greathelm topped with a foot-long triangular spike. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Shae helped Pod with the buckles and clasps. “If I die, weep for me,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="151" height="22" font="2">told the whore. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="384" height="22" font="2">“How will you know? You’ll be dead.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="122" height="22" font="2">“I’ll know.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I believe you would.” Shae lowered the greathelm down over his head, and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Pod fastened it to his gorget. Tyrion buckled on his belt, heavy with the weight of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">shortsword and dirk. By then his groom had brought up his mount, a formidable </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">brown courser armored as heavily as he was. He needed help to mount; he felt as </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">though he weighed a thousand stone. Pod handed him up his shield, a massive slab </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of heavy ironwood banded with steel. Lastly they gave him his battle-axe. Shae </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="594" height="22" font="2">stepped back and looked him over. “M’lord looks fearsome.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“M’lord looks a dwarf in mismatched armor,” Tyrion answered sourly, “but I </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thank you for the kindness. Podrick, should the battle go against us, see the lady </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">safely home.” He saluted her with his axe, wheeled his horse about, and trotted off. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">His stomach was a hard knot, so tight it pained him. Behind, his servants hurriedly </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">began to strike his tent. Pale crimson fingers fanned out to the east as the first rays </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of the sun broke over the horizon. The western sky was a deep purple, speckled </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">with stars. Tyrion wondered whether this was the last sunrise he would ever </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">see. . . and whether wondering was a mark of cowardice. Did his brother Jaime ever </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">contemplate death before a battle? </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A warhorn sounded in the far distance, a deep mournful note that chilled the </text>

<page number="546" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">soul. The clansmen climbed onto their scrawny mountain horses, shouting curses </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and rude jokes. Several appeared to be drunk. The  rising sun was burning off the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">drifting tendrils of fog as Tyrion led them off. What grass the horses had left was </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">heavy with dew, as if some passing god had scattered a bag of diamonds over the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">earth. The mountain men fell in behind him, each clan arrayed behind its own </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="80" height="22" font="2">leaders. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">In the dawn light, the army of Lord Tywin Lannister unfolded like an iron </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">rose, thorns gleaming. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">kingsroad. Quivers hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into three long lines, to east and west of the road, and stood calmly stringing their </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">bows. Between them, pikemen formed squares; behind were rank on rank of men-</text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">at-arms with spear and sword and axe. Three hundred heavy horse surrounded Ser </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Kevan and the lords bannermen Lefford, Lydden, and Serrett with all their sworn </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="95" height="22" font="2">retainers. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The right wing was all cavalry, some four thousand men, heavy with the </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">weight of their armor. More than three quarters of the knights were there, massed </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">together like a great steel fist. Ser Addam Marbrand had the command. Tyrion saw </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his banner unfurl as his standardbearer shook it out; a burning tree, orange and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">smoke. Behind him flew Ser Flement’s purple unicorn, the brindled boar of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="487" height="22" font="2">Crakehall, the bantam rooster of Swyft, and more. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His lord father took his place on the hill where he had slept. Around him, the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">reserve assembled; a huge force, half mounted and half foot, five thousand strong. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin almost always chose to command the reserve; he would take the high </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ground and watch the battle unfold below him, committing his forces when and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="297" height="22" font="2">where they were needed most. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Even from afar, his lord father was resplendent. Tywin Lannister’s battle </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">armor put his son Jaime’s gilded suit to shame. His greatcloak was sewn from </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">countless layers of cloth-of-gold, so heavy that it barely stirred even when he </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">charged, so large that its drape covered most of his stallion’s hindquarters when he </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">took the saddle. No ordinary clasp would suffice for such a weight, so the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">greatcloak was held in place by a matched pair of miniature lionesses crouching on </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his shoulders, as if poised to spring. Their mate, a male with a magnificent mane, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">reclined atop Lord Tywin’s greathelm, one paw raking the air as he roared. All </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">three lions were wrought in gold, with ruby eyes. His armor was heavy steel plate, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">enameled in a dark crimson, greaves and gauntlets inlaid with ornate gold </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">scrollwork. His rondels were golden sunbursts, all his fastenings were gilded, and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the red steel was burnished to such a high sheen that it shone like fire in the light of </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion could hear the rumble of the foemen’s drums now. He remembered </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Robb Stark as he had last seen him, in his father’s high seat in the Great Hall of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Winterfell, a sword naked and shining in his hands. He remembered how the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">direwolves had come at him out of the shadows, and suddenly he could see them </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">again, snarling and snapping, teeth bared in his face. Would the boy bring his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="546" height="22" font="2">wolves to war with him? The thought made him uneasy. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The northerners would be exhausted after their long sleepless march. Tyrion </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wondered what the boy had been thinking. Did he think to take them unawares </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">while they slept? Small chance of that; whatever else might be said of him, Tywin </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="285" height="22" font="2">Lannister was no man’s fool. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The van was massing on the left. He saw the standard first, three black dogs </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on a yellow field. Ser Gregor sat beneath it, mounted on the biggest horse Tyrion </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had ever seen. Bronn took one look at him and grinned. “Always follow a big man </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">into battle.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="486" height="22" font="2">Tyrion threw him a hard look. “And why is that?” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“They make such splendid targets. That one, he’ll draw the eyes of every </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="221" height="22" font="2">bowman on the field.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Laughing, Tyrion regarded the Mountain with fresh eyes. “I confess, I had not </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="263" height="22" font="2">considered it in that light.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Clegane had no splendor about him; his armor was steel plate, dull grey, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">scarred by hard use and showing neither sigil nor ornament. He was pointing men </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">into position with his blade, a two-handed greatsword that Ser Gregor waved about </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with one hand as a lesser man might wave a dagger. “Any man runs, I’ll cut him </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down myself,” he was roaring when he caught sight of Tyrion. “Imp! Take the left. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">Hold the river. If you can.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The left of the left. To turn their flank, the Starks would need horses that </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could run on water. Tyrion led his men toward the riverbank. “Look,” he shouted, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pointing with his axe. “The river.” A blanket of pale mist still clung to the surface </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the water, the murky green current swirling past underneath. The shallows were </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">muddy and choked with reeds. “That river is ours. Whatever happens, keep close to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the water. Never lose sight of it. Let no enemy come between us and our river. If </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="688" height="22" font="2">they dirty our waters, hack off their cocks and feed them to the fishes.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Shagga had an axe in either hand. He smashed them together and made them </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ring. “<i>Halfman!</i>” he shouted. Other Stone Crows picked up the cry, and the Black </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Ears and Moon Brothers as well. The Burned Men did not shout, but they rattled </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="552" height="22" font="2">their swords and spears. “<i>Halfman! Halfman! Halfman!</i>” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion turned his courser in a circle to look over the field. The ground was </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">rolling and uneven here; soft and muddy near the river, rising in a gentle slope </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">toward the kingsroad, stony and broken beyond it, to the cast. A few trees spotted </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the hillsides, but most of the land had been cleared and planted. His heart pounded </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in his chest in time to the drums, and under his layers of leather and steel his brow </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was cold with sweat. He watched Ser Gregor as the Mountain rode up and down the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">line, shouting and gesticulating. This wing too was all cavalry, but where the right </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was a mailed fist of knights and heavy lancers, the vanguard was made up of the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">sweepings of the west: mounted archers in leather jerkins, a swarming mass of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">undisciplined freeriders and sellswords, fieldhands on plow horses armed with </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">scythes and their fathers’ rusted swords, half-trained boys from the stews of </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="526" height="22" font="2">Lannisport. . . and Tyrion and his mountain clansmen. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Crow food,” Bronn muttered beside him, giving voice to what Tyrion had </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">left unsaid. He could only nod. Had his lord father taken leave of his senses? No </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pikes, too few bowmen, a bare handful of knights, the ill-armed and unarmored, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">commanded by an unthinking brute who led with his rage. . . how could his father </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="449" height="22" font="2">expect this travesty of a battle to hold his left? </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He had no time to think about it. The drums were so near that the beat crept </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">under his skin and set his hands to twitching. Bronn drew his longsword, and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">suddenly the enemy was there before them, boiling over the tops of the hills, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">advancing with measured tread behind a wall of shields and pikes. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Gods be damned, look at them all</i>, Tyrion thought, though he knew his father </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">had more men on the field. Their captains led them on armored warhorses, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">standard-bearers riding alongside with their banners. He glimpsed the bull moose of </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the Hornwoods, the Karstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn’s battle-axe, and the mailed </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fist of the Glovers. . . <i>and  </i>the twin towers of Frey, blue on grey. So much for his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">father’s certainty that Lord Walder would not bestir himself. The white of House </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Stark was seen everywhere, the grey direwolves seeming to run and leap as the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">banners swirled and streamed from the high staffs.  <i>Where is the boy?</i>  Tyrion </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="107" height="22" font="2">wondered. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A warhorn blew. <i>Haroooooooooooooooooooooooo</i>, it cried, its voice as long </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">and low and chilling as a cold wind from the north. The Lannister trumpets </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">answered,  <i>da-DA da-DA da-DAAAAAAAAA,</i>  brazen and defiant, yet it seemed to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Tyrion that they sounded somehow smaller, more anxious. He could feel a </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fluttering in his bowels, a queasy liquid feeling; he hoped he was not going to die </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">sick. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As the horns died away, a hissing filled the air; a vast flight of arrows arched </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">up from his right, where the archers stood flanking the road. The northerners broke </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">into a run, shouting as they came, but the Lannister arrows fell on them like hail, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">hundreds of arrows, thousands, and shouts turned to screams as men stumbled and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">went down. By then a second flight was in the air, and the archers were fitting a </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="305" height="22" font="2">third arrow to their bowstrings. </text>
</page>
<page number="549" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">The trumpets blared again,  <i>da-DAAA da-DAAA da-DA da-DA da-</i></text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>DAAAAAAA</i>.  Ser Gregor waved his huge sword and bellowed a command, and a </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thousand other voices screamed back at him. Tyrion put his spurs to his horse and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">added one more voice to the cacophony, and the van surged forward. “The river!” </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he shouted at his clansmen as they rode. “Remember, hew to the river.” He was still </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">leading when they broke a canter, until Chella gave a bloodcurdling shriek and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">galloped past him, and Shagga howled and followed. The clansmen charged after </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">them, leaving Tyrion in their dust. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A crescent of enemy spearmen had formed ahead, a double hedgehog bristling </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with steel, waiting behind tall oaken shields marked with the sunburst of Karstark. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Gregor Clegane was the first to reach them, leading a wedge of armored veterans. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Half the horses shied at the last second, breaking their charge before the row of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">spears. The others died, sharp steel points ripping through their chests. Tyrion saw a </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dozen men go down. The Mountain’s stallion reared, lashing out with iron-shod </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hooves as a barbed spearhead raked across his neck. Maddened, the beast lunged </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">into the ranks. Spears thrust at him from every side, but the shield wall broke </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beneath his weight. The northerners stumbled away from the animal’s death throes. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">As his horse fell, snorting blood and biting with his last red breath, the Mountain </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="647" height="22" font="2">rose untouched, laying about him with his two-handed greatsword. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Shagga went bursting through the gap before the shields could close, other </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Stone Crows hard behind him. Tyrion shouted, “Burned Men! Moon Brothers! </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">After me!” but most of them were <i>ahead</i> of him. He glimpsed Timett son of Timett </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">vault free as his mount died under him in full stride, saw a Moon Brother impaled </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">on a Karstark spear, watched Conn’s horse shatter a man’s ribs with a kick. A flight </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of arrows descended on them; where they came from he could not say, but they fell </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">on Stark and Lannister alike, rattling off armor or finding flesh. Tyrion lifted his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="247" height="22" font="2">shield and hid beneath it. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The hedgehog was crumbling, the northerners reeling back under the impact </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the mounted assault. Tyrion saw Shagga catch a spearman full in the chest as the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fool came on at a run, saw his axe shear through mail and leather and muscle and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lungs. The man was dead on his feet, the axehead lodged in his breast, yet Shagga </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rode on, cleaving a shield in two with his left-hand battle-axe while the corpse was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bouncing and stumbling bonelessly along on his right. Finally the dead man slid off. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="490" height="22" font="2">Shagga smashed the two axes together and roared. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By then the enemy was on him, and Tyrion’s battle shrunk to the few feet of </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ground around his horse. A man-at-arms thrust at his chest and his axe lashed out, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knocking the spear aside. The man danced back for another try, but Tyrion spurred </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his horse and rode right over him. Bronn was surrounded by three foes, but he </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lopped the head off the first spear that came at him, and raked his blade across a </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="352" height="22" font="2">second man’s face on his backslash. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A thrown spear came hurtling at Tyrion from the left and lodged in his shield </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with a woody <i>chunk</i>. He wheeled and raced after the thrower, but the man raised his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">own shield over his head. Tyrion circled around him, raining axe blows down on </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the wood. Chips of oak went flying, until the northerner lost his feet and slipped, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">failing flat on his back with his shield on top of him. He was below the reach of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s axe and it was too much bother to dismount, so he left him there and rode </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">after another man, taking him from behind with a sweeping downcut that sent a jolt </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of impact up his arm. That won him a moment’s respite. Reining up, he looked for </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="758" height="22" font="2">the river. There it was, off to the right. Somehow he had gotten turned around. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A Burned Man rode past, slumped against his horse. A spear had entered his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">belly and come out through his back. He was past any help, but when Tyrion saw </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="693" height="22" font="2">one of the northerners run up and make a grab for his reins, he charged. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">His quarry met him sword in hand. He was tall and spare, wearing a long </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">chainmail hauberk and gauntlets of lobstered steel, but he’d lost his helm and blood </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ran down into his eyes from a gash across his forehead. Tyrion aimed a swipe at his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">face, but the tall man slammed it aside. “Dwarf,” he screamed. “Die.” He turned in </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a circle as Tyrion rode around him, hacking at his head and shoulders. Steel rang on </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">steel, and Tyrion soon realized that the tall man was quicker and stronger than he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was. Where in the seven hells was Bronn? “Die,” the man grunted, chopping at him </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">savagely. Tyrion barely got his shield up in time, and the wood seemed to explode </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">inward under the force of the blow. The shattered pieces fell away from his arm. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“<i>Die!</i>” the swordsman bellowed, shoving in close and whanging Tyrion across the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">temple so hard his head rang. The blade made a hideous scraping sound as he drew </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it back over the steel. The tall man grinned. . . until Tyrion’s destrier bit, quick as a </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">snake, laying his cheek bare to the bone. Then he screamed. Tyrion buried his axe </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">in his head. “<i>You </i>die,” he told him, and he did. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As he wrenched the blade free, he heard a shout. ‘<i>Eddard!</i>” a voice rang out. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“<i>For Eddard and Winterfell!</i>” The knight came thundering down on him, swinging </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the spiked ball of a morningstar around his head. Their warhorses slammed together </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">before Tyrion could so much as open his mouth to shout for Bronn. His right elbow </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">exploded with pain as the spikes punched through the thin metal around the joint. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">His axe was gone, as fast as that. He clawed for his sword, but the morningstar was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">circling again, coming at his face. A sickening <i>crunch</i>, and he was falling. He did </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not recall hitting the ground, but when he looked up there was only sky above him. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He rolled onto his side and tried to find his feet, but pain shuddered through him </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and the world throbbed. The knight who had felled  him drew up above him. </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Tyrion the Imp,” he boomed down. “You are mine. Do you yield, Lannister?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>Yes</i>, Tyrion thought, but the word caught in his throat. He made a croaking </text>

<page number="551" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sound and fought his way to his knees, fumbling for a weapon. His sword, his dirk, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="126" height="22" font="2">anything. . .  </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Do you yield?” The knight loomed overhead on his armored warhorse. Man </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and horse both seemed immense. The spiked ball swung in a lazy circle. Tyrion’s </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hands were numb, his vision blurred, his scabbard empty. “Yield or die,” the knight </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="425" height="22" font="2">declared, his flail whirling faster and faster. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion lurched to his feet, driving his head into the horse’s belly. The animal </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gave a hideous scream and reared. It tried to twist away from the agony, a shower </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of blood and viscera poured down over Tyrion’s face,  and the horse fell like an </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">avalanche. The next he knew, his visor was packed with mud and something was </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">crushing his foot. He wriggled free, his throat so tight he could scarce talk. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">“. . . yield. . .” he managed to croak faintly. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="389" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” a voice moaned, thick with pain. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion scraped the mud off his helm so he could see again. The horse had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fallen away from him, onto its rider. The knight’s leg was trapped, the arm he’d </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">used to break his fall twisted at a grotesque angle. “Yield,” he repeated. Fumbling at </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his belt with his good hand, he drew a sword and flung it at Tyrion’s feet. “I yield, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">my lord.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dazed, the dwarf knelt and lifted the blade. Pain hammered through his elbow </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when he moved his arm. The battle seemed to have moved beyond him. No one </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">remained on his part of the field save a large number of corpses. Ravens were </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">already circling and landing to feed. He saw that Ser Kevan had brought up his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">center in support of the van; his huge mass of pikemen had pushed the northerners </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">back against the hills. They were struggling on the slopes, pikes thrusting against </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">another wall of shields, these oval and reinforced with iron studs. As he watched, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the air filled with arrows again, and the men behind the oak wall crumbled beneath </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the murderous fire. “I believe you are losing, ser,” he told the knight under the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="304" height="22" font="2">horse. The man made no reply. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The sound of hooves coming up behind him made him whirl, though he could </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">scarcely lift the sword he held for the agony in his elbow. Bronn  reined up and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="210" height="22" font="2">looked down on him. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="491" height="22" font="2">“Small use you turned out to be,” Tyrion told him. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It would seem you did well enough on your own,” Bronn answered. “You’ve </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">lost the spike off your helm, though.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion groped at the top of the greathelm. The spike had snapped off clean. “I </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="600" height="22" font="2">haven’t lost it. I know just where it is. Do you see my horse?” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">By the time they found it, the trumpets had sounded again and Lord Tywin’s </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">reserve came sweeping up along the river. Tyrion watched his father fly past, the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">crimson-and-gold banner of Lannister rippling over his head as he thundered across </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the field. Five hundred knights surrounded him, sunlight flashing off the points of </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">their lances. The remnants of the Stark lines shattered like glass beneath the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="237" height="22" font="2">hammer of their charge. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">With his elbow swollen and throbbing inside his armor, Tyrion made no </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">attempt to join the slaughter. He and Bronn went looking for his men. Many he </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">found among the dead. Ulf son of Umar lay in a pool of congealing blood, his arm </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">gone at the elbow, a dozen of his Moon Brothers sprawled around him. Shagga was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slumped beneath a tree, riddled with arrows, Conn’s head in his lap. Tyrion thought </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they were both dead, but as he dismounted, Shagga opened his eyes and said, “They </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">have killed Conn son of Coratt.” Handsome Conn had no mark but for the red stain </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">over his breast, where the spear thrust had killed him. When Bronn pulled Shagga </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to his feet, the big man seemed to notice the arrows for the first time. He plucked </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">them out one by one, cursing the holes they had made in his layers of mail and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leather, and yowling like a babe at the few that had buried themselves in his flesh. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Chella daughter of Cheyk rode up as they were yanking arrows out of Shagga, and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">showed them four ears she had taken. Timett they discovered looting the bodies of </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the slain with his Burned Men. Of the three hundred clansmen who had ridden to </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="564" height="22" font="2">battle behind Tyrion Lannister, perhaps half had survived. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">He left the living to look after the dead, sent Bronn to take charge of his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">captive knight, and went alone in search of his father. Lord Tywin was seated by the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">river, sipping wine from a jeweled cup as his squire undid the fastenings on his </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">breastplate. “A fine victory,” Ser Kevan said when he saw Tyrion. “Your wild men </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="133" height="22" font="2">fought well.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">His father’s eyes were on him, pale green flecked with gold, so cool they gave </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Tyrion a chill. “Did that surprise you, Father?” he asked. “Did it upset your plans? </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="492" height="22" font="2">We were supposed to be butchered, were we not?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin drained his cup, his face expressionless. “I put the least </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">disciplined men on the left, yes. I anticipated that they would break. Robb Stark is a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">green boy, more like to be brave than wise. I’d hoped that if he saw our left </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">collapse, he might plunge into the gap, eager for a rout. Once he was fully </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">committed, Ser Kevan’s pikes would wheel and take him in the flank, driving him </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="441" height="22" font="2">into the river while I brought up the reserve.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And you thought it best to place me in the midst of this carnage, yet keep me </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">ignorant of your plans.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“A feigned rout is less convincing,” his father said, “and I am not inclined to </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">trust my plans to a man who consorts with sellswords and savages.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A pity my savages ruined your dance.” Tyrion pulled off his steel gauntlet </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="692" height="22" font="2">and let it fall to the ground, wincing at the pain that stabbed up his arm. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“The Stark boy proved more cautious than I expected for one of his years,” </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="755" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin admitted, “but a victory is a victory. You appear to be wounded.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Tyrion’s right arm was soaked with blood. “Good of you to notice, Father,” he </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">said through clenched teeth. “Might I trouble you to send for your maesters? Unless </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">An urgent shout of “<i>Lord Tywin!</i>” turned his father’s head before he could </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">reply. Tywin Lannister rose to his feet as Ser Addam Marbrand leapt down off his </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">courser. The horse was lathered and bleeding from the mouth. Ser Addam dropped </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to one knee, a rangy man with dark copper hair that fell to his shoulders, armored in </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">burnished bronzed steel with the fiery tree of his House etched black on his </text>

<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It should not be long now, my lady,” Hallis Mollen said. He had asked for </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the honor of protecting her in the battle to come; it was his right, as Winterfell’s </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">captain of guards, and Robb had not refused it to him. She had thirty men around </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">her, charged to keep her unharmed and see her safely home to Winterfell if the </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fighting went against them. Robb had wanted fifty; Catelyn had insisted that ten </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">would be enough, that he would need every sword for the fight. They made their </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="359" height="22" font="2">peace at thirty, neither happy with it. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It will come when it comes,” Catelyn told him. When it came, she knew it </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">would mean death. Hal’s death perhaps. . . or hers, or Robb’s. No one was safe. No </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">life was certain. Catelyn was content to wait, to listen to the whispers in the woods </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="646" height="22" font="2">and the faint music of the brook, to feel the warm wind in her hair. </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She was no stranger to waiting, after all. Her men had always made her wait. </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“Watch for me, little cat,” her father would always tell her, when he rode off to </text>

<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Riverrun as the waters of the Red Fork and the Tumblestone flowed by. He did not </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">always come when he said he would, and days would ofttimes pass as Catelyn stood </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her vigil, peering out between crenels and through arrow loops until she caught a </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">glimpse of Lord Hoster on his old brown gelding, trotting along the rivershore </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">toward the landing. “Did you watch for me?” he’d ask when he bent to bug her. </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="206" height="22" font="2">“Did you, little cat?” </text>
<text top="980" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Brandon Stark had bid her wait as well. “I shall not be long, my lady,” he had </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">been born in Riverrun while his father still warred in the south. She had brought </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him forth in blood and pain, not knowing whether Ned would ever see him. Her </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">And now it was for Robb that she waited. . . for Robb, and for Jaime </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lannister, the gilded knight who men said had never learned to wait at all. “The </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Kingslayer is restless, and quick to anger,” her uncle Brynden had told Robb. And </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">he had wagered their lives and their best hope of victory on the truth of what he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">said. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">If Robb was frightened, he gave no sign of it. Catelyn watched her son as he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">moved among the men, touching one on the shoulder, sharing a jest with another, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">helping a third to gentle an anxious horse. His armor clinked softly when he moved. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Only his head was bare. Catelyn watched a breeze stir his auburn hair, so like her </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">own, and wondered when her son had grown so big. Fifteen, and near as tall as she </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">was. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="4"><i>Let him grow taller</i>, she asked the gods. <i>Let him know sixteen, and twenty, and </i></text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>fifty. Let him grow as tall as his father, and hold his own son in his arms. Please, </i></text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>please, please</i>. As she watched him, this tall young man with the new beard and the </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The night was warm, but the thought of Riverrun was enough to make her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shiver. <i>Where are they? </i>she wondered. Could her uncle have been wrong? So much </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">rested on the truth of what he had told them. Robb had given the Blackfish three </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hundred picked men, and sent them ahead to screen his march. “Jaime does not </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">know,” Ser Brynden said when he rode back. “I’ll stake my life on that. No bird has </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">reached him, my archers have seen to that. We’ve seen a few of his outriders, but </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">those that saw us did not live to tell of it. He ought to have sent out more. He does </text>

<text top="832" left="108" width="383" height="22" font="2">“How large is his host?” her son asked. </text>

<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with the rivers between,” her uncle said, with the craggy smile she remembered so </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">well. “There is no other way to besiege Riverrun, yet still, that will be their </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="388" height="22" font="2">undoing. Two or three thousand horse.” </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Catelyn watched her son mount up. Olyvar Frey held his horse for him, Lord </text>

<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her son had been. It was dark among the trees, where the moon did not reach. When </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Robb  turned his head to look at her, she could see only black inside his visor. “I </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">must ride down the line, Mother,” he told her. “Father says you should let the men </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">see you before a battle.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="400" height="22" font="2">‘Go, then,” she said. “Let them see you.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="381" height="22" font="2">‘It will give them courage,” Robb said. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="4"><i>And who will give me courage?  </i>she wondered, yet she kept her silence and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">made herself smile for him. Robb turned the big grey stallion and walked him </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">slowly away from her, Grey Wind shadowing his steps. Behind him his battle guard </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">formed up. When he’d forced Catelyn to accept her protectors, she had insisted that </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he be guarded as well, and the lords bannermen had agreed. Many of their sons had </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">clamored for the honor of riding with the Young Wolf, as they had taken to calling </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him. Torrhen Karstark and his brother Eddard were among his thirty, and Patrek </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Mallister, Smalljon Umber, Daryn Hornwood, Theon Greyjoy, no less than five of </text>

<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lords muttered about that, but Catelyn would not listen to their complaints. “This is </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not about the honor of your houses,” she told them. “This is about keeping my son </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="4"><i>And if it comes to that</i>, she wondered, <i>will thirty be enough? Will six thousand </i></text>

<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A bird called faintly in the distance, a high sharp trill that felt like an icy hand </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">on Catelyn’s neck. Another bird answered; a third, a fourth. She knew their call </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">well enough, from her years at Winterfell. Snow shrikes. Sometimes you saw them </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">in the deep of winter, when the godswood was white and still. They were northern </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="382" height="22" font="2">stating the obvious. “Gods be with us.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She nodded as the woods grew still around them. In the quiet she could hear </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">them, far off yet moving closer; the tread of many horses, the rattle of swords and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">spears and armor, the murmur of human voices, with here a laugh, and there a </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">curse. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Eons seemed to come and go. The sounds grew louder. She heard more </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">laughter, a shouted command, splashing as they crossed and recrossed the little </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stream. A horse snorted. A man swore. And then at last she saw him. . . only for an </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">instant, framed between the branches of the trees as she looked down at the valley </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">floor, yet she knew it was  him. Even at a distance, Ser Jaime Lannister was </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">unmistakable. The moonlight had silvered his armor and the gold of his hair, and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="605" height="22" font="2">turned his crimson cloak to black. He was not wearing a helm. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He was there and he was gone again, his silvery armor obscured by the trees </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">once more. Others came behind him, long columns of them, knights and sworn </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="578" height="22" font="2">swords and freeriders, three quarters of the Lannister horse. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He is no man for sitting in a tent while his carpenters build siege towers,” Ser </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Brynden had promised. “He has ridden out with his knights thrice already, to chase </text>

<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Nodding, Robb had studied the map her uncle had drawn him. Ned had taught </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">him to read maps. “Raid him  <i>here</i>,” he said, pointing. “A few hundred men, no </text>

<text top="639" left="54" width="338" height="22" font="2">moved an inch to the left—“here.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Here </i>was a hush in the night, moonlight and shadows, a thick carpet of dead </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">leaves underfoot, densely wooded ridges sloping gently down to the streambed, the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="436" height="22" font="2">underbrush thinning as the ground fell away. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Here </i>was her son on his stallion, glancing back at her one last time and lifting </text>

<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>Here </i>was the call of Maege Mormont’s warhorn, a long low blast that rolled </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">down the valley from the east, to tell them that the last of Jaime’s riders had entered </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">the trap. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="481" height="22" font="2">And Grey Wind threw back his head and howled. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The sound seemed to go right through Catelyn Stark, and she found herself </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shivering. It was a terrible sound, a frightening sound, yet there was music in it too. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">For a second she felt something like pity for the Lannisters below. <i>So this is what </i></text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="4"><i>death sounds like</i>, she thought. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>HAAroooooooooooooooooooooooo</i>came the answer from the far ridge as the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Greatjon winded his own horn. To east and west, the trumpets of the Mallisters and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Freys blew vengeance. North, where the valley narrowed and bent like a cocked </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">elbow, Lord Karstark’s warhorns added their own deep, mournful voices to the dark </text>

<page number="558" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="650" height="22" font="2">chorus. Men were shouting and horses rearing in the stream below. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The whispering wood let out its breath all at once, as the bowmen Robb had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hidden in the branches of the trees let fly their arrows and the night erupted with the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">screams of men and horses. All around her, the riders raised their lances, and the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dirt and leaves that had buried the cruel bright points fell away to reveal the gleam </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of sharpened steel. “<i>Winterfell!</i>” she heard Robb shout as the arrows sighed again. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="592" height="22" font="2">He moved away from her at a trot, leading his men downhill. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Catelyn sat on her horse, unmoving, with Hal Mollen and her guard around </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her, and she waited as she had waited before, for Brandon and Ned and her father. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">She was high on the ridge, and the trees hid most of what was going on beneath her. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">A heartbeat, two, four, and suddenly it was as if she and her protectors were alone </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="534" height="22" font="2">in the wood. The rest were melted away into the green. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Yet when she looked across the valley to the far ridge, she saw the Greatjon’s </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">riders emerge from the darkness beneath the trees. They were in a long line, an </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">endless line, and as they burst from the wood there was an instant, the smallest part </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">of a heartbeat, when all Catelyn saw was the moonlight on the points of their lances, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">as if a thousand willowisps were coming down the ridge, wreathed in silver flame. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="687" height="22" font="2">Then she blinked, and they were only men, rushing down to kill or die. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Afterward, she could not claim she had seen the battle. Yet she could hear, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the valley rang with echoes. The <i>crack</i> of a broken lance, the clash of swords, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the cries of “Lannister” and “Winterfell” and “Tully! Riverrun and Tully!” When </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she realized there was no more to see, she closed her eyes and listened. The battle </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">came alive around her. She heard hoofbeats, iron boots splashing in shallow water, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the woody sound of swords on oaken shields and the scrape of steel against steel, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the hiss of arrows, the thunder of drums, the terrified screaming of a thousand </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">horses. Men shouted curses and begged for mercy, and got it (or not), and lived (or </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">died). The ridges seemed to play queer tricks with sound. Once she heard Robb’s </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">voice, as clear as if he’d been standing at her side, calling, “To me! To me!” And </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">she heard his direwolf, snarling and growling, heard the snap of those long teeth, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the tearing of flesh, shrieks of fear and pain from man and horse alike. Was there </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="393" height="22" font="2">only one wolf? It was hard to be certain. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Little by little, the sounds dwindled and died, until at last there was only the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="689" height="22" font="2">wolf. As a red dawn broke in the east, Grey Wind began to howl again. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Robb came back to her on a different horse, riding a piebald gelding in the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">place of the grey stallion he had taken down into the valley. The wolf’s head on his </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shield was slashed half to pieces, raw wood showing where deep gouges had been </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">hacked in the oak, but Robb himself seemed unhurt. Yet  when he came closer, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Catelyn saw that his mailed glove and the sleeve of his surcoat were black with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="301" height="22" font="2">blood. “You’re hurt,” she said. </text>
</page>
<page number="559" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Robb lifted his hand, opened and closed his fingers. “No,” he said. “This </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="728" height="22" font="2">is. . . Torrhen’s blood, perhaps, or. . .” He shook his head. “I do not know.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A mob of men followed him up the slope, dirty and dented and grinning, with </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">Theon and the Greatjon at their head. Between them they dragged Ser Jaime </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Lannister. They threw him down in front of her horse. “The Kingslayer,” Hal </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="259" height="22" font="2">announced, unnecessarily. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Lannister raised his head. “Lady Stark,” he said from his knees. Blood ran </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down one cheek from a gash across his scalp, but the pale light of dawn had put the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">glint of gold back in his hair. “I would offer you my sword, but I seem to  have </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">mislaid it.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It is not your sword I want, ser,” she told him. “Give me my father and my </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="665" height="22" font="2">brother Edmure. Give me my daughters. Give me my lord husband.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="360" height="22" font="2">“I have mislaid them as well, I fear.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="291" height="22" font="2">“A pity,” Catelyn said coldly. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="597" height="22" font="2">“Kill him, Robb,” Theon Greyjoy urged. “Take his head off.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” her son answered, peeling off his bloody glove. “He’s more use alive </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">than dead. And my lord father never condoned the murder of prisoners after a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="76" height="22" font="2">battle.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="527" height="22" font="2">“A wise man,” Jaime Lannister said, “and honorable.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="512" height="22" font="2">“Take him away and put him in irons,” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Do as my lady mother says,” Robb commanded, “and make certain there’s a </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="682" height="22" font="2">strong guard around him. Lord Karstark will want his head on a pike.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“That he will,” the Greatjon agreed, gesturing. Lannister was led away to be </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="225" height="22" font="2">bandaged and chained. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="591" height="22" font="2">“Why should Lord Karstark want him dead?” Catelyn asked. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Robb looked away into the woods, with the same brooding look that Ned </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="357" height="22" font="2">often got. “He. . . he killed them. . .” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="491" height="22" font="2">“Lord Karstark’s sons,” Galbart Glover explained. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Both of them,” said Robb. “Torrhen and Eddard. And Daryn Hornwood as </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">well.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No one can fault Lannister on his courage,” Glover said. “When he saw that </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">he was lost, he rallied his retainers and fought his way up the valley, hoping to </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="524" height="22" font="2">reach Lord Robb and cut him down. And almost did.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“He  <i>mislaid</i>  his sword in Eddard Karstark’s neck, after he took Torrhen’s </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hand off and split Daryn Hornwood’s skull open,” Robb said. “All the time he was </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="499" height="22" font="2">shouting for me. If they hadn’t tried to stop him—” </text>

<text top="290" left="122" width="426" height="22" font="2">edge of hearing that filled Dany with dread. </text>
<text top="318" left="176" width="695" height="22" font="2">The sun was high and pitiless. Heat shimmered in waves off the stony </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">outcrops of low hills. A thin finger  of sweat trickled slowly between Dany’s </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">swollen breasts. The only sounds were the steady clop of their horses’ hooves, the </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="769" height="22" font="2">rhythmic tingle of the bells in Drogo’s hair, and the distant voices behind them. </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="233" height="22" font="2">Dany watched the flies. </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They were as large as bees, gross, purplish, glistening. The Dothraki called </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them <i>bloodflies</i>. They lived in marshes and stagnant pools, sucked blood from man </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and horse alike, and laid their eggs in the dead and dying. Drogo hated them. </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Whenever one came near him, his hand would shoot out quick as a striking snake to </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">close around it. She had never seen him miss. He would hold the fly inside his huge </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fist long enough to hear its frantic buzzing. Then his fingers would tighten, and </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="764" height="22" font="2">when he opened his hand again, the fly would be only a red smear on his palm. </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Now one crept across the rump of his stallion, and the horse gave an angry </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">flick of its tail to brush it away. The others flitted about Drogo, closer and closer. </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The <i>khal</i> did not react. His eyes were fixed on distant brown hills, the reins loose in </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">his hands. Beneath his painted vest, a plaster of fig leaves and caked blue mud </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">covered the wound on his breast. The herbwomen had made it for him. Mirri Maz </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Duur’s poultice had itched and burned, and he had torn it off six days ago, cursing </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her for a <i>maegi</i>. The mud plaster was more soothing, and the herbwomen made him </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">poppy wine as well. He’d been drinking it heavily these past three days; when it </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="642" height="22" font="2">was not poppy wine, it was fermented mare’s milk or pepper beer. </text>
<text top="897" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Yet he scarcely touched his food, and he thrashed and groaned in the night. </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dany could see how drawn his face had become. Rhaego was restless in her belly, </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">kicking like a stallion, yet even that did not stir Drogo’s interest as it had. Every </text>

<text top="1063" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">but a grunt, and not even that much since midday. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">One of the bloodflies landed on the bare skin of the <i>khal</i>’s shoulder. Another, </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swayed in the saddle, bells ringing, as his stallion kept onward at a steady walking </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="56" height="22" font="2">pace. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany pressed her heels into her silver and rode closer. “My lord,” she said </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="341" height="22" font="2">softly. “Drogo. My sun-and-stars.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">He did not seem to hear. The bloodfly crawled up under his drooping </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">mustache and settled on his cheek, in the crease beside his nose. Dany gasped, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="563" height="22" font="2">“<i>Drogo</i>.” Clumsily she reached over and touched his arm. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo reeled in the saddle, tilted slowly, and fell heavily from his horse. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The flies scattered for a heartbeat, and then circled back to settle on him where he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="41" height="22" font="2">lay. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“No,” Dany said, reining up. Heedless of her belly for once, she scrambled off </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="247" height="22" font="2">her silver and ran to him. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The grass beneath him was brown and dry. Drogo cried out in pain as Dany </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">knelt beside him. His breath rattled harshly in his throat, and he looked at her </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">without recognition. “My horse,” he gasped. Dany brushed the flies off his chest, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">smashing one as he would have. His skin burned beneath her fingers. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The <i>khal</i>’s bloodriders had been following just behind them. She heard Haggo </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shout as they galloped up. Cohollo vaulted from his horse. “Blood of my blood,” he </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">said as he dropped to his knees. The other two kept to their mounts. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="759" height="22" font="2">“No,” Khal Drogo groaned, struggling in Dany’s arms. “Must ride. Ride. No.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“He fell from his horse,” Haggo said, staring down. His broad face was </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">impassive, but his voice was leaden. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You must not say that,” Dany told him. “We have ridden far enough today. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">We will camp here.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="773" height="22" font="2">“Here?” Haggo looked around them. The land was brown and sere, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="420" height="22" font="2">inhospitable. “This is no camping ground.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="698" height="22" font="2">“It is not for a woman to bid us halt,” said Qotho, “not even a <i>khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“We camp here,” Dany repeated. “Haggo, tell them Khal Drogo commanded </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the halt. If any ask why, say to them that my time is near and I could not continue. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="772" height="22" font="2">Cohollo, bring up the slaves, they must put up the <i>khal</i>’s tent at once. Qotho—” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="490" height="22" font="2">“You do not command me, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Qotho said. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Find Mirri Maz Duur,” she told him. The godswife would be walking among </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the other Lamb Men, in the long column of slaves. “Bring her to me, with her </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="72" height="22" font="2">chest.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Qotho glared down at her, his eyes hard as flint. “The <i>maegi</i>.” He spat. “This I </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">will not do.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You will,” Dany said, “or when Drogo wakes, he will hear why you defied </text>

<page number="563" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Furious, Qotho wheeled his stallion around and galloped off in anger. . . but </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dany knew he would return with Mirri Maz Duur, however little he might like it. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The slaves erected Khal Drogo’s tent beneath a jagged outcrop of black rock whose </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadow gave some relief from the heat of the afternoon sun. Even so, it was stifling </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">under the sandsilk as Irri and Doreah helped Dany walk Drogo inside. Thick </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">patterned carpets had been laid down over the ground, and pillows scattered in the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">corners. Eroeh, the timid girl Dany had rescued outside the mud walls of the Lamb </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Men, set up a brazier. They stretched Drogo out on a woven mat. “No,” he muttered </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">in the Common Tongue. “No, no.” It was all he said, all he seemed capable of </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">saying. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Doreah unhooked his medallion belt and stripped off his vest and leggings, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">while Jhiqui knelt by his feet to undo the laces of his riding sandals. Irri wanted to </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">leave the tent flaps open to let in the breeze, but Dany forbade it. She would not </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have any see Drogo this way, in delirium and weakness. When her <i>khas</i> came up, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">she posted them outside at guard. “Admit no one without my leave,” she told Jhogo. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="103" height="22" font="2">“No one.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="695" height="22" font="2">Eroeh stared fearfully at Drogo where he lay. “He dies,” she whispered. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany slapped her. “The  <i>khal</i>  cannot die. He is the father of the stallion who </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mounts the world. His hair has never been cut. He still wears the bells his father </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">gave him.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>, “Jhiqui said, “he fell from his horse.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Trembling, her eyes full of sudden tears, Dany turned away from them. <i>He fell </i></text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>from his horse!</i>  It was so, she had seen it, and the bloodriders, and no doubt her </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">handmaids and the men of her <i>khas</i> as well. And how many more? They could not </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">keep it secret, and Dany knew what that meant. A <i>khal</i> who could not ride could not </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="409" height="22" font="2">rule, and Drogo had fallen from his horse. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“We must bathe him,” she said stubbornly. She must not allow herself to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">despair. “Irri, have the tub brought at once. Doreah, Eroeh, find water, cool water, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">he’s so hot.” He was a fire in human skin. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The slaves set up the heavy copper tub in the corner of the tent. When Doreah </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brought the first jar of water, Dany wet a length of silk to lay across Drogo’s brow, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">over the burning skin. His eyes looked at her, but he did not see. When his lips </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">opened, no words escaped them, only a moan. “Where is Mirri Maz Duur?” she </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="446" height="22" font="2">demanded, her patience rubbed raw with fear. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="305" height="22" font="2">“Qotho will find her,” Irri said. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her handmaids filled the tub with tepid water that stank of sulfur, sweetening </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">it with jars of bitter oil and handfuls of crushed mint leaves. While the bath was </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">being prepared, Dany knelt awkwardly beside her lord husband, her belly great with </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their child within. She undid his braid with anxious fingers, as she had on the night </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he’d taken her for the first time, beneath the stars. His bells she laid aside carefully, </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A breath of air entered the tent as Aggo poked his head through the silk. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="636" height="22" font="2">“<i>Khaleesi</i>, “he said, “the Andal is come, and begs leave to enter.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“The Andal” was what the Dothraki called Ser Jorah. “Yes,” she said, rising </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">clumsily, “send him in.” She trusted the knight. He would know what to do if </text>

<text top="308" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">of mottled sandsilk and open-toed riding sandals that laced up to his knee. His </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">scabbard hung from a twisted horsehair belt. Under a bleached white vest, he was </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The knight knelt beside her. He looked at Drogo long and hard, and then at </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="315" height="22" font="2">Dany. “Send your maids away.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Wordlessly, her throat tight with fear, Dany made a gesture. Irri herded the </text>

<text top="584" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When they were alone, Ser Jorah drew his dagger. Deftly, with a delicacy </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">surprising in such a big man, he began to scrape away the black leaves and dried </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">blue mud from Drogo’s chest. The plaster had caked hard as the mud walls of the </text>

<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his knife, pried the chunks from the flesh, peeled off the leaves one by one. A foul, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">sweet smell rose from the wound, so thick it almost choked her. The leaves were </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">crusted with blood and pus, Drogo’s breast black and glistening with corruption. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No,” Dany whispered as tears ran down her cheeks. “No, please, gods hear </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="88" height="22" font="2">me, <i>no</i>.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo thrashed, fighting some unseen enemy. Black blood ran slow and </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">thick from his open wound. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="375" height="22" font="2">“Your <i>khal</i> is good as dead, Princess.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“No, he can’t die, he <i>mustn’t</i>, it was only a cut.” Dany took his large callused </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hand in her own small ones, and held it tight between them. “I will not let him </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="82" height="22" font="2">die . . .” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah gave a bitter laugh. “<i>Khaleesi  </i>or  queen, that command is beyond </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">your power. Save your tears, child. Weep for him tomorrow, or a year from now. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="707" height="22" font="2">We do not have time for grief. We must go, and quickly, before he dies.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="430" height="22" font="2">Dany was lost. “Go? Where should we go?” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Asshai, I would say. It lies far to the south, at the end of the known world, </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="813" height="22" font="2">a hard journey, make no mistake. Do you trust your <i>khas</i>? Will they come with us?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Khal Drogo commanded them to keep me  safe,” Dany replied uncertainly, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“but if he dies. . .”  She touched the swell of her belly. “I don’t understand. Why </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">should we flee? I am <i>khaleesi</i>. I carry Drogo’s heir. He will be <i>khal</i> after Drogo. . .” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah frowned. “Princess, hear me. The Dothraki will  not follow a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">suckling babe. Drogo’s strength was what they bowed to, and only that. When he is </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">gone, Jhaqo and Pono and the other <i>kos</i>  will fight for his place, and this  <i>khalasar</i> </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">will devour itself. The winner will want no more rivals. The boy will be taken from </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="681" height="22" font="2">your breast the moment he is born. They will give him to the dogs. . .” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany hugged herself. “But <i>why?</i>” she cried plaintively. “Why should they kill </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">a little baby?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He is Drogo’s son, and the crones say he will be the stallion who mounts the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">world. It was prophesied. Better to kill the child than to risk his fury when he grows </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">to manhood.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The child kicked inside her, as if he had heard. Dany remembered the story </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Viserys had told her, of what the Usurper’s dogs had done to Rhaegar’s children. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">His son had been a babe as well, yet they had ripped him from his mother’s breast </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and dashed his head against a wall. That was the way of men. “They must not hurt </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">my son!” she cried. “I will order my <i>khas</i> to keep him safe, and Drogo’s bloodriders </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="78" height="22" font="2">will—” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah held her by the shoulders. “A bloodrider dies with his  <i>khal</i>.  You </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">know that, child. They will take you to Vaes Dothrak, to the crones, that is the last </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">duty they owe him in life . . . when it is done, they will join Drogo in the night </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">lands.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany did not want to go back to Vaes Dothrak and live the rest of her life </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">among those terrible old women, yet she knew that the knight spoke the truth. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Drogo had been more than her sun-and-stars; he had been the shield that kept her </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">safe. “I will not leave him,” she said  stubbornly, miserably. She took his hand </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">again. “I will not.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A stirring at the tent flap made Dany turn her head. Mirri Maz Duur entered, </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bowing low. Days on the march, trailing behind the <i>khalasar</i>, had left her limping </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and haggard, with blistered and bleeding feet and hollows under her eyes. Behind </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her came Qotho and Haggo, carrying the godswife’s chest between them. When the </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bloodriders caught sight of Drogo’s wound, the chest slipped from Haggo’s fingers </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and crashed to the floor of the tent, and Qotho swore an oath so foul it seared the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="37" height="22" font="2">air. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Mirri Maz Duur studied Drogo, her face still and dead. “The wound has </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">festered.” </text>

<page number="566" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“This is your work,  <i>maegi</i>,” Qotho said. Haggo laid his fist across Mirri’s </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cheek with a meaty smack that drove her to the ground. Then he kicked her where </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="79" height="22" font="2">she lay. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="258" height="22" font="2">“<i>Stop it!</i>” Dany screamed. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Qotho pulled Haggo away, saying, “Kicks are too merciful for a <i>maegi</i>. Take </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her outside. We will stake her to the earth, to be the mount of every passing man. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">And when they are done with her, the dogs will use her as well. Weasels will tear </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">out her entrails and carrion crows feast upon her eyes. The flies off the river shall </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lay their eggs in her womb and drink pus from the ruins of her breasts. . .” He dug </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">iron-hard fingers into the soft, wobbly flesh under the godswife’s arm and hauled </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">her to her feet. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="458" height="22" font="2">“No,” Dany said. “I will not have her harmed.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Qotho’s lips skinned back from his crooked brown teeth in a terrible mockery </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of a smile. “No? You say me <i>no</i>? Better you should pray that we do not stake you </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">out beside your <i>maegi</i>. You did this, as much as the other.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah stepped between them, loosening his longsword in its scabbard. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="675" height="22" font="2">“Rein in your tongue, bloodrider. The princess is still your <i>khaleesi</i>. “ </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Only while the blood-of-my-blood still lives,” Qotho told the knight. “When </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">he dies, she is nothing.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany felt a tightness inside her. “Before I was <i>khaleesi</i>, I was the blood of the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="373" height="22" font="2">dragon. Ser Jorah, summon my <i>khas</i>.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” said Qotho. “We will go. For now. . . <i>Khaleesi</i>.  “Haggo followed him </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="235" height="22" font="2">from the tent, scowling. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That one means you no good, Princess,” Mormont said. “The Dothraki say a </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">man and his bloodriders share one life, and Qotho sees it ending. A dead man is </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">beyond fear.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“No one has died,” Dany said. “Ser Jorah, I may have need of your blade. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Best go don your armor.” She was more frightened than she dared admit, even to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">herself. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="561" height="22" font="2">The knight bowed. “As you say.” He strode from the tent. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany turned back to Mirri Maz Duur. The woman’s eyes were wary. “So you </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="271" height="22" font="2">have saved me once more.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="536" height="22" font="2">“And now you must save him,” Dany said. “Please. . .” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“You do not ask a slave,” Mirri replied sharply, “you tell her.” She went to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Drogo burning on his mat, and gazed long at his wound. “Ask or tell, it makes no </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">matter. He is beyond a healer’s skills.” The  <i>khal</i>’s  eyes were closed. She opened </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="735" height="22" font="2">one with her fingers. “He has been dulling the hurt with milk of the poppy.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="225" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Dany admitted. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“I made him a poultice of firepod and sting-me-not and bound it in a </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">lambskin.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It burned, he said. He tore it off. The herbwomen made him a new one, wet </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="146" height="22" font="2">and soothing.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It burned, yes. There is great healing magic in fire, even your hairless men </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="118" height="22" font="2">know that.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Make him another poultice,” Dany begged. “This time I will make certain he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">wears it.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The time for that is past, my lady,” Mirri said. “All I can do now is ease the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dark road before him, so he might ride painless to the night lands. He will be gone </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="134" height="22" font="2">by morning.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her words were a knife through Dany’s breast. What had she ever done to </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">make the gods so cruel? She had finally found a safe place, had finally tasted love </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and hope. She was finally going home. And now to lose it all. . . “No,” she pleaded. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Save him, and I will free you, I swear it. You must know a way. . . some magic, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">some. . .” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied Daenerys through eyes as </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">black as night. “There is a spell.” Her voice was quiet, scarcely more than a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">whisper. “But it is hard, lady, and dark. Some would say that death is cleaner. I </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for the lesson. My teacher was a </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">bloodmage from the Shadow Lands.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="565" height="22" font="2">Dany went cold all over. “Then you truly are a <i>maegi</i> . . .” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Am I?” Mirri Maz Duur smiled. “Only a  <i>maegi</i>  can save your rider now, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">Silver Lady.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="241" height="22" font="2">“Is there no other way?” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="118" height="22" font="2">“No other.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="357" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo gave a shuddering gasp. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Do it,” Dany blurted. She must not be afraid; she was the blood of the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="202" height="22" font="2">dragon. “Save him.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="2">“There is a price,” the godswife warned her. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="453" height="22" font="2">“You’ll have gold, horses, whatever you like.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“It is not a matter of gold or horses. This is bloodmagic, lady. Only death may </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">pay for life.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Death?” Dany wrapped her arms around herself protectively, rocked back </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and forth on her heels. “My death?” She told herself she would die for him, if she </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">must. She was the blood of the dragon, she would not be afraid. Her brother </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="414" height="22" font="2">Rhaegar had died for the woman he loved. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="598" height="22" font="2">“No,” Mirri Maz Duur promised. “Not your death, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="343" height="22" font="2">Dany trembled with relief. “Do it.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The  <i>maegi</i>  nodded solemnly. “As you speak, so it shall be done. Call your </text>
</page>
<page number="568" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">servants.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Khal Drogo writhed feebly as Rakharo and Quaro lowered him into the bath. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“No,” he muttered, “no. Must ride.” Once in the water, all the strength seemed to </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="158" height="22" font="2">leak out of him. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Bring his horse,” Mirri Maz Duur commanded, and so it was done. Jhogo led </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the  great red stallion into the tent. When the animal caught the scent of death, he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="687" height="22" font="2">screamed and reared, rolling his eyes. It took three men to subdue him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="436" height="22" font="2">“What do you mean to do?” Dany asked her. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="554" height="22" font="2">“We need the blood,” Mirri answered. “That is the way.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jhogo  edged back, his hand on his  <i>arakh</i>.  He was a youth of sixteen years, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">whip-thin, fearless, quick to laugh, with the faint shadow of his first mustachio on </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his upper lip. He fell to his knees before her. “<i>Khaleesi</i>, “he pleaded, “you must not </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="365" height="22" font="2">do this thing. Let me kill this <i>maegi</i>.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="434" height="22" font="2">“Kill her and you kill your <i>khal</i>,” Dany said. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="466" height="22" font="2">“This is bloodmagic,” he said. “It is forbidden.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I am  <i>khaleesi</i>,  and I say it is not forbidden. In Vaes Dothrak, Khal Drogo </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slew a stallion and I ate his heart, to give our son strength and courage. This is the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="177" height="22" font="2">same. The same.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The stallion kicked and reared as Rakharo, Quaro, and Aggo pulled him close </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to the tub where the <i>khal</i> floated like one already dead, pus and blood seeping from </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">his wound to stain the bathwaters. Mirri Maz Duur chanted words in a tongue that </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Dany did not know, and a knife appeared in her hand. Dany never saw where it </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">came from. It looked old; hammered red bronze, leaf-shaped, its blade covered with </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ancient glyphs. The <i>maegi</i> drew it across the stallion’s throat, under the noble head, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the horse screamed and shuddered as the blood poured out of him in a red rush. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He would have collapsed, but the men of her  <i>khas</i>  held him up. “Strength of the </text>

<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">touch the dead flesh, yet afraid to let go as well. <i>Only a horse</i>, Dany thought. If she </text>

<text top="722" left="108" width="422" height="22" font="2">“Am I truly your princess?” she asked him. </text>

<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>arakh</i>  rising. It  caught Quaro low under the arm, the bright sharp steel biting up </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Qotho whirled, cursing. The  <i>arakh</i>  moved so fast that Quaro’s blood flew </text>

<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah’s face, and held it quivering for an instant as Qotho howled in fury. The </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Qotho danced backward,  <i>arakh</i>  whirling around his head in a shining blur, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">flickering out like lightning as the knight came on in a rush. Ser Jorah parried as </text>

<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">four <i>arakhs</i> and as many arms. She heard the crunch of sword on mail, saw sparks </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fly as the long curved blade glanced off a gauntlet. Suddenly it was Mormont </text>

<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">limping. Qotho screamed taunts at him, calling him a craven, a milk man, a eunuch </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">in an iron suit. “You die now!” he promised,  <i>arakh</i>  shivering through the red </text>

<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Mormont grunted, stumbled. Dany felt a sharp pain in her belly, a wetness on </text>

<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">It was enough. Ser Jorah brought his longsword down with all the strength left </text>

<text top="538" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A passing septon was looking at her askance. “Here’s the best place to find </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">pigeon,” Arya told him as she brushed herself off and picked up her fallen stick </text>
<text top="593" left="54" width="529" height="22" font="2">sword. “They come for the crumbs.” He hurried away. </text>
<text top="621" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She tied the pigeon to her belt and started down the street. A man was pushing </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a load of tarts by on a two-wheeled cart; the smells sang of blueberries and lemons </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and apricots. Her stomach made a hollow rumbly noise. “Could I have one?” she </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">heard herself say. “A lemon, or. . . or any kind.” </text>
<text top="731" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The pushcart man looked her up and down. Plainly he did not like what he </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">saw. “Three coppers.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya tapped her wooden sword against the side of her boot. “I’ll trade you a </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="208" height="22" font="2">fat pigeon,” she said. </text>
<text top="842" left="108" width="529" height="22" font="2">“The Others take your pigeon,” the pushcart man said. </text>
<text top="869" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The tarts were still warm from the oven. The smells were making her mouth </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">water, but she  did not have three coppers. . . or one. She gave the pushcart man a </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">look, remembering what Syrio had told her about <i>seeing</i>. He was short, with a little </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">round belly, and when he moved he seemed to favor his left leg a little. She was just </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thinking that if she snatched a tart and ran he would never be able to catch her when </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he said, “You be keepin’ your filthy hands off. The gold cloaks know how to deal </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="428" height="22" font="2">with thieving little gutter rats, that they do.” </text>
<text top="1063" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya glanced warily behind her. Two of the City Watch were standing at the </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mouth of an alley. Their cloaks hung almost to the ground, the heavy wool dyed a </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rich gold; their mail and boots and gloves were black. One wore a longsword at his </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hip, the other an iron cudgel. With a last wistful glance at the tarts, Arya edged back </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">from the cart and hurried off. The gold cloaks had not been paying her any special </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">attention, but the sight of them tied her stomach in knots. Arya had been staying as </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">far from the castle as she could get, yet even from a distance she could see  the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">heads rotting atop the high red walls. Flocks of crows squabbled noisily over each </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">head, thick as flies. The talk in Flea Bottom was that the gold cloaks had thrown in </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with the Lannisters, their commander raised to a lord, with lands on the Trident and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">a seat on the king’s council. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She had also heard other things, scary things, things that made no sense to her. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Some said her father had murdered King Robert and been slain in turn by Lord </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Renly. Others insisted that <i>Renly</i> had killed the king in a drunken quarrel between </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brothers. Why else should he have fled in the night like a common thief? One story </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">said the king had been killed by a boar while hunting, another that he’d died <i>eating</i> </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a boar, stuffing himself so full that he’d ruptured at the table. No, the king had died </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at table, others said, but only because Varys the Spider poisoned him. No, it had </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been the <i>queen</i> who poisoned him. No, he had died of a pox. No, he had choked on </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">a fish bone. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">One thing all the stories agreed on: King Robert was dead. The bells in the </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">seven towers of the Great Sept of Baelor had tolled for a day and a night, the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">thunder of their grief rolling across the city in a bronze tide. They only rang the </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="605" height="22" font="2">bells like that for the death of a king, a tanner’s boy told Arya. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">All she wanted was to go home, but leaving King’s Landing was not so easy </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">as she had hoped. Talk of war was on every lip, and gold cloaks were as thick on </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the city walls as fleas on. . . well, her, for one. She had been sleeping in Flea </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Bottom, on rooftops and in stables, wherever she could find a place to lie down, and </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">it hadn’t taken her long to learn that the district was well named. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Every day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">seven city gates in turn. The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">closed and barred. The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out. Those who were </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">allowed to leave left by the King’s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down from the roof of an inn by the King’s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">and carriages, forcing riders to open their saddlebags, and questioning everyone </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="250" height="22" font="2">who tried to pass on foot. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sometimes she thought about swimming the river, but the Blackwater Rush </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">was wide and deep, and everyone agreed that its currents were wicked and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="710" height="22" font="2">treacherous. She had no coin to pay a ferryman or take passage on a ship. </text>
</page>
<page number="575" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Her lord father had taught her never to steal, but it was growing harder to </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">remember why. If she did not get out soon, she would have to take her chances with </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the gold cloaks. She hadn’t gone hungry much since she learned to knock down </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">birds with her stick sword, but she feared so much pigeon was making her sick. A </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="531" height="22" font="2">couple she’d eaten raw, before she found Flea Bottom. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">In the Bottom there were pot-shops along the alleys where huge tubs of stew </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">had been simmering for years, and you could trade half your bird for a heel of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">yesterday’s bread and a “bowl o’ brown,” and they’d even stick the other half in the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fire and crisp it up for you, so long as you plucked the feathers yourself. Arya </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">would have given anything for a cup of milk and a lemon cake, but the brown </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wasn’t so bad. It usually had barley in it, and chunks of carrot and onion and turnip, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and sometimes even apple, with a film of grease swimming on top. Mostly she tried </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="619" height="22" font="2">not to think about the meat. Once she had gotten a piece of fish. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The only thing was, the pot-shops were never empty, and even as she bolted </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">down her food, Arya could feel them watching. Some of them stared at her boots or </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her cloak, and she knew what they were thinking. With others, she could almost feel </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">their eyes crawling under her leathers; she  <i>didn’t</i>  know what they were thinking, </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and that scared her even more. A couple times, she was followed out into the alleys </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="547" height="22" font="2">and chased, but so far no one had been able to catch her. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The silver bracelet she’d hoped to sell had been stolen her first night out of the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">castle, along with her bundle of good clothes, snatched while she slept in a burnt-</text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">out house off Pig Alley. All they left her was the cloak she had been huddled in, the </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">leathers on her back, her wooden practice sword. . . and Needle. She’d been lying </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on top of Needle, or else it would have been gone too; it was worth more than all </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the rest together. Since then Arya had taken to walking around with her cloak </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">draped over her right arm, to conceal the blade at her hip. The wooden sword she </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">carried in her left hand, out where everybody could see it, to scare off robbers, but </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">there were men in the pot-shops who wouldn’t have been scared off if she’d had a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">battle-axe. It was enough to make her lose her taste for pigeon and stale bread. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="613" height="22" font="2">Often as not, she went to bed hungry rather than risk the stares. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Once she was outside the city, she would find berries to pick, or orchards she </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">might raid for apples and cherries. Arya remembered seeing some from the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">kingsroad on the journey south. And she could dig for roots in the forest, even run </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down some rabbits. In the city, the only things to run down were rats and cats and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scrawny dogs. The potshops would give you a fistful of coppers for a litter of pups, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="491" height="22" font="2">she’d heard, but she didn’t like to think about that. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Down below the Street of Flour was a maze of twisting alleys and cross </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">streets. Arya scrambled through the crowds, trying to put distance between her and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the gold cloaks. She had learned to keep to the center of the street. Sometimes she </text>

<page number="576" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had to dodge wagons and horses, but at least you could see them coming. If you </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">walked near the buildings, people grabbed you. In some alleys you couldn’t help </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="741" height="22" font="2">but brush against the walls; the buildings leaned in so close they almost met. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A whooping gang of small children went running past, chasing a rolling hoop. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Arya stared at them with resentment, remembering the times she’d played at hoops </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with Bran and Jon and their baby brother Rickon. She wondered how big Rickon </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">had grown, and whether Bran was sad. She would have given anything if Jon had </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">been here to call her “little sister” and muss her hair. Not that it needed mussing. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She’d seen her reflection in puddles, and she didn’t think hair got any more mussed </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="99" height="22" font="2">than hers. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She had tried talking to the children she saw in the street, hoping to make a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">friend who would give her a place to sleep, but she must have talked wrong or </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">something. The little ones only looked at her with quick, wary eyes and ran away if </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">she came too close. Their big brothers and sisters asked questions Arya couldn’t </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">answer, called her names, and tried to steal from her. Only yesterday, a scrawny </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">barefoot girl twice her age had knocked her down and tried to pull the boots off her </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">feet, but Arya gave her a  <i>crack</i>  on her ear with her stick sword that sent her off </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">sobbing and bleeding. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stick. It made her think of the sea. Maybe <i>that</i> was the way out. Old Nan used to tell </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. She decided to visit the riverfront. It was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="739" height="22" font="2">on the way to the Mud Gate anyway, and she hadn’t checked that one today. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gold cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">as looked at her. Half the stalls were empty, and it seemed to her that there were </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">fewer ships at dock than she remembered. Out on the Blackwater, three of the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">king’s war galleys moved in formation, gold-painted hulls splitting the water as </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">their oars rose and fell. Arya watched them for a bit, then began to make her way </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="152" height="22" font="2">along the river. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">When she saw the guardsmen on the third pier, in grey woolen cloaks trimmed </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with white satin, her heart almost stopped in her chest. The sight of Winterfell’s </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">colors brought tears to her eyes. Behind them, a sleek three-banked trading galley </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">rocked at her moorings. Arya could not read the name painted on  the hull; the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">words were strange, Myrish, Braavosi, perhaps even High Valyrian. She grabbed a </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="734" height="22" font="2">passing longshoreman by the sleeve. “Please,” she said, “what ship is this?” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="490" height="22" font="2">“She’s the <i>Wind Witch</i>, out of Myr,” the man said. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“She’s  <i>still here</i>,” Arya blurted. The longshoreman gave her a queer look, </text>
</page>
<page number="577" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">shrugged, and walked away. Arya ran toward the pier. The <i>Wind Witch</i> was the ship </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Father had hired to take her home. . . still waiting! She’d imagined it had sailed ages </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="47" height="22" font="2">ago. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Two of the guardsmen were dicing together while the third walked rounds, his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">hand on the pommel of his sword. Ashamed to let them see her crying like a baby, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="683" height="22" font="2">she stopped to rub at her eyes. Her eyes her eyes her eyes, why did. . .  </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="448" height="22" font="4"><i>Look with your eyes</i>, she heard Syrio whisper. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya looked. She knew all of her father’s men. The three in the grey cloaks </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were strangers. “You,” the one walking rounds called out. “What do you want here, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="460" height="22" font="2">boy?” The other two looked up from their dice. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">It was all Arya could do not to bolt and run, but she knew that if she did, they </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">would be after her at once. She made herself walk closer. They were looking for a </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">girl, but he thought she was a boy. She’d <i>be</i> a boy, then. “Want to buy a pigeon?” </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">She showed him the dead bird. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="375" height="22" font="2">“Get out of here,” the guardsman said. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Arya did as he told her. She did not have to pretend to be frightened. Behind </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="356" height="22" font="2">her, the men went back to their dice. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">She could not have said how she got back to Flea Bottom, but she was </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">breathing hard by the time she reached the narrow crooked unpaved streets between </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the hills. The Bottom had a stench to it, a stink of pigsties and stables and tanner’s </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">sheds, mixed in with the sour smell of winesinks and cheap whorehouses. Arya </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">wound her way through the maze dully. It was not until she caught a whiff of </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bubbling brown coming through a pot-shop door that she realized her pigeon was </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gone. It must have slipped from her belt as she ran, or someone had stolen it and </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she’d never noticed. For a moment she wanted to cry again. She’d have to walk all </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="642" height="22" font="2">the way back to the Street of Flour to find another one that plump. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="377" height="22" font="2">Far across the city, bells began to ring. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="697" height="22" font="2">Arya glanced up, listening, wondering what the ringing meant this time. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="538" height="22" font="2">“What’s this now?” a fat man called from the pot-shop. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="552" height="22" font="2">“The bells again, gods ha’mercy,” wailed an old woman. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A red-haired whore in a wisp of painted silk pushed open a second-story </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">window. “Is it the boy king that’s died now?” she shouted down, leaning out over </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the street. “Ah, that’s a boy for you, they never last long.” As she laughed, a naked </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man slid his arms around her from behind, biting her neck and rubbing the heavy </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">white breasts that hung loose beneath her shift. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“Stupid slut,” the fat man shouted up. “The king’s not dead, that’s only </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">summoning bells. One tower tolling. When the king dies, they ring every bell in the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">city.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Here, quit your biting, or I’ll ring <i>your</i> bells,” the woman in the window said </text>

<page number="578" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to the man behind her, pushing him off with an elbow. “So who is it died, if not the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="70" height="22" font="2">king?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="408" height="22" font="2">“It’s a summoning,” the fat man repeated. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Two boys close to Arya’s age scampered past, splashing through a puddle. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">The old woman cursed them, but they kept right on going. Other people were </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">moving too, heading up the hill to see what the noise was about. Arya ran after the </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">slower boy. “Where you going?” she shouted when she was right behind him. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="213" height="22" font="2">“What’s happening?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He glanced back without slowing. “The gold cloaks is carryin’ him to the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="61" height="22" font="2">sept.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="329" height="22" font="2">“Who?” she yelled, running hard. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="528" height="22" font="2">“The <i>Hand</i>! They’ll be taking his head off, Buu says.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A passing wagon had left a deep rut in the street. The boy leapt over, but Arya </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">never saw it. She tripped and fell, face first, scraping her knee open on a stone and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">smashing her fingers when her hands hit the hard-packed earth. Needle tangled </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">between her legs. She sobbed as she struggled to her knees. The thumb of her left </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">hand was covered with blood. When she sucked on it, she saw that half the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">thumbnail was gone, ripped off in her fall. Her hands throbbed, and her knee was all </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">bloody too. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Make way!</i>” someone shouted from the cross street. “<i>Make way for my lords </i></text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="4"><i>of Redwyne!</i>” It was all Arya could do to get out of the road before they ran her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">down, four guardsmen on huge horses, pounding past at a gallop. They wore </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">checked cloaks, blue-and-burgundy. Behind them, two young lordlings rode side by </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">side on a pair of chestnut mares alike as peas in a pod. Arya had seen them in the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bailey a hundred times; the Redwyne twins, Ser Horas and Ser Hobber, homely </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">youths with orange hair and square, freckled faces. Sansa and Jeyne Poole used to </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">call them Ser Horror and Ser Slobber, and giggle whenever they caught sight of </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="353" height="22" font="2">them. They did not look funny now. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Everyone was moving in the same direction, all in a hurry to see what the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ringing was all about. The bells seemed louder now, clanging, calling. Arya joined </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the stream of people. Her thumb hurt so bad where the nail had broken that it was </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">all she could do not to cry. She bit her lip as she limped along, listening to the </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="258" height="22" font="2">excited voices around her. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="739" height="22" font="2">“—the King’s Hand, Lord Stark. They’re carrying him up to Baelor’s Sept.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="224" height="22" font="2">“I heard he was dead.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Soon enough, soon enough. Here, I got me a silver stag says they lop his </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="102" height="22" font="2">head off.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="369" height="22" font="2">“Past time, the traitor.” The man spat. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya struggled to find a voice. “He <i>never</i> —” she started, but she was only a </text>

<page number="579" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="349" height="22" font="2">child and they talked right over her. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Fool! </i>They ain’t neither going to lop him. Since when do they knick traitors </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="310" height="22" font="2">on the steps of the Great Sept?” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Well, they don’t mean to anoint him no knight. I heard it was Stark killed old </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">King Robert. Slit his throat in the woods, and when they found him, he stood there </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="661" height="22" font="2">cool as you please and said it was some old boar did for His Grace.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Ah, that’s not true, it was his own brother did him, that Renly, him with his </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">gold antlers.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You shut your lying mouth, woman. You don’t know what you’re saying, his </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">lordship’s a fine true man.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">By the time they reached the Street of the Sisters, they were packed in </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shoulder to shoulder. Arya let the human current carry her along, up to the top of </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Visenya’s Hill. The white marble plaza was a solid mass of people, all yammering </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">excitedly at each other and straining to get closer to the Great Sept of Baelor. The </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">bells were very loud here. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Arya squirmed through the press, ducking between the legs of horses and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">clutching tight to her sword stick. From the middle of the crowd, all she could see </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were arms and legs and stomachs, and the seven slender towers of the sept looming </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">overhead. She spotted a wood wagon and thought to climb up on the back where </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she might be able to see, but others had the same idea. The teamster cursed at them </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="432" height="22" font="2">and drove them off with a crack of his whip. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Arya grew frantic. Forcing her way to the front of the crowd, she was shoved </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">up against the stone of a plinth. She looked up at Baelor the Blessed, the septon </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">king. Sliding her stick sword through her belt, Arya began to climb. Her broken </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">thumbnail left smears of blood on the painted marble, but she made it up, and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="412" height="22" font="2">wedged herself in between the king’s feet. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="337" height="22" font="2">That was when she saw her father. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Eddard stood on the High Septon’s pulpit outside the doors of the sept, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">supported between two of the gold cloaks. He was dressed in a rich grey velvet </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">doublet with a white wolf sewn on the front in beads, and a grey wool cloak </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">trimmed with fur, but he was thinner than Arya had ever seen him, his long face </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">drawn with pain. He was not standing so much as being held up; the cast over his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="309" height="22" font="2">broken leg was grey and rotten. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The High Septon himself stood behind him, a squat man, grey with age and </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ponderously fat, wearing long white robes and an immense crown of spun gold and </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="639" height="22" font="2">crystal that wreathed his head with rainbows whenever he moved. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Clustered around the doors of the sept, in front of the raised marble pulpit, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">were a knot of knights and high lords. Joffrey was prominent among them, his </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raiment all crimson, silk and satin patterned with prancing stags and roaring lions, a </text>
</page>
<page number="580" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gold crown on his head. His queen mother stood beside him in a black mourning </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gown slashed with crimson, a veil of black diamonds in her hair. Arya recognized </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Hound, wearing a snowy white cloak over his dark grey armor, with four of the </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard around him. She saw Varys the eunuch gliding among the lords in soft </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">slippers and a patterned damask robe, and she thought the short man with the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">silvery cape and pointed beard might be the one who had once fought a duel for </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">Mother. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And there in their midst was Sansa, dressed in sky-blue silk, with her long </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">auburn hair washed and curled and silver bracelets on her wrists. Arya scowled, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="666" height="22" font="2">wondering what her sister was doing here, why she looked so happy. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A long line of gold-cloaked spearmen held back the crowd, commanded by a </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">stout man in elaborate armor, all black lacquer and gold filigree. His cloak had the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="2">metallic shimmer of true cloth-of-gold. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When the bell ceased to toll, a quiet slowly settled across the great plaza, and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her father lifted his head and began to speak, his voice so thin and weak she could </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">scarcely make him out. People behind her began to shout out, “<i>What?</i>” and </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">“<i>Louder!</i>” The man in the black-and-gold armor stepped up behind Father and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">prodded him sharply. <i>You leave him alone!</i> Arya wanted to shout, but she knew no </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">one would listen. She chewed her lip. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Her father raised his voice and began again. “I am Eddard Stark, Lord of </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Winterfell and Hand of the King,” he said more loudly, his voice carrying across </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the plaza, “and I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of gods and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">men.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“<i>No</i>,” Arya whimpered. Below her, the crowd began to scream and shout. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="740" height="22" font="2">Taunts and obscenities filled the air. Sansa had hidden her face in her hands. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. “I betrayed the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert,” he shouted. “I swore to defend </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and protect his children, yet before his blood was cold, I plotted to  depose and </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">murder his son and seize the throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Beloved and the Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the one true heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the gods, Lord of the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="452" height="22" font="2">Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A stone came sailing out of the crowd. Arya cried out as she saw her father </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hit. The gold cloaks kept him from falling. Blood ran down his face from a deep </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gash across his forehead. More stones followed. One struck the guard to Father’s </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">left. Another went clanging off the breastplate of the knight in the black-and-gold </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">armor. Two of the Kingsguard stepped in front of Joffrey and the queen, protecting </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="231" height="22" font="2">them with their shields. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her hand slid beneath her cloak and found Needle in its sheath. She tightened </text>

<page number="581" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">her fingers around the grip, squeezing as hard as she had ever squeezed anything. </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="685" height="22" font="4"><i>Please, gods, keep him safe</i>, she prayed. <i>Don’t let them hurt my father</i>. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother. “As  we sin, so do we </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">suffer,” he intoned, in a deep swelling voice much louder than Father’s. “This man </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and men, here in this holy place.” </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Rainbows danced around his head as he lifted his hands in entreaty. “The gods are </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">just, yet Blessed Baelor taught us that they are also merciful. What shall be done </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="300" height="22" font="2">with this traitor, Your Grace?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">A thousand voices were screaming, but Arya never heard them. Prince </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="828" height="22" font="2">Joffrey. . . no,  <i>King</i>  Joffrey. . . stepped out from behind the shields of his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Kingsguard. “My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the black, and Lady Sansa </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">has begged mercy for her father.” He looked straight at Sansa then, and <i>smiled</i>, and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">for a moment Arya thought that the gods had heard her prayer, until Joffrey turned </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">back to the crowd and said, “But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="763" height="22" font="2">am your king, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The crowd roared, and Arya felt the statue of Baelor rock as they surged </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">against it. The High Septon clutched at the king’s cape, and Varys came rushing </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">over waving his arms, and even the queen was saying something to him, but Joffrey </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">shook his head. Lords and knights moved aside as he stepped through, tall and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fleshless, a skeleton in iron mail, the King’s Justice. Dimly, as if from far off, Arya </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">heard her sister scream. Sansa had fallen to her knees, sobbing hysterically. Ser Ilyn </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="367" height="22" font="2">Payne climbed the steps of the pulpit. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Arya wriggled between Baelor’s feet and threw herself into the crowd, </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">drawing Needle. She landed on a man in a butcher’s apron, knocking him to the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ground. Immediately someone slammed into her back and she almost went down </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">herself. Bodies closed in around her, stumbling and pushing, trampling on the poor </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">butcher. Arya slashed at them with Needle. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">High atop the pulpit, Ser Ilyn Payne gestured and the knight in black-and-gold </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gave a command. The gold cloaks flung Lord Eddard to the marble, with his head </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">and chest out over the edge. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Here, you!” an angry voice shouted at Arya, but she bowled past, shoving </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">people aside, squirming between them, slamming into anyone in her way. A hand </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fumbled at her leg and she hacked at it, kicked at shins. A woman stumbled and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Arya ran up her back, cutting to both sides, but it was no good, <i>no good</i>, there were </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">too many people, no sooner did she make a hole than it closed again. Someone </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="547" height="22" font="2">buffeted her aside. She could still hear Sansa screaming. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Ilyn drew a two-handed greatsword from the scabbard on his back. As he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lifted the blade above his head, sunlight seemed to ripple and dance down the dark </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">metal, glinting off an edge sharper than any razor. <i>Ice</i>, she thought, <i>he has Ice!</i> Her </text>

<page number="582" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="421" height="22" font="2">tears streamed down her face, blinding her. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And then a hand shot out of the press and closed round her arm like a wolf </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">trap, so hard that Needle went flying from her hand. Arya was wrenched off her </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">feet. She would have fallen if he hadn’t held her up, as easy as if she were a doll. A </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">face pressed close to hers, long black hair and tangled beard and rotten teeth. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="408" height="22" font="2">“<i>Don’t look!</i>” a thick voice snarled at her. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="287" height="22" font="2">“I. . . I. . . I. . .” Arya sobbed. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The old man shook her so hard her teeth rattled. “Shut your mouth and close </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">your eyes,  <i>boy</i>.” Dimly, as if from far away, she heard a. . . a  <i>noise</i> . . . a soft </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sighing sound, as if a million people had let out their breath at once. The old man’s </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">fingers dug into her arm, stiff as iron. “Look at me. Yes, that’s the way of it, at <i>me</i>.” </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="498" height="22" font="2">Sour wine perfumed his breath. “Remember, <i>boy</i>?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It was the smell that did it. Arya saw the matted greasy hair, the patched, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dusty black cloak that covered his twisted shoulders, the hard black eyes squinting </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="768" height="22" font="2">at her. And she remembered the black brother who had come to visit her father. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Know me now, do you? There’s a bright boy.” He spat. “They’re done here. </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">You’ll be coming with me, and you’ll be keeping your mouth shut.” When she </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="614" height="22" font="2">started to reply, he shook her again, even harder. “<i>Shut</i>, I said.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The plaza was beginning to empty. The press dissolved around them as people </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">drifted back to their lives. But Arya’s life was gone. Numb,  she trailed along </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">beside. . . <i>Yoren, yes, his name is Yoren</i>. She did not recall him finding Needle, until </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="617" height="22" font="2">he handed the sword back to her. “Hope you can use that, boy.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="237" height="22" font="2">“I’m not—” she started. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He shoved her into a doorway, thrust dirty fingers through her hair, and gave </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="796" height="22" font="2">it a twist, yanking her head back. “—not a smart <i>boy</i>, that what you mean to say?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="319" height="22" font="2">He had a knife in his other hand. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">As the blade flashed toward her face, Arya threw herself backward, kicking </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wildly, wrenching her head from side to side, but he had her by the hair, so <i>strong</i>, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="666" height="22" font="2">she could feel her scalp tearing, and on her lips the salt taste of tears. </text>

<text top="318" left="176" width="702" height="22" font="2">Bran watched them from the balcony of Maester Luwin’s turret, </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">listening to them grunt and strain and curse as they swung their staves and wooden </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">swords. The yard was alive to the <i>clack</i> of wood on wood, punctuated all too often </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">by <i>thwacks</i> and yowls of pain when a blow struck leather or flesh. Ser Rodrik strode </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">among the boys, face reddening beneath his white whiskers, muttering at them one </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and all. Bran had never seen the old knight look so fierce. “No,” he kept saying. </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="145" height="22" font="2">“No. No. No.” </text>
<text top="511" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“They don’t fight very well,” Bran said dubiously. He scratched Summer idly </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">behind the ears as the direwolf tore at a haunch of meat. Bones crunched between </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="93" height="22" font="2">his teeth. </text>
<text top="593" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“For a certainty,” Maester Luwin agreed with a deep sigh. The maester was </text>
<text top="621" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">peering through his big Myrish lens tube, measuring shadows and noting the </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">position of the comet that hung low in the morning sky. “Yet given time. . . Ser </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Rodrik has the truth of it, we need men to walk the walls. Your lord father took the </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">cream of his guard to King’s Landing, and your brother took the rest, along with all </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the likely lads for leagues around. Many will not come back to us, and we must </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">needs find the men to take their places.” </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran stared resentfully at the sweating boys below. “If I still had my legs, I </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could beat them all.” He remembered the last time he’d held a sword in his hand, </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">when the king had come to Winterfell. It was only a wooden sword, yet he’d </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knocked Prince Tommen down half a hundred times. “Ser Rodrik should teach me </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to use a poleaxe. If I had a poleaxe with a big long haft, Hodor could be my legs. </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="313" height="22" font="2">We could be a knight together.” </text>
<text top="952" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I think that. . . unlikely,” Maester Luwin said. “Bran, when a man fights, his </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="432" height="22" font="2">arms and legs and thoughts must be as one.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Below in the yard, Ser Rodrik was yelling. “You fight like a goose. He pecks </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">you and you peck him harder.  <i>Parry</i>! Block the blow. Goose fighting will not </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">suffice. If those were real swords, the first peck would take your arm off!” One of </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the other boys laughed, and the old knight rounded on him. “You laugh. You. Now </text>

<page number="584" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="405" height="22" font="2">that is gall. <i>You</i> fight like a hedgehog. . .” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“There was a knight once who couldn’t see,” Bran said stubbornly, as Ser </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Rodrik went on below. “Old Nan told me about him. He had a long staff with </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="778" height="22" font="2">blades at both ends and he could spin it in his hands and chop two men at once.” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Symeon Star-Eyes,” Luwin said as he marked numbers in a book. “When he </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lost his eyes, he put star sapphires in the empty sockets, or so the singers claim. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Bran, that is only a story, like the tales of Florian the Fool. A fable from the Age of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Heroes.” The master <i>tsk</i>ed. “You must put these dreams aside, they will only break </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">your heart.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The mention of dreams reminded him. “I dreamed about the crow again last </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">night. The one with three eyes. He flew into my bedchamber and told me to come </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with him, so I did. We went down to the crypts. Father was there, and we talked. He </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="98" height="22" font="2">was sad.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="519" height="22" font="2">“And why was that?” Luwin peered through his tube. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“It was something to do about Jon, I think.” The dream had been deeply </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">disturbing, more so than any of the other crow dreams. “Hodor won’t go down into </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">the crypts.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The maester had only been half listening, Bran could tell. He lifted his eye </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="414" height="22" font="2">from the tube, blinking. “Hodor won’t. . .” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Go down into the crypts. When I woke, I told him to take me down, to see if </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Father was truly there. At first he didn’t know what I was saying, but I got him to </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the steps by telling him to go here and go there, only then he wouldn’t go down. He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">just stood on the top step and said ‘Hodor,’ like he was scared of the dark, but I <i>had</i> </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a torch. It made me so mad I almost gave him a swat in the head, like Old Nan is </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">always doing.” He saw the way the maester was frowning and hurriedly added, “I </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="159" height="22" font="2">didn’t, though.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="481" height="22" font="2">“Good. Hodor is a man, not a mule to be beaten.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“In the dream I flew down with the crow, but I can’t do that when I’m </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="242" height="22" font="2">awake,” Bran explained. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="484" height="22" font="2">“Why would you want to go down to the crypts?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="315" height="22" font="2">“I told you. To look for Father.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The maester tugged at the chain around his neck, as he often did when he was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">uncomfortable. “Bran, sweet child, one day Lord Eddard will sit below in stone, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beside his father and his father’s father and all the Starks back to the old Kings in </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the North. . . but that will not be for many years, gods be good. Your father is a </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="754" height="22" font="2">prisoner of the queen in King’s Landing. You will not find him in the crypts.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="406" height="22" font="2">“He was there last night. I talked to him.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Stubborn boy,” the maester sighed, setting his book aside. “Would you like </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">to go see?” </text>
</page>
<page number="585" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="757" height="22" font="2">“I can’t. Hodor won’t go, and the steps are too narrow and twisty for Dancer.” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="364" height="22" font="2">“I believe I can solve that difficulty.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">In place of Hodor, the wildling woman Osha was summoned. She was tall and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tough and uncomplaining, willing to go wherever she was commanded. “I lived my </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="788" height="22" font="2">life beyond the Wall, a hole in the ground won’t fret me none, m’lords,” she said. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Summer, come,” Bran called as she lifted him in wiry-strong arms. The </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">direwolf left his bone and followed as Osha carried Bran across the yard and down </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the spiral steps to the cold vault under the earth. Maester Luwin went ahead with a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">torch. Bran did not even mind—too badly—that she carried him in her arms and not </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">on her back. Ser Rodrik had ordered Osha’s chain struck off, since she had served </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">faithfully and well since she had been at Winterfell. She still wore the heavy iron </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shackles  around her ankles—a sign that she was not yet wholly trusted—but they </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="447" height="22" font="2">did not hinder her sure strides down the steps. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Bran could not recall the last time he had been in the crypts. It had been </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>before</i>,  for certain. When he was little, he used to play down here with Robb and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="186" height="22" font="2">Jon and his sisters. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He wished they were here now; the vault might not have seemed so dark and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">scary. Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">sniffed the chill dead air. He bared his teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">golden in the light of the maester’s torch. Even Osha, hard as old iron, seemed </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">uncomfortable. “Grim folk, by the look of them,” she said as she eyed the long row </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="384" height="22" font="2">of granite Starks on their stone thrones. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“They were the Kings of Winter,” Bran whispered. Somehow it felt wrong to </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">talk too loudly in this place. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Osha smiled. “Winter’s got no king. If you’d seen it, you’d know that, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="142" height="22" font="2">summer boy.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“They were the Kings in the North for thousands of years,” Maester Luwin </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">said, lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet. Others </text>

<text top="887" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">across their laps. “Hard men for a hard time. Come.” He strode briskly down the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">vault, past the procession of stone pillars and the endless carved figures. A tongue </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">of flame trailed back from the upraised torch as he went. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told him </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">once that there were other levels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker where </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the older kings were buried. It would not do to lose the light. Summer refused to </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">move from the steps, even when Osha followed the torch, Bran in her arms. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Do you recall your history, Bran?” the maester said as they walked. “Tell </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="505" height="22" font="2">Osha who they were and what they did, if you can.” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made them come alive. “That one is Jon </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Stark. When the sea raiders landed in the east, he drove them out and built the castle </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">at White Harbor. His son was Rickard Stark, not my father’s father but another </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Rickard, he took the Neck away from the Marsh King and married his daughter. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Theon Stark’s the real thin one with the long hair and the skinny beard. They called </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him the ‘Hungry Wolf,’ because he was always at war. That’s a Brandon, the tall </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">one with the dreamy face, he was Brandon the Shipwright, because he loved the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sea. His tomb is empty. He tried to sail west across the Sunset Sea and was never </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">seen again. His son was Brandon the Burner, because he put the torch to all his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">father’s ships in grief. There’s Rodrik Stark, who won Bear Island in a wrestling </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">match and gave it to the Mormonts. And that’s Torrhen Stark, the King Who Knelt. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He was the last King in the North and the first Lord of Winterfell, after he yielded </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">to Aegon the Conqueror. Oh, there, he’s Cregan Stark. He fought with Prince </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said he’d never faced a finer swordsman.” They </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">were almost at the end now, and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him. “And </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">there’s my grandfather, Lord Rickard, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys. His </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">daughter Lyanna and his son Brandon are in the tombs beside him. Not me, another </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Brandon, my father’s brother. They’re not supposed to have statues, that’s only for </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">the lords and the kings, but my father loved them so much he had them done.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="345" height="22" font="2">“The maid’s a fair one,” Osha said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Robert was betrothed to marry her, but Prince Rhaegar carried her off and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">raped her,” Bran explained. “Robert fought a war to win her back. He killed </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Rhaegar on the Trident with his hammer, but Lyanna died and he never got her </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">back at all.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="583" height="22" font="2">“A sad tale,” said Osha, “but those empty holes are sadder.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Lord Eddard’s tomb, for when his time comes,” Maester Luwin said. “Is this </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="482" height="22" font="2">where you saw your father in your dream, Bran?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” The memory made him shiver. He looked around the vault uneasily, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the hairs on the back of his neck bristling. Had he heard a noise? Was there </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="149" height="22" font="2">someone here? </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin stepped toward the open sepulchre, torch in hand. “As you </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">see, he’s not here. Nor will he be, for many a year. Dreams are only dreams, child.” </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He thrust his arm into the blackness inside the tomb, as into the mouth of some </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">great beast. “Do you see? It’s quite empt—” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="365" height="22" font="2">The darkness sprang at him, snarling. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran saw eyes like green fire, a flash of teeth, fur as black as the pit around </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">them. Maester Luwin yelled and threw up his hands. The torch went flying from his </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fingers, caromed off the stone face of Brandon Stark, and tumbled to the statue’s </text>
</page>
<page number="587" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">feet, the flames licking up his legs. In the drunken shifting torchlight, they saw </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Luwin struggling with the direwolf, beating at his muzzle with one hand while the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">jaws closed on the other. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="269" height="22" font="2">“<i>Summer!</i>” Bran screamed. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">And Summer came, shooting from the dimness behind them, a leaping </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">shadow. He slammed into Shaggydog and knocked him back, and the two </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">direwolves rolled over and over in a tangle of grey and black fur, snapping and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">biting at each other, while Maester Luwin struggled to his knees, his arm torn and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bloody. Osha propped Bran up against Lord Rickard’s stone wolf as she hurried to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">assist the maester. In the light of the guttering torch, shadow wolves twenty feet tall </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="274" height="22" font="2">fought on the wall and roof. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Shaggy,” a small voice called. When Bran looked up, his little brother was </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">standing in the mouth of Father’s tomb. With one final snap at Summer’s face, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon’s side. “You let my father be,” Rickon </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="328" height="22" font="2">warned Luwin. “You let him be.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="463" height="22" font="2">“Rickon,” Bran said softly. “Father’s not here.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Yes he is. I saw him.” Tears glistened on Rickon’s face. “I saw him last </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="72" height="22" font="2">night.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="204" height="22" font="2">“In your dream. . .?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Rickon nodded. “You leave him. You leave him be. He’s coming home now, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">like he promised. He’s coming home.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran had never seen Maester Luwin took so uncertain before. Blood dripped </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down his arm where Shaggydog had shredded the wool of his sleeve and the flesh </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beneath. “Osha, the torch,” he said, biting through his pain, and she snatched it up </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">before it went out. Soot stains blackened both legs of his uncle’s likeness. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="811" height="22" font="2">“That. . . that <i>beast</i>,” Luwin went on, “is supposed to be chained up in the kennels.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Rickon patted Shaggydog’s muzzle, damp with blood. “I let him loose. He </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="437" height="22" font="2">doesn’t like chains.” He licked at his fingers. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="555" height="22" font="2">“Rickon,” Bran said, “would you like to come with me?” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="191" height="22" font="2">“No. I like it here.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="262" height="22" font="2">“It’s dark here. And cold.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="411" height="22" font="2">“I’m not afraid. I have to wait for Father.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You can wait with me,” Bran said. “We’ll wait together, you and me and our </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wolves.” Both of the direwolves were licking wounds now, and would bear close </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="100" height="22" font="2">watching. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Bran,” the maester said firmly, “I know you mean well, but Shaggydog is too </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">wild to run loose. I’m the third man he’s savaged. Give him the freedom of the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">castle and it’s only a question of time before he kills someone. The truth is hard, but </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="461" height="22" font="2">the wolf has to be chained, or . . .” He hesitated </text>
</page>
<page number="588" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">. . . <i>or killed</i>, Bran thought, but what he said was, “He was not made for </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="445" height="22" font="2">chains. We will wait in your tower, all of us.” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="466" height="22" font="2">“That is quite impossible,” Maester Luwin said. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Osha grinned. “The boy’s the lordling here, as I recall.” She handed Luwin </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">back his torch and scooped Bran up into her arms again. “The maester’s tower it is.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="262" height="22" font="2">“Will you come, Rickon?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His brother nodded. “If Shaggy comes too,” he said, running after Osha and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Bran, and there was nothing Maester Luwin could do but follow, keeping a wary </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">eye on the wolves. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin’s turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he ever found anything. Tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs, rows of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">stoppered jars lined the shelves, candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">furniture, the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod by the terrace door, star charts </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hung from the walls, shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes, papers, quills, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and pots of inks were everywhere, and all of it was spotted with droppings from the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ravens in the rafters. Their strident <i>quorks</i> drifted down from above as Osha washed </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and cleaned and bandaged the maester’s wounds, under Luwin’s terse instruction. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“This is folly,” the small grey man said while she dabbed at the wolf bites with a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">stinging ointment. “I agree that it is odd that both you boys dreamed the same </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dream, yet when you stop to consider it, it’s only natural. You miss your lord father, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and you know that he is a captive. Fear can fever a man’s mind and give him queer </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="479" height="22" font="2">thoughts. Rickon is too young to comprehend—” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I’m four now,” Rickon said. He was peeking through the lens tube at the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">gargoyles on the First Keep. The direwolves sat on opposite sides of the large round </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="493" height="22" font="2">room, licking their wounds and gnawing on bones. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“—too young, and—<i>ooh</i>, seven hells, that burns, no, don’t stop, more. Too </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">young, as I say, but you, Bran, you’re old enough to know that dreams are only </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="92" height="22" font="2">dreams.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Some are, some aren’t.” Osha poured pale red firemilk into a long gash. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Luwin gasped. “The children of the forest could tell you a thing or two about </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="113" height="22" font="2">dreaming.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Tears were streaming down the maester’s face, yet he shook his head </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">doggedly. “The children. . . live only in dreams. Now. Dead and gone. Enough, </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">that’s enough. Now the bandages. Pads and then wrap, and make it tight, I’ll be </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">bleeding.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Old Nan says the children knew the songs of the trees, that they could fly like </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">birds and swim like fish and talk to the animals,” Bran said. “She says that they </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">made music so beautiful that it made you cry like a little baby just to hear it.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“And all this they did with magic,” Maester Luwin said, distracted. “I wish </text>
</page>
<page number="589" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they were here now. A spell would heal my arm less painfully, and they could talk </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">to Shaggydog and tell him not to bite.” He gave the big black wolf an angry glance </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">out of the corner of his eye. “Take a lesson, Bran. The man who trusts in spells is </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dueling with a glass sword. As the children did. Here, let me show you something.” </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He stood abruptly, crossed the room, and returned with a green jar in his good hand. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Have a look at these,” he said as he pulled the stopper and shook out a handful of </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="239" height="22" font="2">shiny black arrowheads. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran picked one up. “It’s made of glass.” Curious, Rickon drifted closer to </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">peer over the table. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Dragonglass,” Osha named it as she sat down beside Luwin, bandagings in </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">hand. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Obsidian,” Maester Luwin insisted, holding out his wounded arm. “Forged in </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the fires of the gods, far below the earth. The children of the forest hunted with that, </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">thousands of years ago. The children worked no metal. In place of mail, they wore </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">long shirts of woven leaves and bound their legs in bark, so they seemed to melt </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="650" height="22" font="2">into the wood. In place of swords, they carried blades of obsidian.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And still do.” Osha placed soft pads over the bites on the maester’s forearm </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="452" height="22" font="2">and bound them tight with long strips of linen. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Bran held the arrowhead up close. The black glass was slick and shiny. He </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="378" height="22" font="2">thought it beautiful. “Can I keep one?” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="320" height="22" font="2">“As you wish,” the maester said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="528" height="22" font="2">“I want one too,” Rickon said. “I want four. <i>I’m</i> four.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Luwin made him count them out. “Careful, they’re still sharp. Don’t cut </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">yourself.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="559" height="22" font="2">“Tell me about the children,” Bran said. It was important. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="297" height="22" font="2">“What do you wish to know?” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="140" height="22" font="2">“Everything.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“They were people of the Dawn Age, the very first, before kings and kingdoms,” he </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">said. “In those days, there were no castles or holdfasts, no cities, not so much as a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">market town to be found between here and the sea of Dorne. There were no men at </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">all. Only the children of the forest dwelt in the lands we now call the Seven </text>

<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">children even when grown to manhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Slight as they were, the children were </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">quick and graceful. Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows and </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">flying snares. Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whose names are secret. Their wise men were called <i>greenseers</i>, and carved strange </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods. How long the children reigned </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="482" height="22" font="2">here or where they came from, no man can know. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“But some twelve thousand years ago, the First Men appeared from the east, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken. They came with bronze </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">swords and great leathern shields, riding horses. No horse had ever been seen on </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">this side of the narrow sea. No doubt the children were as frightened by the horses </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">as the First Men were by the faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">holdfasts and farms, they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horror-</text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">struck, the children went to war. The old songs say that the greenseers used dark </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">magics  to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering the Arm, but it </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was too late to close the door. The wars went on until the earth ran red with blood </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">of men and children both, but more children than men, for men were bigger and </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stronger, and wood and stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze. Finally </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the wise of both races prevailed, and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small island in the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="269" height="22" font="2">great lake called Gods Eye. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“There they forged the Pact. The First Men were given the coastlands, the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">high plains and bright meadows, the mountains and bogs, but the deep woods were </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">to remain forever the children’s, and no more weirwoods were to be put to the axe </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">anywhere in the realm. So the gods might bear witness to the signing, every tree on </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the island was given a face, and afterward, the sacred order of green men was </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="432" height="22" font="2">formed to keep watch over the Isle of Faces. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The Pact began four thousand years of friendship between men and children. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">In time, the First Men even put aside the gods they had brought with them, and took </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">up the worship of the secret gods of the wood. The signing of the Pact ended the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="417" height="22" font="2">Dawn Age, and began the Age of Heroes.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Bran’s fist curled around the shiny black arrowhead. “But the children of the </text>

<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Here, they are,” said Osha, as she bit off the end of the last bandage with her </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">teeth. “North of the Wall, things are different. That’s where the children went, and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="345" height="22" font="2">the giants, and the other old races.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin sighed. “Woman, by rights you ought to be dead or in chains. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">The Starks have treated you more gently than you deserve. It is unkind to repay </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">them for their kindness by filling the boys’ heads with folly.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="553" height="22" font="2">“Tell me where they went,” Bran said. “I want to know.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="257" height="22" font="2">“Me too,” Rickon echoed. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oh, very well,” Luwin muttered. “So long as the kingdoms of the First Men </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">held sway, the Pact endured, all through the Age of Heroes and the Long Night and </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">the birth of the Seven Kingdoms, yet finally there came a time, many centuries </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">later, when other peoples crossed the narrow sea. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The Andals were the first, a race of tall, fair-haired warriors who came with </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">steel and fire and the seven-pointed star of the new gods painted on their chests. </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The wars lasted hundreds of years, but in the end the six southron kingdoms all fell </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">before them. Only here, where the King in the North threw back every army that </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tried to cross the Neck, did the rule of the First Men endure. The Andals burnt out </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the weirwood groves, hacked down the faces, slaughtered the children where they </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">found them, and everywhere proclaimed the triumph of the Seven over the old gods. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="286" height="22" font="2">So the children fled north—” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="235" height="22" font="2">Summer began to howl. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin broke off, startled. When Shaggydog bounded to his feet and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">added his voice to his brother’s, dread clutched at Bran’s heart. “<i>It’s coming</i>,” he </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">whispered, with the certainty of despair. He had known it since last night, he </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">realized, since the crow had led him down into the crypts to say farewell. He had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">known it, but he had not believed. He had wanted Maester Luwin to be right. <i>The </i></text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="413" height="22" font="4"><i>crow</i>, he thought, <i>the three-eyed crow</i> . . .  </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The howling stopped as suddenly as it had begun. Summer padded across the </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">tower floor to Shaggydog, and began to lick at a mat of bloody fur on the back of </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="594" height="22" font="2">his brother’s neck. From the window came a flutter of wings. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">A raven landed on the grey stone sill, opened its beak, and gave a harsh, </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="246" height="22" font="2">raucous rattle of distress. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Rickon began to cry. His arrowheads fell from his hand one by one and </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">clattered on the floor. Bran pulled him close and hugged him. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin stared at the black bird as if it were a scorpion with feathers. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">He rose, slow as a sleepwalker, and moved to the window. When he whistled, the </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">raven hopped onto his bandaged forearm. There was dried blood on its wings. “A </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">hawk,” Luwin murmured, “perhaps an owl. Poor thing, a wonder it got through.” </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">He took the letter from its leg. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Bran found himself shivering as the maester unrolled the paper. “What is it?” </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="406" height="22" font="2">he said, holding his brother all the harder. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You know what it is, boy,” Osha said, not unkindly. She put her hand on his </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">head. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Maester Luwin looked up at them numbly, a small grey man with blood on the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sleeve of his grey wool robe and tears in his bright grey eyes. “My lords,” he said to </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">the sons, in a voice gone hoarse and shrunken, “we. . . we shall need to find a </text>

<text top="262" left="91" width="781" height="22" font="2">n the tower room at the heart of Maegor’s Holdfast, Sansa gave herself to the </text>

<text top="318" left="145" width="730" height="22" font="2">She drew the curtains around her bed, slept, woke weeping, and slept </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">again. When she could not sleep she lay under her blankets shivering with grief. </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Servants came and went, bringing meals, but the sight of food was more than she </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">could bear. The dishes piled up on the table beneath her window, untouched and </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="483" height="22" font="2">spoiling, until the servants took them away again. </text>
<text top="456" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sometimes her sleep was leaden and dreamless, and she woke from it more </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">tired than when she had closed her eyes. Yet those were the best times, for when </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">she dreamed, she dreamed of Father. Waking or sleeping, she saw him, saw the </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">gold cloaks fling him down, saw Ser Ilyn striding forward, unsheathing Ice from the </text>
<text top="566" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">scabbard on his back, saw the moment. . . the moment when. . . she had wanted to </text>

<text top="621" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">fallen to her knees, yet somehow she could not turn her head, and all the people </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">were screaming and shouting, and her prince had smiled at her, he’d  <i>smiled</i>  and </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she’d felt safe, but only for a heartbeat, until he said those words, and her father’s </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">legs. . . that was what she remembered, his legs, the way they’d  <i>jerked</i>  when Ser </text>

<text top="759" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="4"><i>Perhaps I will die too</i>, she told herself, and the thought did not seem so </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">terrible to her. If  she flung herself from the window, she could put an end to her </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">suffering, and in the years to come the singers would write songs of her grief. Her </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">body would lie on the stones below, broken and innocent, shaming all those who </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had betrayed her. Sansa went so far as to cross the bedchamber and throw open the </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="756" height="22" font="2">shutters. . . but then her courage left her, and she ran back to her bed, sobbing. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The serving girls tried to talk to her when they brought her meals, but she </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">never answered them. Once Grand Maester Pycelle came with a box of flasks and </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bottles, to ask if she was ill. He felt her brow, made her undress, and touched her all </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">over while her bedmaid held her down. When he left he gave her a potion of </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">honeywater and herbs and told her to drink a swallow every night. She drank it all </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="329" height="22" font="2">right then and went back to sleep. </text>
<text top="1090" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She dreamt of footsteps on the tower stair, an ominous scraping of leather on </text>

<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">do was huddle behind her door and listen, trembling, as he came closer and closer. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">It was Ser Ilyn Payne, she knew, coming for her with Ice in his hand, coming to </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">take her head. There was no place to run, no place to hide, no way to bar the door. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Finally the footsteps stopped and she knew he was just outside, standing there silent </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with his dead eyes and his long pocked face. That was when she realized she was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">naked. She crouched down, trying to cover herself with her hands, as her door </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="759" height="22" font="2">began to swing open, creaking, the point of the greatsword poking through. . .  </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">She woke murmuring, “Please, please, I’ll be good, I’ll be  <i>good</i>,  please </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="356" height="22" font="2">don’t,” but there was no one to hear. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When they finally came for her in truth, Sansa never heard their footsteps. It </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was Joffrey who opened her door, not Ser Ilyn but the boy who had been her prince. </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">She was in bed, curled up tight, her curtains drawn, and she could not have said if it </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was noon or midnight. The first thing she heard was the slam of the door. Then her </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bed hangings were yanked back, and she threw up a hand against the sudden light </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="316" height="22" font="2">and saw them standing over her. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“You will attend me in court this afternoon,” Joffrey said. “See that you bathe </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and dress as befits my betrothed.” Sandor Clegane stood at his shoulder in a plain </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">brown doublet and green mantle, his burned face hideous in the morning light. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="737" height="22" font="2">Behind them were two knights of the Kingsguard in long white satin cloaks. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa drew her blanket up to her chin to cover herself. “No,” she whimpered, </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="244" height="22" font="2">“please. . . leave me be.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“If you won’t rise and dress yourself, my Hound will do it for you,” Joffrey </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="51" height="22" font="2">said. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="283" height="22" font="2">“I beg of you, my prince. . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="399" height="22" font="2">“I’m king now. Dog, get her out of bed.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane scooped her up around the waist and lifted her off the </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">featherbed as she struggled feebly. Her blanket fell to the floor. Underneath she had </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">only a thin bedgown to cover her nakedness. “Do as you’re bid, child,” Clegane </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="637" height="22" font="2">said. “Dress.” He pushed her toward her wardrobe, almost gently. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sansa backed away from them. “I did as the queen asked, I wrote the letters, I </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wrote what she told me. You promised you’d be merciful. Please, let me go home. I </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">won’t do any treason, I’ll be good, I swear it, I don’t have traitor’s blood, I <i>don’t</i>. I </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">only want to go home.” Remembering her courtesies, she lowered her head. “As it </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“It does <i>not</i> please me,” Joffrey said. “Mother says I’m still to marry you, so </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="335" height="22" font="2">you’ll stay here, and you’ll obey.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I don’t  <i>want</i>  to marry you,” Sansa wailed. “You chopped off my father’s </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He was a traitor. I never promised to spare him, only that I’d be merciful, and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">I was. If he hadn’t been your father, I would have had him torn or flayed, but I gave </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="191" height="22" font="2">him a clean death.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Sansa stared at him, seeing him for the first time. He was wearing a padded </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">crimson doublet patterned with lions and a cloth-of-gold cape with a high collar that </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">framed his face. She wondered how she could ever have thought him handsome. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">His lips were as soft and red as the worms you found after a rain, and his eyes were </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="426" height="22" font="2">vain and cruel. “I hate you,” she whispered. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">King  Joffrey’s face hardened. “My mother tells me that it isn’t fitting that a </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="391" height="22" font="2">king should strike his wife. Ser Meryn.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The knight was on her before she could think, yanking back her hand as she </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tried to shield her face and backhanding her across the ear with a gloved fist. Sansa </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">did not remember failing, yet the next she knew she was sprawled on one knee </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">amongst the rushes. Her head was ringing. Ser Meryn Trant stood over her, with </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="443" height="22" font="2">blood on the knuckles of his white silk glove. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="597" height="22" font="2">“Will you obey now, or shall I have him chastise you again?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa’s ear felt numb. She touched it, and her fingertips came away wet and </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="426" height="22" font="2">red. “I. . . as. . . as you command, my lord.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“<i>Your Grace</i>,” Joffrey corrected her. “I shall look for you in court.” He turned </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="85" height="22" font="2">and left. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Meryn and Ser Arys followed him out, but Sandor Clegane lingered long </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">enough to yank her roughly to her feet. “Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="160" height="22" font="2">what he wants.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="455" height="22" font="2">“What. . . what does he want? Please, tell me.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“He wants you to smile and smell sweet and be his lady love,” the Hound </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rasped. “He wants to hear you recite all your pretty little words the way the septa </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">taught you. He wants you to love him. . . and fear him.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">After he was gone, Sansa sank back onto the rushes, staring at the wall until </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">two of her bedmaids crept timidly into the chamber. “I will need hot water for my </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bath, please,” she told them, “and perfume, and some powder to hide this bruise.” </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The right side of her face was swollen and beginning to ache, but she knew Joffrey </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="306" height="22" font="2">would want her to be beautiful. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The hot water made her think of Winterfell, and she took strength from that. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She had not washed since the day her father died, and she was startled at how filthy </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the water became. Her maids sluiced the blood off her face, scrubbed the dirt from </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her back, washed her hair and brushed it out until it sprang back in thick auburn </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">curls. Sansa did not speak to them, except to give them commands; they were </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lannister servants, not her own, and she did not trust them. When the time came to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">dress, she chose the green silk gown that she had worn to the tourney. She recalled </text>

<page number="595" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">how gallant Joff had been to her that night at the feast. Perhaps it would make him </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="436" height="22" font="2">remember as well, and treat her more gently. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">She drank a glass of buttermilk and nibbled at some sweet biscuits  as she </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">waited, to settle her stomach. It was midday when Ser Meryn returned. He had </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">donned his white armor; a shirt of enameled scales chased with gold, a tall helm </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">with a golden sunburst crest, greaves and gorget and gauntlet and boots of gleaming </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">plate, a heavy wool cloak clasped with a golden lion. His visor had been removed </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">from his helm, to better show his dour face; pouchy bags under his eyes, a wide </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sour mouth, rusty hair spotted with grey. “My lady,” he said, bowing, as if he had </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not beaten her bloody only three hours past. “His Grace has instructed me to escort </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="243" height="22" font="2">you to the throne room.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="508" height="22" font="2">“Did he instruct you to hit me if I refused to come?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Are you refusing to come, my lady?” The look he gave her was without </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="677" height="22" font="2">expression. He did not so much as glance at the bruise he had left her. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">He did not hate her, Sansa realized; neither did he love her. He felt nothing for </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her at all. She was only a. . . a <i>thing</i> to him. “No,” she said, rising. She wanted to </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rage, to hurt him as he’d hurt her, to warn him that when she was queen she would </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have him exiled if he ever dared strike her again. . . but she remembered what the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Hound had told her, so all she said was, “I shall do whatever His Grace </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">commands.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="211" height="22" font="2">“As I do,” he replied. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="469" height="22" font="2">“Yes. . . but you are no true knight, Ser Meryn.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane would have laughed at that, Sansa knew. Other men might </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">have cursed her, warned her to keep silent, even begged for her forgiveness. Ser </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">Meryn Trant did none of these. Ser Meryn Trant simply did not care. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The balcony was deserted save for Sansa. She stood with her head bowed, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">fighting to hold back her tears, while below Joffrey sat on his Iron Throne and </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dispensed what it pleased him to call justice. Nine cases out of ten seemed to bore </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">him; those he allowed his council to handle, squirming  restlessly while Lord </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Baelish, Grand Maester Pycelle, or Queen Cersei resolved the matter. When he did </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">choose to make a ruling, though, not even his queen mother could sway him. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A thief was brought before him and he had Ser Ilyn chop his hand off, right </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">there in court. Two knights came to him with a dispute about some land, and he </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">decreed that they should duel for it on the morrow. “To the  <i>death</i>,” he added. A </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">woman fell to her knees to plead for the head of a man executed as a traitor. She </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had loved him, she said, and she wanted to see him decently buried. “If you loved a </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">traitor, you must be a traitor too,” Joffrey said. Two gold cloaks dragged her off to </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="139" height="22" font="2">the dungeons. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Frog-faced Lord Slynt sat at the end of the council table wearing a black </text>

<page number="596" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">velvet doublet and a shiny cloth-of-gold cape, nodding with approval every time the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">king pronounced a sentence. Sansa stared hard at his ugly face, remembering how </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he had thrown down her father for Ser Ilyn to behead, wishing she could hurt him, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">wishing that some hero would throw him down and cut off his head. But a voice </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">inside her whispered,  <i>There are no heroes</i>,  and she remembered what Lord Petyr </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had said to her, here in this very hall. “Life is not a song, sweetling,” he’d told her. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“You may learn that one day to your  sorrow.”<i>In life, the monsters win</i>,  she told </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">herself, and now it was the Hound’s voice she heard, a cold rasp, metal on stone. </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="595" height="22" font="2">“Save yourself some pain, girl, and give him what he wants.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The last case was a plump tavern singer, accused of making a song that </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ridiculed the late King Robert. Joff commanded them to fetch his woodharp and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ordered him to perform the song for the court. The singer wept and swore he would </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">never sing that song again, but the king insisted. It was sort of a funny song, all </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">about Robert fighting with a pig. The pig was the boar who’d killed him, Sansa </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knew, but in some verses it almost sounded as if he were singing about the queen. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">When the song was done, Joffrey announced that he’d decided to be merciful. The </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">singer could keep either his fingers or his tongue. He would have a day to make his </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="273" height="22" font="2">choice. Janos Slynt nodded. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">That was the final business of the afternoon, Sansa saw with relief, but her </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ordeal was not yet done. When the herald’s voice dismissed the court, she fled the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">balcony,  only to find Joffrey waiting for her at the base of the curving stairs. The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">Hound was with him, and Ser Meryn as well. The young king examined her </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="608" height="22" font="2">critically, top to bottom. “You look much better than you did.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, Your Grace,” Sansa said. Hollow words, but they made him nod </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="105" height="22" font="2">and smile. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Walk with me,” Joffrey commanded, offering her his arm. She had no choice </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">but to take it. The touch of his hand would have thrilled her once; now it made her </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">flesh crawl. “My name day will be here soon,” Joffrey said as they slipped out the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rear of the throne room. “There will be a great feast, and gifts. What are you going </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">to give me?” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="329" height="22" font="2">“I. . . I had not thought, my lord.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“<i>Your Grace</i>,” he said sharply. “You truly are a stupid girl, aren’t you? My </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="165" height="22" font="2">mother says so.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“She  does?” After all that had happened, his words should have lost their </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">power to hurt her, yet somehow they had not. The queen had always been so kind to </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">her. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh, yes. She worries about our children, whether they’ll be stupid like you, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">but I told her not to  trouble herself.” The king gestured, and Ser Meryn opened a </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="144" height="22" font="2">door for them. </text>
</page>
<page number="597" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Thank you, Your Grace,” she murmured. <i>The Hound was right, she thought, </i></text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="4"><i>I am only a little bird, repeating the words they taught me</i>.  The sun had fallen </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="757" height="22" font="2">below the western wall, and the stones of the Red Keep glowed dark as blood. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I’ll get you with child as soon as you’re able,” Joffrey said as he escorted her </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">across the practice yard. “If the first one is stupid, I’ll chop off your head and find a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="643" height="22" font="2">smarter wife. When do you think you’ll be able to have children?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">Sansa could not look at him, he shamed her so. “Septa Mordane says </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="692" height="22" font="2">most. . . most highborn girls have their flowering at twelve or thirteen.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Joffrey nodded. “This way.” He led her into the gatehouse, to the base of the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="344" height="22" font="2">steps that led up to the battlements. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Sansa jerked back away from him, trembling. Suddenly she knew where they </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">were going. “<i>No</i>,” she said, her voice a frightened gasp. “Please, no, don’t make </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="185" height="22" font="2">me, I beg you . . .” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Joffrey pressed his lips together. “I want to show you what happens to </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">traitors.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="471" height="22" font="2">Sansa shook her head wildly. “I won’t. I <i>won’t</i>.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I can have Ser Meryn drag you up,” he said. “You won’t like that. You had </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">better do what I say.” Joffrey reached for her, and Sansa cringed away from him, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="238" height="22" font="2">backing into the Hound. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Do it, girl,” Sandor Clegane told her, pushing her back toward the king. His </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mouth twitched on the burned side of his face and Sansa could almost hear the rest </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="706" height="22" font="2">of it. <i>He’ll have you up there no matter what, so give him what he wants</i>. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She forced herself to take King Joffrey’s hand. The climb was something out </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">of a nightmare; every step was a struggle, as if she were pulling her feet out of </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">ankle-deep mud, and there were more steps than she would have believed, a </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="591" height="22" font="2">thousand thousand steps, and horror waiting on the ramparts. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">From the high battlements of the gatehouse, the whole world spread out below </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them. Sansa could see the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s hill, where her father </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had died. At the other end of the Street of the Sisters stood the fire-blackened ruins </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the Dragonpit. To the west, the swollen red sun was half-hidden behind the Gate </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the Gods. The salt sea was at her back, and to the south was the fish market and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">the docks and the swirling torrent of the Blackwater Rush. And to the north. . .  </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She turned that way, and saw only the city, streets and alleys and hills and </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bottoms and more streets and more alleys and the stone of distant walls. Yet she </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">knew that beyond them was open country, farms and fields and forests, and beyond </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">that, north and north and north again, stood Winterfell. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“What are you looking at?” Joffrey said. “This is what I wanted you to see, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="115" height="22" font="2">right here.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">A thick stone parapet protected the outer edge of the rampart, reaching as high </text>

<page number="598" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">as Sansa’s chin, with crenellations cut into it every five feet for archers. The heads </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">were mounted between the crenels, along the top of the wall, impaled on iron spikes </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">so they faced out over the city. Sansa had noted them the moment she’d stepped out </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">onto the wallwalk, but the river and the bustling streets and the setting sun were </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">ever so much prettier.  <i>He can make me look at the heads</i>,  she told herself,  <i>but he </i></text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="241" height="22" font="4"><i>can’t make me see them</i>. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“This one is your father,” he said. “This one here. Dog, turn it around so she </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="136" height="22" font="2">can see him.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Sandor Clegane took the head by the hair and turned it. The severed head had </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">been dipped in tar to preserve it longer. Sansa looked at it calmly, not seeing it at </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">all. It did not really look like Lord Eddard, she thought; it did not even look <i>real</i>. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="302" height="22" font="2">“How long do I have to look?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Joffrey seemed disappointed. “Do you want to see the rest?” There was a long </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="129" height="22" font="2">row of them. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="253" height="22" font="2">“If it please Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Joffrey marched her down the wallwalk, past a dozen more heads and two </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">empty spikes. “I’m saving those for my uncle Stannis and my uncle Renly,” he </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">explained. The other heads had been dead and mounted much longer than her </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">father. Despite the tar, most were long past being recognizable. The king pointed to </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">one and said, “That’s your septa there,” but Sansa could not even have told that it </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">was a woman. The jaw had rotted off her face, and birds had eaten one ear and most </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">of a cheek. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Sansa had wondered what had happened to Septa Mordane, although she </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">supposed she had known all along. “Why did you kill  <i>her</i>?” she asked. “She was </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="141" height="22" font="2">godsworn. . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“She  was a traitor.” Joffrey looked pouty; somehow she was upsetting him. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“You haven’t said what you mean to give me for my name day. Maybe I should </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="489" height="22" font="2">give you something instead, would you like that?” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="377" height="22" font="2">“If it please you, my lord,” Sansa said. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When he smiled, she knew he was mocking her. “Your brother is a traitor too, </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">you know.” He turned Septa Mordane’s head back around. “I remember your </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brother from Winterfell. My dog called him the lord of the wooden sword. Didn’t </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">you, dog?” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="431" height="22" font="2">“Did I?” the Hound replied. “I don’t recall.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Joffrey gave a petulant shrug. “Your brother defeated my uncle Jaime. My </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mother says it was treachery and deceit. She wept when she heard. Women are all </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">weak, even her, though she pretends she isn’t. She says we need to stay in King’s </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A kind of madness took over her then, and she heard herself say, “Maybe my </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="319" height="22" font="2">brother will give me <i>your</i> head.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Joffrey scowled. “You must never mock me like that. A true wife does not </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">mock her lord. Ser Meryn, teach her.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">This time the knight grasped her beneath the jaw and held her head still as he </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">struck her. He hit her twice, left to right, and harder, right to left. Her lip split and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="587" height="22" font="2">blood ran down her chin, to mingle with the salt of her tears. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You shouldn’t be crying all the time,” Joffrey told her. “You’re more pretty </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="275" height="22" font="2">when you smile and laugh.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Sansa made herself smile, afraid that he would have Ser Meryn hit her again if </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">she did not, but it was no good, the king still shook his head. “Wipe off the blood, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="181" height="22" font="2">you’re all messy.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The outer parapet came up to her chin, but along the inner edge of the walk </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was nothing, nothing but a long plunge to the bailey seventy or eighty feet below. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">All it would take was a shove, she told herself. He was standing right there, right </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="4"><i>there</i>, smirking at her with those fat wormlips. You could do it, she told herself. <i>You </i></text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="4"><i>could. Do it right now</i>.  It wouldn’t even matter if she went over with him. It </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">wouldn’t matter at all. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Here, girl.” Sandor Clegane knelt before her, <i>between</i> her and Joffrey. With a </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">delicacy surprising in such a big man, he dabbed at the blood welling from her </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="110" height="22" font="2">broken lip. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The moment was gone. Sansa lowered her eyes. “Thank you,” she said when </text>

<text top="373" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tiny with distance, but even from afar, she saw that it was painted red. She walked </text>

<text top="584" left="54" width="726" height="22" font="2">dream. She floated, serene and at peace, on a black sea that knew no shore. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">After a time—a night, a day, a year, she could not say—she woke again. The </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tent was dark, its silken walls flapping like wings when the wind gusted outside. </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">This time Dany did not attempt to rise. “Irri,” she called, “Jhiqui. Doreah.” They </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">were there at once. “My throat is dry,” she said, “so dry,” and they brought her </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">water. It was warm and flat, yet Dany drank it eagerly, and sent Jhiqui for more. Irri </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">dampened a soft cloth and stroked her brow. “I have been sick,” Dany said. The </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dothraki girl nodded. “How long?” The cloth was soothing, but Irri seemed so sad, </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">it frightened her. “<i>Long</i>,” she whispered. When Jhiqui returned with more water, </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Mirri Maz Duur came with her, eyes heavy from sleep. “Drink,” she said, lifting </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Dany’s head to the cup once more, but this time it was only wine. Sweet, sweet </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">wine. Dany drank, and lay back, listening to the soft sound of her own breathing. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She could feel the heaviness in her limbs, as sleep crept in to fill her up once more. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“Bring me. . .”  she murmured, her voice slurred and drowsy. “Bring. . . I want to </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">hold. . .” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="563" height="22" font="2">“Yes?” the <i>maegi</i> asked. “What is it you wish, <i>Khaleesi</i>?” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Bring me. . . egg. . . dragon’s egg. . . please. . .”  Her lashes turned to lead, </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="387" height="22" font="2">and she was too weary to hold them up. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When she woke the third time, a shaft of golden sunlight was pouring through </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the smoke hole of the tent, and her arms were wrapped around a dragon’s egg. It </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">was the pale one, its scales the color of butter cream, veined with whorls of gold </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and bronze, and Dany could feel the heat of it. Beneath her bedsilks, a fine sheen of </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">perspiration covered her bare skin.  <i>Dragondew</i>,  she thought. Her fingers trailed </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">lightly across the surface of the shell, tracing the wisps of gold, and deep in the </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stone she felt something twist and stretch in response. It did not frighten her. All her </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">fear was gone, burned away. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Dany touched her brow. Under the film of sweat, her skin was cool to the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">touch, her fever gone. She made herself sit. There was a moment of dizziness, and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the deep ache between her thighs. Yet she felt strong. Her maids came running at </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the sound of her voice. “Water,” she told them, “a flagon of water, cold as you can </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="323" height="22" font="2">find it. And fruit, I think. Dates.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="236" height="22" font="2">“As you say, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I want Ser Jorah,” she said, standing. Jhiqui brought a sandsilk robe and </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">draped it over her shoulders. “And a warm bath, and Mirri Maz Duur, and. . .” </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Memory came back to her all at once, and she faltered. “Khal Drogo,” she forced </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="561" height="22" font="2">herself to say, watching their faces with dread. “Is he—?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The <i>khal</i> lives,” Irri answered quietly. . . yet Dany saw a darkness in her eyes </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when she said the words, and no sooner had she spoken than she rushed away to </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">fetch water. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="324" height="22" font="2">She turned to Doreah. “Tell me.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“I. . . I shall bring Ser Jorah,” the Lysene girl said, bowing her head and </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="156" height="22" font="2">fleeing the tent. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jhiqui would have run as well, but Dany caught her by the wrist and held her </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">captive. “What is it? I must know. Drogo. . . and my child.” Why had she not </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="805" height="22" font="2">remembered the child until now? “My son. . . Rhaego. . . where is he? I want him.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her handmaid lowered her eyes. “The boy. . . he did not live, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” Her </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">voice was a frightened whisper. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Dany released her wrist.  <i>My son is dead</i>,  she thought as Jhiqui left the tent. </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">She had known somehow. She had known since she woke the first time to Jhiqui’s </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">tears. No, she had known <i>before</i> she woke. Her dream came back to her, sudden and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">vivid, and she remembered the tall man with the copper skin and long silver-gold </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="256" height="22" font="2">braid, bursting into flame. </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She should weep, she knew, yet her eyes were dry as ash. She had wept in her </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">dream, and the tears had turned to steam on her cheeks.  <i>All the grief has been </i></text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>burned out of me</i>,  she told herself. She felt sad,  and yet. . . she could feel Rhaego </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="417" height="22" font="2">receding from her, as if he had never been. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah and Mirri Maz Duur entered a few moments later, and found Dany </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">standing over the other dragon’s eggs, the two still in their chest. It seemed to her </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">that they felt as hot as the one she had slept with, which was passing strange. “Ser </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Jorah, come here,” she said. She took his hand and placed it on the black egg with </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">the scarlet swirls. “What do you feel?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="521" height="22" font="2">“Shell, hard as rock.” The knight was wary. “Scales.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="83" height="22" font="2">“Heat?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“No.  Cold stone.” He took his hand away. “Princess, are you well? Should </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="288" height="22" font="2">you be up, weak as you are?” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Weak? I am strong, Jorah.” To please him, she reclined on a pile of cushions. </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">“Tell me how my child died.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He never lived, my princess. The women say. . .” He faltered, and Dany saw </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="713" height="22" font="2">how the flesh hung loose on him, and the way he limped when he moved. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="396" height="22" font="2">“Tell me. Tell me what the women say.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="750" height="22" font="2">He turned his face away. His eyes were haunted. “They say the child was. . .” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She waited, but Ser Jorah could not say it. His face grew dark with shame. He </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">looked half a corpse himself. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Monstrous,” Mirri Maz Duur finished for him. The knight was a powerful </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">man, yet Dany understood in that moment that the <i>maegi</i> was stronger, and crueler, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and infinitely more dangerous. “Twisted. I  drew him forth myself. He was scaled </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">like a lizard, blind, with the stub of a tail and small leather wings like the wings of a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">bat. When I touched him, the flesh sloughed off the bone, and inside he was full of </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="676" height="22" font="2">graveworms and the stink of corruption. He had been dead for years.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>Darkness</i>, Dany thought. The terrible darkness sweeping up behind to devour </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her. If she looked back she was lost. “My son was alive and strong when Ser Jorah </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="794" height="22" font="2">carried me into this tent,” she said. “I could feel him kicking, fighting to be born.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“That may be as it may be,” answered Mirri Maz Duur, “yet the creature that </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="740" height="22" font="2">came forth from your womb was as I said. Death was in that tent, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Only shadows,” Ser Jorah husked, but Dany could hear the doubt in his </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="655" height="22" font="2">voice. “I saw, <i>maegi</i>. I saw you, alone, dancing with the shadows. “ </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The grave casts long shadows, Iron Lord,” Mirri said. “Long and dark, and in </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="366" height="22" font="2">the end no light can hold them back.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah had killed her son, Dany knew. He had done what he did for love </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and loyalty, yet he had carried her into a place no living man should go and fed her </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">baby to the darkness. He knew it too; the grey face, the hollow eyes, the limp. “The </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadows have touched you too, Ser Jorah,” she told him. The knight made no reply. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dany turned to the godswife. “You warned me that only death could pay for life. I </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="296" height="22" font="2">thought you meant the horse.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“No,” Mirri Maz Duur said. “That was a lie you told yourself. You knew the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">price.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Had she? Had she? <i>If I look back I am lost</i>. “The price was paid,” Dany said. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“The  horse, my child, Quaro and Qotho, Haggo and Cohollo. The price was paid </text>
</page>
<page number="605" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and paid and paid.” She rose from her cushions. “Where is Khal Drogo? Show him </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to me, godswife, <i>maegi</i>, bloodmage, whatever you are. Show me Khal Drogo. Show </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="371" height="22" font="2">me what I bought with my son’s life.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“As you command, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” the old woman said. “Come, I will take you to </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="60" height="22" font="2">him.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Dany was weaker than she knew. Ser Jorah slipped an arm around her and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="732" height="22" font="2">helped her stand. “Time enough for this later, my princess,” he said quietly. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="337" height="22" font="2">“I would see him now, Ser Jorah.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">After the dimness of the tent, the world outside was blinding bright. The sun </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">burned like molten gold, and the land was seared and empty. Her handmaids waited </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with fruit and wine and water, and Jhogo moved close to help Ser Jorah support her. </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Aggo and Rakharo stood behind. The glare of sun on sand made it hard to see more, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">until Dany raised her hand to shade her eyes. She saw the ashes of a fire, a few </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">score horses milling listlessly and searching for a bite of grass, a scattering of tents </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and bedrolls. A small crowd of children had gathered to watch her, and beyond she </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">glimpsed women going about their work, and withered old men staring at the flat </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">blue sky with tired eyes, swatting feebly at bloodflies. A count might show a </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">hundred people,  no more. Where the other forty thousand had made their camp, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="332" height="22" font="2">only the wind and dust lived now. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="365" height="22" font="2">“Drogo’s <i>khalasar</i> is gone,” she said. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="472" height="22" font="2">“A <i>khal</i> who cannot ride is no <i>khal</i>,” said Jhogo. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“The Dothraki follow only the strong,” Ser Jorah said. “I am sorry, my </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">princess. There was no way to hold them. Ko Pono left first, naming himself Khal </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Pono, and many followed him. Jhaqo was not long to do the same. The rest slipped </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">away night by night, in large bands and small. There are a dozen new <i>khalasars</i> on </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="533" height="22" font="2">the Dothraki sea, where once there was only Drogo’s.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“The old remain,” said Aggo. “The frightened, the weak, and the sick. And we </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="245" height="22" font="2">who swore. We remain.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“They took Khal Drogo’s herds, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Rakharo said. “We were too few </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to stop them. It is the right of the strong  to take from the weak. They took many </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="586" height="22" font="2">slaves as well, the <i>khal</i>’s and yours, yet they left some few.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">“Eroeh?” asked Dany, remembering the frightened child she had saved </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="332" height="22" font="2">outside the city of the Lamb Men. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Mago seized her, who is Khal Jhaqo’s bloodrider now,” said Jhogo. “He </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mounted her high and low and gave her to his <i>khal</i>, and Jhaqo gave her to his other </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="774" height="22" font="2">bloodriders. They were six. When they were done with her, they cut her throat.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="376" height="22" font="2">“It was her fate, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” said Aggo. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="4"><i>If I look back I am lost</i>. “It was a cruel fate,” Dany said, “yet not so cruel as </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Mago’s will be. I promise you that, by the old gods and the new, by the lamb god </text>

<page number="606" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and the horse god and every god that lives. I swear it by the Mother of Mountains </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and the Womb of the World. Before I am done with them, Mago and Ko Jhaqo will </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="400" height="22" font="2">plead for the mercy they showed Eroeh.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">The Dothraki exchanged uncertain glances. “<i>Khaleesi</i>,”  the handmaid Irri </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">explained, as if to a child, “Jhaqo is a <i>khal</i> now, with twenty thousand riders at his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">back.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">She lifted her head. “And I am Daenerys Stormhorn, Daenerys of House </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Targaryen, of the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel and old </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Valyria before them. I am the dragon’s daughter, and I swear to you, these men will </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="452" height="22" font="2">die screaming. Now bring me to Khal Drogo.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="547" height="22" font="2">He was lying on the bare red earth, staring up at the sun. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">A dozen bloodflies had settled on his body, though he did not seem to feel </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">them. Dany brushed them away and knelt beside him. His eyes were wide open but </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">did not see, and she knew at once that he was blind. When she whispered his name, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he did not seem to hear. The wound on his breast was as healed as it would ever be, </text>

<text top="501" left="108" width="541" height="22" font="2">“Why is he out here alone, in the sun?” she asked them. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He seems to like the warmth, Princess,” Ser Jorah said. “His eyes follow the </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sun, though he does not see it. He can walk after a fashion. He will go where you </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">lead him, but no farther. He will eat if you put food in his mouth, drink if you </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="255" height="22" font="2">dribble water on his lips.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany kissed her sun-and-stars gently on the brow, and stood to face Mirri Maz </text>

<text top="694" left="108" width="704" height="22" font="2">“He lives,” said Mirri Maz Duur. “You asked for life. You paid for life.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“This is not life, for one who was as Drogo was. His life was laughter, and </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">meat roasting over a firepit, and a horse between his legs. His life was an <i>arakh</i> in </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his hand and his bells ringing in his hair as he rode to meet an enemy. His life was </text>

<text top="832" left="108" width="310" height="22" font="2">Mirri Maz Duur made no reply. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="462" height="22" font="2">“When will he be as he was?” Dany demanded. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,” said Mirri Maz Duur. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">“When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When your </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will return, and not </text>

<text top="998" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany gestured at Ser Jorah and the others. “Leave us. I would speak with this </text>

<text top="1053" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they were gone. She ached, inside and out, but her fury gave her strength. “You </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="743" height="22" font="2">knew what I was buying, and you knew the price, and yet you let me pay it.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“It was wrong of them to burn my temple,” the heavy, flat-nosed woman said </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“This was no god’s work,” Dany said coldly.  <i>If I look back I am lost</i>.  “You </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="521" height="22" font="2">“I spoke for you,” she said, anguished. “I saved you.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“<i>Saved </i>me?” The Lhazareen woman spat. “Three riders had taken me, not as a </text>

<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">when you rode past. How then did you save me? I saw my god’s house burn, where </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I had healed good men beyond counting. My home they burned as well, and in the </text>

<text top="418" left="54" width="119" height="22" font="2">you saved.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="121" height="22" font="2">“Your life.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Mirri Maz Duur laughed cruelly. “Look to your  <i>khal</i>  and see what life is </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="323" height="22" font="2">worth, when all the rest is gone.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Dany called out for the men of her  <i>khas</i>  and bid them take Mirri Maz Duur </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and bind her hand and foot, but the <i>maegi</i> smiled at her as they carried her off, as if </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they shared a secret. A word, and Dany could have her head off. . . yet then what </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="623" height="22" font="2">would she have? A head? If life was worthless, what was death? </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They led Khal Drogo back to her tent, and Dany commanded them to fill a </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tub, and this time there was no blood in the water. She bathed him herself, washing </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the dirt and the dust from his arms and chest, cleaning his face with a soft cloth, </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">soaping his long black hair and combing the knots and tangles from it till it shone </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">again as she remembered. It was well past dark before she was done, and Dany was </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">exhausted. She stopped for drink and food, but it was all she could do to nibble at a </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fig and keep down a mouthful of water. Sleep would have been a release, but she </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">had slept enough. . . too long, in truth. She owed this night to Drogo, for all the </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="378" height="22" font="2">nights that had been, and yet might be. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The memory of their first ride was with her when she led him out into the </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">darkness, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a man’s life </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">must be done beneath the open sky. She told herself that there were powers stronger </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">than hatred, and spells older and truer than any the  <i>maegi</i>  had learned in Asshai. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The night was black and moonless, but overhead a million stars burned bright. She </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">took that for an omen. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">No soft blanket of grass welcomed them here, only the hard dusty ground, </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bare and strewn with stones. No trees stirred in the wind, and there was no stream to </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">soothe her fears with the gentle music of water. Dany told herself that the stars </text>

<page number="608" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">would be enough. “Remember, Drogo,” she whispered. “Remember our first ride </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">together, the day we wed. Remember the night we made Rhaego, with the <i>khalasar</i> </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">all around us and your eyes on my face. Remember how cool and clean the water </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">was in the Womb of the World. Remember, my sun-and-stars. Remember, and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="186" height="22" font="2">come back to me.” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The birth had left her too raw and torn to take him inside of her, as she would </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">have wanted, but Doreah had taught her other ways. Dany used her hands, her </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">mouth, her breasts. She raked him with her nails and covered him with kisses and </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whispered and prayed and told him stories, and by the end she had bathed him with </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="489" height="22" font="2">her tears. Yet Drogo did not feel, or speak, or rise. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">And when the bleak dawn broke over an empty horizon, Dany knew that he </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was truly lost to her. “When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east,” she said </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">sadly. “When the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When my </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">womb quickens again, and I bear a living child. Then you will return, my sun-and-</text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">stars, and not before.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="4"><i>Never</i>, the darkness cried, <i>never never never</i>. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Inside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">clutched it to her breasts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. <i>If I </i></text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>look back I am lost</i>. It hurt even to walk, and she wanted to sleep, to sleep and not </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="97" height="22" font="2">to dream. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his </text>

<text top="345" left="54" width="433" height="22" font="2">Crakehall was half-obscured by dried blood. </text>
<text top="373" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>One </i>of your sons, Tyrion thought. He took a sip of wine and said not a word, </text>
<text top="400" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">thinking of Jaime. When he lifted his arm, pain shot through his elbow, reminding </text>
<text top="428" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him of his own brief taste of battle. He loved his brother, but he would not have </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="784" height="22" font="2">wanted to be with him in the Whispering Wood for all the gold in Casterly Rock. </text>
<text top="483" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">His lord father’s assembled captains and bannermen had fallen very quiet as </text>
<text top="511" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the courier told his tale. The only sound was the crackle and hiss of the log burning </text>
<text top="538" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">in the hearth at the end of the long, drafty common room. </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">After the  hardships of the long relentless drive south, the prospect of even a </text>

<text top="621" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">not been  <i>this</i>  inn again, with all its memories. His father had set a grueling pace, </text>
<text top="649" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and it had taken its toll. Men wounded in the battle kept up as best they could or </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">were abandoned to fend for themselves. Every morning they left a few more by the </text>

<text top="731" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">collapsed along the way. And every evening a few more deserted, stealing off into </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="548" height="22" font="2">the dusk. Tyrion had been half-tempted to go with them. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He had been upstairs, enjoying the comfort of a featherbed and the warmth of </text>

<text top="842" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">arrived with dire news of Riverrun. So it had all been for nothing. The rush south, </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I would have done the same,” his uncle responded, a good deal more calmly </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">than Tyrion might have. “You have never seen Riverrun, Ser Harys, or you would </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">know that Jaime had little choice in the matter. The castle is situated at the end of </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the point of land where the Tumblestone flows into the Red Fork of the Trident. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The rivers form two sides of a triangle, and when danger threatens, the Tullys open </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">their sluice gates upstream to create a wide moat on the third side, turning Riverrun </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">into an island. The walls rise sheer from the water, and from their towers the </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">defenders have a commanding view of the opposite shores for many leagues </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">around. To cut off all the approaches, a besieger must needs place one camp north </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of the Tumblestone, one south of the Red Fork, and a third between the rivers, west </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="412" height="22" font="2">of the moat. There is no other way, none.” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Kevan speaks truly, my lords,” the courier said. “We’d built palisades of </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">sharpened stakes around the camps, yet it was not enough, not with no warning and </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the rivers cutting us off from each other. They came down on the north camp first. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">No one was expecting an attack. Marq Piper had been raiding our supply trains, but </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">he had no more than fifty men. Ser Jaime had gone out to deal with them the night </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">before. . . well, with what we  <i>thought</i>  was them. We were told the Stark host was </text>

<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And your outriders?” Ser Gregor Clegane’s face might have been hewn from </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">rock. The fire in the hearth gave a somber orange cast to his skin and put deep </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">shadows in the hollows of his eyes. “They saw nothing? They gave you no </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="106" height="22" font="2">warning?” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">The bloodstained messenger shook his head. “Our outriders had been </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">vanishing. Marq Piper’s work, we thought. The ones who did come back had seen </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="96" height="22" font="2">nothing.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“A man who sees nothing has no use for his eyes,” the Mountain declared. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">“Cut them out and give them to your next outrider. Tell him you hope that four eyes </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="704" height="22" font="2">might see better than two. . . and if not, the man after him will have six.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin Lannister turned his face to study Ser Gregor. Tyrion saw a </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">glimmer of gold as the light shone off his father’s pupils, but he could not have said </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">whether the look was one of approval or disgust. Lord Tywin was oft quiet in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">council, preferring to listen before he spoke, a habit Tyrion himself tried to emulate. </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="772" height="22" font="2">Yet this silence was uncharacteristic even for him, and his wine was untouched. </text>

<text top="1025" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The man gave a weary nod. “The Blackfish led the van, cutting down our </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sentries and clearing away the palisades for the main assault. By the time our men </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">knew what was happening, riders were pouring over the ditch banks and galloping </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">through the camp with swords and torches in hand. I was sleeping in the west camp, </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">between the rivers. When we heard the fighting and saw the tents being fired, Lord </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Brax led us to the rafts and we tried to pole across, but the current pushed us </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">downstream and the Tullys started flinging rocks at us with the catapults on their </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">walls. I saw one raft smashed to kindling and three others overturned, men swept </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">into the river and drowned. . . and those who did make it across found the Starks </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">waiting for them on the riverbanks.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Ser Flement Brax wore a silver-and-purple tabard and the look of a man who </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="611" height="22" font="2">cannot comprehend what he has just heard. “My lord father—” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Sorry, my lord,” the messenger said. “Lord Brax was clad in plate-and-mail </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="461" height="22" font="2">when his raft overturned. He was very gallant.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>He was a fool</i>, Tyrion thought, swirling his cup and staring down into the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">winy depths. Crossing a river at night on a crude raft, wearing armor, with an </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">enemy waiting on the other side—if that was gallantry, he would take cowardice </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">every time. He wondered if Lord Brax had felt especially gallant as the weight of </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="412" height="22" font="2">his steel pulled him under the black water. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“The camp between the rivers was overrun as well,” the messenger was </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">saying. “While we were trying to cross, more Starks swept in from the west, two </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">columns of armored horse. I saw Lord Umber’s giant-in-chains  and the Mallister </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">eagle, but it was the boy who led them, with a monstrous wolf running at his side. I </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wasn’t there to see, but it’s said the beast killed four men and ripped apart a dozen </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">horses. Our spearmen formed up a shieldwall and held against their first charge, but </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when the Tullys saw them engaged, they opened the gates of Riverrun and Tytos </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="707" height="22" font="2">Blackwood led a sortie across the drawbridge and took them in the rear.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="361" height="22" font="2">“Gods save us,” Lord Lefford swore. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“Greatjon Umber fired the siege towers we were building, and Lord </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Blackwood found Ser Edmure Tully in chains among the other captives, and made </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">off with them all. Our south camp was under the command of Ser Forley Prester. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">He retreated in good order when he saw that the other camps were lost, with two </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">thousand spears and as many bowmen, but the Tyroshi sellsword who led his </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">freeriders struck his banners and went over to the foe.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Curse the man.” His uncle Kevan sounded more angry than surprised. “I </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">warned Jaime not to trust that one. A man who fights for coin is loyal only to his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="75" height="22" font="2">purse.” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin wove his fingers together under his chin. Only his eyes moved as </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">he listened. His bristling golden side-whiskers framed a face so still it might have </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">been a mask, but Tyrion could see tiny beads of sweat dappling his father’s shaven </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="57" height="22" font="2">head. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“How could it <i>happen</i>?” Ser Harys Swyft wailed again. “Ser Jaime taken, the </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="375" height="22" font="2">siege broken. . . this is a <i>catastrophe</i>!” </text>
</page>
<page number="612" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Addam Marbrand said, “I am sure we are all grateful to you for pointing </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="694" height="22" font="2">out the obvious, Ser Harys. The question is, what shall we do about it?” </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“What <i>can</i> we do? Jaime’s host is all slaughtered or taken or put to flight, and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the Starks and the Tullys sit squarely across our line of supply. We are cut off from </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the west! They can march on Casterly Rock if they so choose, and what’s to stop </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="549" height="22" font="2">them? My lords, we are beaten. We must sue for peace.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Peace?” Tyrion swirled his wine thoughtfully, took a deep draft, and hurled </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his empty cup to the floor, where it shattered into a thousand pieces. “There’s your </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">peace, Ser Harys. My sweet nephew broke it for good and all when he decided to </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">ornament the Red Keep with Lord Eddard’s head. You’ll have an easier time </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">drinking wine from that cup than you will convincing Robb Stark to make peace </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="457" height="22" font="2">now. He’s <i>winning</i> . . . or hadn’t you noticed?” </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Two battles do not make a war,” Ser Addam insisted. “We are far from lost. I </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="692" height="22" font="2">should welcome the chance to try my own steel against this Stark boy.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Perhaps they would consent to a truce, and allow us to trade our prisoners for </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="289" height="22" font="2">theirs,” offered Lord Lefford. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Unless they trade three-for-one, we still come out light on those scales,” </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Tyrion said acidly. “And what are we to offer for my brother? Lord Eddard’s rotting </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">head?” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“I had heard that Queen Cersei has the Hand’s daughters,” Lefford said </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="481" height="22" font="2">hopefully. “If we give the lad his sisters back. . .” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Addam snorted disdainfully. “He would have to be an utter ass to trade </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="355" height="22" font="2">Jaime Lannister’s life for two girls.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="702" height="22" font="2">“Then we must ransom Ser Jaime, whatever it costs,” Lord Lefford said. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion rolled his eyes. “If the Starks feel the need for gold, they can melt </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="219" height="22" font="2">down Jaime’s armor.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“if we ask for a truce, they  will think us weak,” Ser Addam  argued. “We </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">should march on them at once.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“Surely our friends at court could be prevailed upon to join us with fresh </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">troops,” said Ser Harys. “And someone might return to Casterly Rock to raise a new </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">host.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin Lannister rose to his feet. “<i>They have my son</i>,” he said once more, </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in a voice that cut through the babble like a sword through suet. “Leave me. All of </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="59" height="22" font="2">you.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ever the soul of obedience, Tyrion rose to depart with the rest, but his father </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">gave him a look. “Not you, Tyrion. Remain. And you as well, Kevan. The rest of </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="101" height="22" font="2">you, out.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Tyrion eased himself back onto the bench, startled into speechlessness. Ser </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Kevan crossed the room to the wine casks. “Uncle,” Tyrion called, “if you would be </text>

<page number="613" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="111" height="22" font="2">so kind—” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="581" height="22" font="2">“Here.” His father offered him his cup, the wine untouched. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="439" height="22" font="2">Now Tyrion truly <i>was</i> nonplussed. He drank. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin seated himself. “You have the right of it about Stark. Alive, we </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">might have used Lord Eddard to forge a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, a </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">peace that would have given us the time we need to deal with Robert’s brothers. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="628" height="22" font="2">Dead. . .” His hand curled into a fist. “Madness. Rank madness.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Joff’s only a boy,” Tyrion pointed out. “At his age, I committed a few follies </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">of my own.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">His father gave him a sharp look. “I suppose we ought to be grateful that he </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="290" height="22" font="2">has not yet married a whore.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Tyrion sipped at his wine, wondering how Lord Tywin would look if he flung </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">the cup in his face. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Our position is worse than you know,” his father went on. “It would seem we </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="179" height="22" font="2">have a new king.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan looked poleaxed. “A new—<i>who? </i>What have they done to Joffrey?” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="773" height="22" font="2">The faintest flicker of distaste played across Lord Tywin’s thin lips. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">“Nothing. . . yet. My grandson still sits the Iron Throne, but the eunuch has heard </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whispers from the south. Renly Baratheon wed Margaery Tyrell at Highgarden this </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fortnight past, and now he has claimed the crown. The bride’s father and brothers </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="475" height="22" font="2">have bent the knee and sworn him their swords.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Those are grave tidings.” When Ser Kevan frowned, the furrows in his brow </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="222" height="22" font="2">grew deep as canyons. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“My daughter commands us to ride for King’s Landing at once, to defend the </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Red Keep against King Renly and the Knight of Flowers.”  His mouth tightened. </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">“<i>Commands </i>us, mind you. In the name of the king and council.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“How is King Joffrey taking the news?” Tyrion asked with a certain black </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="121" height="22" font="2">amusement. </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Cersei has not seen fit to tell him yet,” Lord Tywin said. “She fears he might </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="415" height="22" font="2">insist on marching against Renly himself.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“With what army?” Tyrion asked. “You don’t plan to give him  <i>this</i>  one, I </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="74" height="22" font="2">hope?” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="538" height="22" font="2">“He talks of leading the City Watch,” Lord Tywin said. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“If he takes the Watch, he’ll leave the city undefended,” Ser Kevan said. “And </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="377" height="22" font="2">with Lord Stannis on Dragonstone. . .” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” Lord Tywin looked down at his son. “I had thought you were the one </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="623" height="22" font="2">made for motley, Tyrion, but it would appear that I was wrong.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Why, Father,” said Tyrion, “that almost sounds like praise.” He leaned </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">forward intently.  “What of Stannis? He’s the elder, not Renly. How does he feel </text>
</page>
<page number="614" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="267" height="22" font="2">about his brother’s claim?” </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His father frowned. “I have felt from the beginning that Stannis was a greater </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">danger than all the others combined. Yet he does nothing. Oh, Varys hears his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">whispers. Stannis is building ships, Stannis is hiring sellswords, Stannis is bringing </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a shadowbinder from Asshai. What does it mean? Is any of it true?” He gave an </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="416" height="22" font="2">irritated shrug. “Kevan, bring us the map.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan did as he was bid. Lord Tywin unrolled the leather, smoothing it </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">flat. “Jaime has left us in a bad way. Roose Bolton and the remnants of his host are </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">north of us. Our enemies hold the Twins and Moat Cailin. Robb Stark sits to the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">west, so we cannot retreat to Lannisport and the Rock unless we choose to give </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">battle. Jaime is taken, and his army for all purposes has ceased to exist. Thoros of </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Myr and Beric Dondarrion continue to plague our foraging parties. To our east we </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">have the Arryns, Stannis Baratheon sits on Dragonstone, and in the south </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="541" height="22" font="2">Highgarden and Storm’s End are calling their banners.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Tyrion smiled crookedly. “Take heart, Father. At least Rhaegar Targaryen is </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="110" height="22" font="2">still dead.” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I had hoped you might have more to offer us than japes, Tyrion,” Lord </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="216" height="22" font="2">Tywin Lannister said. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Ser Kevan frowned over the map, forehead creasing. “Robb Stark will have </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Edmure Tully and the lords of the Trident with him now. Their combined power </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">may exceed our own. And with Roose Bolton behind us. . . Tywin, if we remain </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="532" height="22" font="2">here, I fear we might be caught between three armies.” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I  have no intention of remaining here. We must finish our business with </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">young Lord Stark before Renly Baratheon can march from Highgarden. Bolton does </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">not concern me. He is a wary man, and we made him warier on the Green Fork. He </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">will be slow to give pursuit. So. . . on the morrow, we make for Harrenhal. Kevan, I </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">want Ser Addam’s outriders to screen our movements. Give him as many men as he </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="709" height="22" font="2">requires, and send them out in groups of four. I will have no vanishings.” </text>
<text top="832" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“As you say, my lord, but. . . why Harrenhal? That is a grim, unlucky place. </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="206" height="22" font="2">Some call it cursed.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Let them,” Lord Tywin said. “Unleash Ser Gregor and send him before us </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with his reavers. Send forth Vargo Hoat and his freeriders as well, and Ser Amory </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Lorch. Each is to have three hundred horse. Tell them I want to see the riverlands </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="411" height="22" font="2">afire from the Gods Eye to the Red Fork.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“They will burn, my lord,” Ser Kevan said, rising. “I shall give the </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="455" height="22" font="2">commands.” He bowed and made for the door. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">When they were alone, Lord Tywin glanced at Tyrion. “Your savages might </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">relish a bit of rapine. Tell them they may ride with Vargo Hoat and plunder as they </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="751" height="22" font="2">like—goods, stock, women, they may take what they want and burn the rest.” </text>

<text top="280" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He reached for his wine, and considered for a moment as he sipped. “And </text>

<text top="639" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">could see the anger in the gold of his eyes. “And dismissing Selmy, where was the </text>

<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“More than you know, Father,” Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">admit. Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">being sent to hold the left again. “Why me?” he asked, cocking his head to one side. </text>

<text top="115" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The shards of the broken cup crunched beneath his father’s heels as Lord </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Tywin crossed the room. “One last thing,” he said at the door. “You will not take </text>

<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion sat alone in the common room for a long while after his father was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">gone. Finally he climbed the steps to his cozy garret beneath the bell tower. The </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">ceiling was low, but that was scarcely a drawback for a dwarf. From the window, he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">could see the gibbet his father had erected in the yard. The innkeep’s body turned </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slowly on its rope whenever the night wind gusted. Her flesh had grown as thin and </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="262" height="22" font="2">ragged as Lannister hopes. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Shae murmured sleepily and rolled toward him when he sat on the edge of the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">featherbed. He slid his hand under the blanket and cupped a soft breast, and her </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="520" height="22" font="2">eyes opened. “M’lord,” she said with a drowsy smile. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">When he felt her nipple stiffen, Tyrion kissed her. “I have a mind to take you </text>

<text top="318" left="122" width="750" height="22" font="2">through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. </text>
<text top="345" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. “Ghost,” he </text>
<text top="373" left="54" width="625" height="22" font="2">called softly, “to me.” And the wolf was there, eyes like embers. </text>
<text top="400" left="108" width="352" height="22" font="2">“Jon, please. You must not do this.” </text>
<text top="428" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He  mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the </text>
<text top="456" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his </text>
<text top="483" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">shoulder. He threw a giant’s shadow, immense and black. “Get out of my way, </text>

<text top="538" left="108" width="444" height="22" font="2">“Jon, you <i>can’t</i>,” Sam said. “I won’t let you.” </text>
<text top="566" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I would sooner not hurt you,” Jon told him. “Move aside, Sam, or I’ll ride </text>

<text top="621" left="108" width="481" height="22" font="2">“You won’t. You have to listen to me. Please. . .” </text>
<text top="649" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant </text>
<text top="676" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his </text>
<text top="704" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on </text>
<text top="731" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell. The mare </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="327" height="22" font="2">leapt over him, out into the night. </text>
<text top="787" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon  raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn’t hurt himself, falling like that. He was so </text>
<text top="925" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">getting out of the way. “I warned him,” Jon said aloud. “It was nothing to do with </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">him, anyway.” He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the </text>

<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to </text>

<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">imagine him braving the guards in front of the King’s Tower to wake Mormont </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="114" height="22" font="2">from sleep. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear’s breakfast from the kitchen, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">they’d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">done that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son’s disgrace. That seemed a </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn’t be helped. No matter what he </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="494" height="22" font="2">did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods’ will </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="606" height="22" font="2">nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="224" height="22" font="2">were injured or blown. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he’d need to steal them. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him. Once Maester </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Aemon’s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven. Not even at </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind’s eye, as if he had left it only </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage’s </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="207" height="22" font="2">and Florian the Fool. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">father’s son, and Robb’s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="801" height="22" font="2">the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="810" height="22" font="2">and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life—</text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">man’s hand be raised against him. But it made no matter, so long as he lived long </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="703" height="22" font="2">enough to take his place by his brother’s side and help avenge his father. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">melting in his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">tried to imagine the look on Robb’s face when he revealed himself. His brother </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="596" height="22" font="2">would shake his head and smile, and he’d say. . . he’d say. . .  </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found </text>

<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">dragged the man to the stump. Bran’s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father’s face </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="574" height="22" font="2">Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">must, surely, <i>surely</i> . . . and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He <i>had</i> to, or </text>

<text top="998" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">It  did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">clutched the reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common </text>

<text top="142" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">mouth. Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="667" height="22" font="2">He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">road: Mole’s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule’s </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="205" height="22" font="2">slats, but only a few. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Mole’s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he’d heard men call the whores </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">“buried treasures.” He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="742" height="22" font="2">there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">and the mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">aching. A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">together, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt  was icy cold. He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too. <i>I am doing </i></text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="543" height="22" font="4"><i>the right thing</i>, he told himself, <i>so why do I feel so bad? </i></text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">tiny streams and littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">to die? </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">up. His mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hands around his mouth. “<i>Ghost!</i>” he shouted. “Ghost, to me.” The only answer was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="477" height="22" font="2">a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she was dry. Ghost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was concerned about his missing wolf. “<i>Ghost,</i>” he called again. “Where are you? </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">To me! <i>Ghost!</i>” Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">chance to catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">He’d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he’d filched from the kitchens, </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he’d need to hunt, </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="249" height="22" font="2">and that would slow him. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">along the kingsroad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. Could he outrun </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them? No, they were too close, they’d hear him for a certainty, and if they were </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="217" height="22" font="2">from Castle Black. . .  </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">“Quiet  now,” he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by. Likely as not, they were </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">only smallfolk from Mole’s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">what they were doing out in the middle of the night. . .  </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">briskly down the kingsroad. From the sound, there were five or six of them at the </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">least. Their voices drifted through the trees. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="311" height="22" font="2">“. . . certain he came this way?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="222" height="22" font="2">“We <i>can’t</i> be certain.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="2">the woods. That’s what I’d do.” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“In the dark? Stupid. If you didn’t fall off your horse and break your neck, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="661" height="22" font="2">you’d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.” </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I would not.” Grenn sounded peeved. “I’d just ride south, you can tell south </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="132" height="22" font="2">by the stars.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="410" height="22" font="2">“What if the sky was cloudy?” Pyp asked. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="219" height="22" font="2">“Then I wouldn’t go.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">Another voice broke in. “You know where I’d be if it was me? I’d be in </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Mole’s Town, digging for buried treasure.” Toad’s shrill laughter boomed through </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="286" height="22" font="2">the trees. Jon’s mare snorted. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="664" height="22" font="2">“Keep quiet, all of you,” Haider said. “I thought I heard something.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="520" height="22" font="2">“Where? I didn’t hear anything.” The horses stopped. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="296" height="22" font="2">“<i>You </i>can’t hear yourself fart.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="269" height="22" font="2">“I can too,” Grenn insisted. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="89" height="22" font="2">“<i>Quiet!</i>” </text>

<page number="622" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">They all fell silent, listening. Jon found himself holding his breath.  <i>Sam</i>,  he </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">thought. He hadn’t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn’t gone to bed either, he’d </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">woken the other boys. Damn them all. Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="669" height="22" font="2">they’d be named deserters too. What did they think they were doing? </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">could see the legs of their horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="216" height="22" font="2">“What did you hear?” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I don’t know,” Haider admitted. “A sound, I thought it might have been a </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="135" height="22" font="2">horse but. . .” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="233" height="22" font="2">“There’s nothing here.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">trees. Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="664" height="22" font="2">that Jon’s mare started and gave a whinny. “<i>There!</i>” Halder shouted. </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="159" height="22" font="2">“I heard it too!” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Traitor,” Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mare’s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="83" height="22" font="2">ten feet. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="293" height="22" font="2">“<i>Jon!</i>” Pyp shouted after him. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="473" height="22" font="2">“Pull up,” Grenn said. “You can’t outrun us all.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. “Get back. I don’t wish </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="339" height="22" font="2">to hurt you, but I will if I have to.” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“One against seven?” Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="49" height="22" font="2">him. </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="448" height="22" font="2">“What do you want with me?” Jon demanded. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="555" height="22" font="2">“We want to take you back where you belong,” Pyp said. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="273" height="22" font="2">“I belong with my brother.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="390" height="22" font="2">“<i>We’re </i>your brothers now,” Grenn said. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“They’ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,” Toad put in with a </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="746" height="22" font="2">nervous laugh. “This is so stupid, it’s like something the Aurochs would do.” </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I would not,” Grenn said. “I’m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="71" height="22" font="2">them.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“So did I,” Jon told them. “Don’t you understand? They murdered my <i>father</i>. </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">It’s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands—” </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="569" height="22" font="2">“We know,” said Pyp solemnly. “Sam told us everything.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“We’re sorry about your father,” Grenn said, “but it doesn’t matter. Once you </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="469" height="22" font="2">say the words, you can’t leave, no matter what.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="300" height="22" font="2">“I <i>have</i> to,” Jon said fervently. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You said the words,” Pyp reminded him. “<i>Now my watch begins</i>, you said it. </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="311" height="22" font="4"><i>It shall not end until my death</i>.” </text>

<page number="623" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="108" width="542" height="22" font="2">“<i>I shall live and die at my post</i>,” Grenn added, nodding. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You don’t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.” He was </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">angry now. Why couldn’t they let him go in peace? They were only making it </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="73" height="22" font="2">harder. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="483" height="22" font="2">“<i>I am the sword in the darkness</i>,” Halder intoned. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="395" height="22" font="2">“<i>The watcher on the walls</i>,” piped Toad. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">closer, reciting, “<i>I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the </i></text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="793" height="22" font="4"><i>dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men</i>.” </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Stay back,” Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. “I mean it, Pyp.” They </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="672" height="22" font="2">weren’t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to. </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Matthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. “<i>I pledge my life and </i></text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="4"><i>honor to the Night’s Watch</i>.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="291" height="22" font="2">now, closing from every side. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="486" height="22" font="2">“<i>For this night</i>. . .” Halder trotted in from the left. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“. . . <i>and all the nights to come</i>,” finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon’s </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="638" height="22" font="2">reins. “So here are your choices. Kill me, or come back with me.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon lifted his sword. . . and lowered it, helpless. “Damn you,” he said. “Damn </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="89" height="22" font="2">you all.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you’ll ride </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="298" height="22" font="2">back peaceful?” asked Halder. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I won’t run, if that’s what you mean.” Ghost moved out from under the trees </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and Jon glared at him. “Small help you were,” he said. The deep red eyes looked at </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="158" height="22" font="2">him knowingly. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“We had best hurry,” Pyp said. “If we’re not back before first light, the Old </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="293" height="22" font="2">Bear will have <i>all</i> our heads.” </text>

<text top="832" left="54" width="826" height="22" font="2">journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop. Mole’s Town </text>

<text top="942" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall. It did not seem like </text>

<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">at least no one would  follow him. He wouldn’t stray within a hundred leagues of </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. “I. . . I’m glad </text>

<text top="253" left="108" width="327" height="22" font="2">“I’m not,” Jon said, dismounting. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. “Give </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam,” the small boy said. “We have a long day </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="576" height="22" font="2">before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-</text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear’s breakfast. Today it was </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wrinkled plums. Jon carried the food back to the King’s Tower. He found Mormont </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">at the window seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shoulders, muttering, “<i>Corn, corn, corn</i>.” The bird shrieked when Jon entered. “Put </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="742" height="22" font="2">the food on the table,” the Old Bear said, glancing up. “I’ll have some beer.” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">and filled a horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Doubtless you loved your father,” Mormont said when Jon brought him his </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">horn. “The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">that?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“I remember,” Jon said sullenly. He did not care to talk of his father’s death, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="215" height="22" font="2">not even to Mormont. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="345" height="22" font="2">Jon’s throat was dry. “You know?” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="609" height="22" font="2">“<i>Know</i>,” the raven echoed from Mormont’s shoulder. “<i>Know</i>.” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear snorted. “Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Night’s Watch because I’m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you’d go. I </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="396" height="22" font="2">“My friends brought me back,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="587" height="22" font="2">“Did I say it was <i>your</i> honor?” Mormont inspected his plate. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="574" height="22" font="2">“They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?” </text>

<text top="59" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.” Mormont tried a </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">plum, spit out the pit. “I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="760" height="22" font="2">and not by friends. Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven. Do you?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="249" height="22" font="2">“No.” Jon felt like a fool. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="368" height="22" font="2">“Pity, we could use a horse like that.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="748" height="22" font="2">at the least. “I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I’m not afraid to die.” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="224" height="22" font="2">“<i>Die!</i>” the raven cried. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Nor live, I hope,” Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bite to the bird. “You have not deserted—yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">boy who rode to Mole’s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="214" height="22" font="2">that your hope, boy?” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="151" height="22" font="2">Jon kept silent. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“I thought so.” Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. “Your father is </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="485" height="22" font="2">dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="263" height="22" font="2">“No,” he answered, sullen. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Good,” Mormont said. “We’ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it’s not something I care to see again.” He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">of shell out from between his teeth. “Your brother is in the field with all the power </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">of the north behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">than you’ll find in all the Night’s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="230" height="22" font="2">magic up your sword?” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="792" height="22" font="2">shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke. </text>
<text top="804" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">The Old Bear sighed. “You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">not, my sister is marching in your brother’s host, her and those daughters of hers, </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">dressed in men’s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.” </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">crunched. “Or perhaps it does. Be that as it may, I’d still grieve if she were slain, </text>

<text top="1053" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="4"><i>I have no place</i>, Jon wanted to say, <i>I’m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, </i></text>

<text top="731" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">came into view, and she heard the creak of heavy chains as the great iron portcullis </text>
<text top="759" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was winched upward. It rose slowly as they approached, and Catelyn saw that the </text>
<text top="787" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">lower half of it was red with rust. The bottom foot dripped brown mud on them as </text>
<text top="814" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">they passed underneath, the barbed spikes mere inches above their heads. Catelyn </text>
<text top="842" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">gazed up at the bars and wondered how deep the rust went and how well the </text>
<text top="869" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">portcullis would stand up to a ram and whether it ought to be replaced. Thoughts </text>
<text top="897" left="54" width="501" height="22" font="2">like that were seldom far from her mind these days. </text>
<text top="925" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">They passed beneath the arch and under the walls, moving from sunlight to </text>
<text top="952" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">shadow and back into sunlight. Boats large and small were tied up all around them, </text>
<text top="980" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">secured to iron rings set in the stone. Her father’s guards waited on the water stair </text>
<text top="1007" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with her brother. Ser Edmure Tully was a stocky young man with a shaggy head of </text>
<text top="1035" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">auburn hair and a fiery beard. His breastplate was scratched and dented from battle, </text>
<text top="1063" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">his blue-and-red cloak stained by blood and smoke. At his side stood the Lord Tytos </text>
<text top="1090" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Blackwood, a hard pike of a man with close-cropped salt-and-pepper whiskers and </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">a hook nose. His bright yellow armor was inlaid with jet in elaborate vine-and-leaf </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">patterns, and a cloak sewn from raven feathers draped his thin shoulders. It had </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">been Lord Tytos who led the sortie that plucked her brother from the Lannister </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="64" height="22" font="2">camp. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Bring them in,” Ser Edmure commanded. Three men scrambled down the </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">stairs knee-deep in the water and pulled the boat close with long hooks. When Grey </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Wind bounded out, one of them dropped his pole and lurched back, stumbling and </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">sitting down abruptly in the river. The others laughed, and the man got a sheepish </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">look on his face. Theon Greyjoy vaulted over the side of the boat and lifted Catelyn </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="797" height="22" font="2">by the waist, setting her on a dry step above him as water lapped around his boots. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Edmure came down the steps to embrace her. “Sweet sister,” he murmured </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">hoarsely. He had deep blue eyes and a mouth made for smiles, but he was not </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">smiling now. He looked worn and tired, battered by battle and haggard from strain. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="804" height="22" font="2">His neck was bandaged where he had taken a wound. Catelyn hugged him fiercely. </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Your grief is mine, Cat,” he said when they broke apart. “When we heard </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">about Lord Eddard. . . the Lannisters will pay, I swear it, you will have your </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="124" height="22" font="2">vengeance.” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Will that bring Ned back to me?” she said sharply. The wound was still too </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fresh for softer words. She could not think about Ned now. She would not. It would </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="658" height="22" font="2">not do. She had to be strong. “All that will keep. I must see Father.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="414" height="22" font="2">“He awaits you in his solar,” Edmure said. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Lord Hoster is bedridden, my lady,” her father’s steward explained. When </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had that good man grown so old and grey? “He instructed me to bring you to him at </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="68" height="22" font="2">once.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“I’ll take her.” Edmure escorted her up the water stair and across the lower </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">bailey, where Petyr Baelish and Brandon Stark had once crossed swords for her </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">favor. The massive sandstone walls of the keep loomed above them. As they pushed </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">through a door between two guardsmen in fish-crest helms, she asked, “How bad is </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="515" height="22" font="2">he?” dreading the answer even as she said the words. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Edmure’s look was somber. “He will not be with us long, the maesters say. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="381" height="22" font="2">The pain is. . . constant, and grievous.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">A blind rage filled her, a rage at all the world; at her brother Edmure and her </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">sister Lysa, at the Lannisters, at the maesters, at Ned and her father and the </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">monstrous gods who would take them both away from her. “You should have told </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="640" height="22" font="2">me,” she said. “You should have sent word as soon as you knew.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“He forbade it. He did not want his enemies to know that he was dying. With </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">the realm so troubled, he feared that if the Lannisters suspected how frail he </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">was. . .” </text>

<text top="170" left="108" width="384" height="22" font="2">They climbed the spiral stair in silence. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">The keep was three-sided, like Riverrun itself, and Lord Hoster’s solar was </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">triangular as well, with a stone balcony that jutted out to the east like the prow of </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">some great sandstone ship. From there the lord of the castle could look down on his </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">walls and battlements, and beyond, to where the waters met. They had moved her </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">father’s bed out onto the balcony. “He likes to sit in the sun and watch the rivers,” </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="766" height="22" font="2">Edmure explained. “Father, see who I’ve brought. Cat has come to see you. . .” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Hoster Tully had always been a big man; tall and broad in his youth, portly as </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">he grew older. Now he seemed shrunken, the muscle and meat melted off his bones. </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Even his face sagged. The last time Catelyn had seen him, his hair and beard had </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="702" height="22" font="2">been brown, well streaked with grey. Now they had gone white as snow. </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">His eyes opened to the sound of Edmure’s voice. “Little cat,” he murmured in </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">a voice thin and wispy and wracked by pain. “My little cat.” A tremulous smile </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="660" height="22" font="2">touched his face as his hand groped for hers. “I watched for you. . .” </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I shall leave you to talk,” her brother said, kissing their lord father gently on </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="289" height="22" font="2">the brow before he withdrew. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">Catelyn knelt and took her father’s hand  in hers. It was a big hand, but </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the strength gone from </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="597" height="22" font="2">it. “You should have told me,” she said. “A rider, a raven. . .” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Riders are taken, questioned,” he answered. “Ravens are brought down. . .” </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">A spasm of pain took him, and his fingers clutched hers hard. “The crabs are in my </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">belly. . . pinching, always pinching. Day and night. They have fierce claws, the </text>

<text top="887" left="108" width="752" height="22" font="2">“I’m here, Father,” she said. “With Robb, my son. He’ll want to see you too.” </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="599" height="22" font="2">“Your boy,” he whispered. “He had my eyes, I remember. . .” </text>
<text top="942" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“He did, and does. And we’ve brought you Jaime Lannister, in irons. Riverrun </text>

<text top="998" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Lord Hoster smiled. “I saw. Last night, when it began, I told them. . . had to </text>

<text top="87" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Yes,” Catelyn said, fiercely proud. “It was Robb. . . and Brynden. Your </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="322" height="22" font="2">brother is here as well, my lord.” </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Him.” Her father’s voice was a faint whisper. “The Blackfish. . . came back? </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="166" height="22" font="2">From the Vale?” </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="71" height="22" font="2">“Yes.” </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“And Lysa?” A cool wind moved through his thin white hair. “Gods be good, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="364" height="22" font="2">your sister. . . did she come as well?” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">He sounded so full of hope and yearning that it was hard to tell the truth. “No. </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="137" height="22" font="2">I’m sorry. . .” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Oh.” His face fell, and some light went out of his eyes. “I’d hoped I would </text>

<text top="391" left="108" width="335" height="22" font="2">“She’s with her son, in the Eyrie.” </text>
<text top="418" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Lord Hoster gave a weary nod. “Lord Robert now, poor Arryn’s gone. . . I </text>

<text top="473" left="108" width="768" height="22" font="2">“She  is frightened, my lord. In the Eyrie she feels safe.” She kissed his </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="716" height="22" font="2">wrinkled brow. “Robb will be waiting. Will you see him? And Brynden?” </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Your son,” he whispered. “Yes. Cat’s child. . . he had my eyes, I remember. </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Her father glanced out over the rivers. “Blackfish,” he said. “Has he wed yet? </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="287" height="22" font="2">Taken some. . . girl to wife?” </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="4"><i>Even on his deathbed</i>, Catelyn thought sadly. “He has not wed. You know </text>

<text top="722" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I told him. . . <i>commanded </i>him. Marry! I was his lord. He knows. My right, to </text>

<text top="777" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">redwoods and great old elms, kneeling before the heart tree, a slender weirwood </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">with a face more sad than fierce. His longsword was before him, the point thrust in </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">the earth, his gloved hands clasped around the hilt. Around him others knelt: </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">Greatjon Umber, Rickard Karstark, Maege Mormont, Galbart Glover, and more. </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Even Tytos Blackwood was among them, the great raven cloak fanned out behind </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">him. <i>These are the ones who keep the old gods</i>, she realized. She asked herself what </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="538" height="22" font="2">gods she kept these days, and could not find an answer. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">It would not do to disturb them at their prayers. The gods must have their </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">due. . . even cruel gods who would take Ned from her, and her lord father as well. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">So Catelyn waited. The river wind moved through the high branches, and she could </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">see the Wheel Tower to her right, ivy crawling up its side. As she stood there, all </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the memories came flooding back to her. Her father had taught her to ride amongst </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">these trees, and that was the elm that Edmure had fallen from when he broke his </text>

<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">arm, and over there, beneath that bower, she and Lysa had played at kissing with </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="63" height="22" font="2">Petyr. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She had not thought of that in years. How young they all had been—she no </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">older than Sansa, Lysa younger than Arya, and Petyr younger still, yet eager. The </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">girls had traded him between them, serious and giggling by turns. It came back to </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her so vividly she could almost feel his sweaty fingers on her shoulders and taste </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the mint on his breath. There was always mint growing in the godswood, and Petyr </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had liked to chew it. He had been such a bold little boy, always in trouble. “He tried </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">to put his tongue in my mouth,” Catelyn had confessed to her sister afterward, when </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">they were alone. “He did with me too,” Lysa had whispered, shy and breathless. “I </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="90" height="22" font="2">liked it.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and Catelyn found herself </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the godswood. Surely he must </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">have. She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him moist-eyed glances, and some of the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">serving girls, even ones as old as eighteen. . . he had ridden in battle and killed men </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">with a sword, surely he had been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She wiped </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="190" height="22" font="2">them away angrily. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“Mother,” Robb said when he saw her standing there. “We must call a </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="395" height="22" font="2">council. There are things to be decided.” </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="730" height="22" font="2">“Your grandfather would like to see you,” she said. “Robb, he’s very sick.” </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Ser Edmure told me. I am sorry, Mother. . . for Lord Hoster and for you. Yet </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">first we must meet. We’ve had word from the south. Renly Baratheon has claimed </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="209" height="22" font="2">his brother’s crown.” </text>
<text top="694" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“Renly?” she said, shocked. “I had thought, surely it would be Lord </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">Stannis. . .” </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="451" height="22" font="2">“So did we all, my lady,” Galbart Glover said. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">The war council convened in the Great Hall, at four long trestle tables </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">arranged in a broken square. Lord Hoster was too weak to attend, asleep on his </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">balcony, dreaming of the sun on the rivers of his youth. Edmure sat in the high seat </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">of the Tullys, with Brynden Blackfish at his side, and his father’s bannermen </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">arrayed to right and left and along the side tables. Word of the victory at Riverrun </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">had spread to the fugitive lords of the Trident, drawing them back. Karyl Vance </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">came in, a lord now, his father dead beneath the Golden Tooth. Ser Marq Piper was </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">with him, and they brought a Darry, Ser Raymun’s son, a lad no older than Bran. </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">Lord Jonos Bracken arrived from the ruins of Stone Hedge, glowering and </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="808" height="22" font="2">blustering, and took a seat as far from Tytos Blackwood as the tables would permit. </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The northern lords sat opposite, with Catelyn and Robb facing her brother </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">across the tables. They were fewer. The Greatjon sat at Robb’s left hand, and then </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Theon Greyjoy; Galbart Glover and Lady Mormont were to the right of Catelyn. </text>
</page>
<page number="634" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Lord Rickard Karstark, gaunt and hollow-eyed in his grief, took his seat like a man </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in a nightmare, his long beard uncombed and unwashed. He had left two sons dead </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">in the Whispering Wood, and there was no word of the third, his eldest, who had led </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="616" height="22" font="2">the Karstark spears against Tywin Lannister on the Green Fork. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The arguing raged on late into the night. Each lord had a right to speak, and </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">speak they did. . . and shout, and curse, and reason, and cajole, and jest, and </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">bargain, and slam tankards on the table, and threaten, and walk out, and return </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="488" height="22" font="2">sullen or smiling. Catelyn sat and listened to it all. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">Roose Bolton had  re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">mouth of the causeway. Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin’s army had crossed the Trident, and was making for Harrenhal. And </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="630" height="22" font="2">there were two kings in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Many of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops. Lord Blackwood would </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton’s army down as well. What Blackwood </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="731" height="22" font="2">pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Renly is not the king,” Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="374" height="22" font="2">Like his father, he knew how to listen. </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord,” Galbart Glover said. “He put </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="211" height="22" font="2">your father to death.” </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“That makes him evil,” Robb replied. “I do not know that it makes Renly </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">king. Joffrey is still Robert’s eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="535" height="22" font="2">younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="570" height="22" font="2">“Tommen is no less a Lannister,” Ser Marq Piper snapped. </text>
<text top="915" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“As you say,” said Robb, troubled. “Yet if neither one is king, still, how could </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">it be Lord Renly? He’s Robert’s <i>younger</i> brother. Bran can’t be Lord of Winterfell </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="557" height="22" font="2">before me, and Renly can’t be king before Lord Stannis.” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="578" height="22" font="2">Lady Mormont agreed. “Lord Stannis has the better claim.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Renly is <i>crowned</i>,” said Marq Piper. “Highgarden and Storm’s End support </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. <i>Six</i>, if </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we </text>

<page number="635" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, <i>all</i> of them! That is what we shall win if we join with </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="77" height="22" font="2">aside?” </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“The right,” said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="187" height="22" font="2">father as he said it. </text>
<text top="225" left="108" width="550" height="22" font="2">“So you mean us to declare for Stannis?” asked Edmure. </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“I don’t know,” said Robb. “I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="749" height="22" font="2">but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we <i>will</i> be traitors.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“My lord father would urge caution,” aged Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smile of a Frey. “Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones. When they </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppose him, as we </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">choose. With Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce . . . and the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">safe return of his son. Noble lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhal and arrange </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="281" height="22" font="2">good terms and ransoms. . .” </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">A roar of outrage drowned out his voice. “<i>Craven!</i>” the Greatjon thundered. </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">“Begging for a truce will make us seem weak,” declared Lady Mormont. “Ransoms </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="738" height="22" font="2">be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer,” shouted Rickard Karstark. </text>
<text top="584" left="108" width="346" height="22" font="2">“Why not a peace?” Catelyn asked. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">The lords looked at her, but it was Robb’s eyes she felt, his and his alone. </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">“My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband,” he said grimly. He </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him, the bright steel on the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="575" height="22" font="2">rough wood. “This is the only peace I have for Lannisters.” </text>
<text top="722" left="108" width="770" height="22" font="2">The Greatjon bellowed his approval, and other men added their voices, </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">shouting and drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table. Catelyn waited </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">until they had quieted. “My lords,” she said then, “Lord Eddard was your liege, but </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">I shared his bed and bore his children. Do you think I love him any less than you?” </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Her voice almost broke with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">herself. “Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">until Ned stood at my side once more. . . but he is gone, and hundred Whispering </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="824" height="22" font="2">Woods will not change that. Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Karstark’s valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of them will </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="448" height="22" font="2">return to us. Must we have more deaths still?” </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">“You are a woman, my lady,” the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice. </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="407" height="22" font="2">“Women do not understand these things.” </text>
<text top="1053" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You are the gentle sex,” said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="431" height="22" font="2">his face. “A man has a need for vengeance.” </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how  <i>gentle</i>  a </text>

<page number="636" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="825" height="22" font="2">woman can be,” Catelyn replied. “Perhaps I do not understand tactics and </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">strategy. . . but I understand futility. We went to war when Lannister armies were </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">ravaging  the riverlands, and Ned was a prisoner, falsely accused of treason. We </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="565" height="22" font="2">fought to defend ourselves, and to win my lord’s freedom. </text>
<text top="170" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach. I will mourn </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">for Ned until the end of my days, but I must think of the living. I want my daughters </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">back, and the queen holds them still. If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">Winterfell from your father’s seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="331" height="22" font="2">lords, and weep for my husband.” </text>
<text top="363" left="108" width="550" height="22" font="2">The hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking. </text>
<text top="391" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">“Peace,” said her uncle Brynden. “Peace is  sweet, my lady. . . but on what </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">terms? It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="222" height="22" font="2">again on the morrow.” </text>
<text top="473" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="487" height="22" font="2">nothing but their bones?” asked Rickard Karstark. </text>
<text top="528" left="108" width="772" height="22" font="2">“Aye,” said Lord Bracken. “Gregor Clegane laid waste to my fields, </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">slaughtered my smallfolk, and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin. Am I now to bend </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">the knee to the ones who sent him? What have we fought for, if we are to put all </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="229" height="22" font="2">back as it was before?” </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">Lord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn’s surprise and dismay. “And if we do </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly? What if the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="624" height="22" font="2">stag should prevail against the lion, where would that leave us?” </text>

<text top="611" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“I swear it,” she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by </text>

<text top="666" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">The third level of the platform was woven of branches no thicker than a </text>

<text top="694" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“You have it, my queen,” Ser Jorah said, kneeling to lay his sword at her feet. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="580" height="22" font="2">“I vow to serve you, to obey you, to die for you if need be.” </text>

<text top="860" left="54" width="543" height="22" font="2">gently and said, “You are the first of my Queensguard.” </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">She could feel the eyes of the  <i>khalasar</i>  on her as she entered her tent. The </text>

<text top="225" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her milk-heavy breasts. The last dab was for </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">her sex. Irri’s finger felt as light and cool as a lover’s kiss as it slid softly up </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="169" height="22" font="2">between her lips. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Afterward, Dany sent them all away, so she might prepare Khal Drogo for his </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">final ride into the night lands. She washed his body clean and brushed and oiled his </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="822" height="22" font="2">hair, running her fingers through it for the last time, feeling the weight of it, </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">remembering the first time she had touched it, the night of their wedding ride. His </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">hair had never been cut. How many men could die with their hair uncut? She buried </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils. He smelled like grass and </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">warm earth, like smoke and semen and horses. He smelled like Drogo. <i>Forgive me, </i></text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>sun of my life</i>, she thought. <i>Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do. I paid </i></text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="498" height="22" font="4"><i>the price, my star, but it was too high, too high</i> . . .  </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Dany braided his hair and slid the silver rings onto his mustache and hung his </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">bells one by one. So many bells, gold and silver and bronze. Bells so his enemies </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">would hear him coming and  grow weak with fear. She dressed him in horsehair </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">leggings and high boots, buckling a belt heavy with gold and silver medallions </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">about his waist. Over his scarred chest she slipped a painted vest, old and faded, the </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">one Drogo had loved best. For herself she chose loose sandsilk trousers, sandals that </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="492" height="22" font="2">laced halfway up her legs, and a vest like Drogo’s. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">pyre. The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent. </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">Dany walked behind them. They laid him down on his cushions and silks, his head </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="512" height="22" font="2">toward the Mother of Mountains far to the northeast. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">“Oil,” she commanded, and they brought forth the jars and poured them over </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the pyre, soaking the silks and the brush and the bundles of dry grass, until the oil </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">trickled from beneath the logs and the air was rich with fragrance. “Bring my eggs,” </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="719" height="22" font="2">Dany commanded her handmaids. Something in her voice made them run. </text>
<text top="970" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah took her arm. “My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon’s eggs </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">in the night lands. Better to sell them in Asshai. Sell one and we can buy a ship to </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">take us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three and you will be a wealthy woman all </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="117" height="22" font="2">your days.” </text>
<text top="1080" left="108" width="506" height="22" font="2">“They were not given to me to sell,” Dany told him. </text>
<text top="1108" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She climbed the pyre herself to place the eggs around her sun-and-stars. The </text>

<page number="642" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">black beside his heart, under his arm. The green beside his head, his braid coiled </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">around it. The cream-and-gold down between his legs. When she kissed him for the </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="602" height="22" font="2">last time, Dany could taste the sweetness of the oil on his lips. </text>
<text top="142" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">As she climbed down off the pyre, she noticed Mirri Maz Duur watching her. </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="424" height="22" font="2">“You are mad,” the godswife said hoarsely. </text>
<text top="197" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">“Is it so far from madness to wisdom?” Dany asked. “Ser Jorah, take this </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="316" height="22" font="4"><i>maegi</i> and bind her to the pyre.” </text>
<text top="253" left="108" width="374" height="22" font="2">“To the. . . my queen, no, hear me. . .” </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">“Do as I say.” Still he hesitated, until her anger flared. “You swore to obey </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="462" height="22" font="2">me, whatever might come. Rakharo, help him.” </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo’s pyre and </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">staked her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil over the woman’s head </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">herself. “I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,” she said, “for the lessons you have taught </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="52" height="22" font="2">me.” </text>
<text top="446" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">“You will not hear me scream,” Mirri responded as the oil dripped from her </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="284" height="22" font="2">hair and soaked her clothing. </text>
<text top="501" left="108" width="767" height="22" font="2">“I will,” Dany said, “but it is not your screams I want, only your life. I </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.” Mirri Maz Duur opened </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away, Dany saw that the contempt </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">was gone from the  <i>maegi</i>’s  flat black eyes; in its place was something that might </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">have been fear. Then there was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="127" height="22" font="2">the first star. </text>
<text top="666" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">When a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride proud into </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the <i>khal</i> rises on </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">his fiery steed to take his place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="517" height="22" font="2">in life, the brighter his star will shine in the darkness. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">Jhogo spied it first. “<i>There</i>,” he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked and saw </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red. Bloodred; fire red; the </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="570" height="22" font="2">dragon’s tail. She could not have asked for a stronger sign. </text>
<text top="860" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Dany took the torch from Aggo’s hand and thrust it between the logs. The oil </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">took the fire at once, the brush and dried grass a heartbeat later. Tiny flames went </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">darting up the wood like swift red mice, skating over the oil and leaping from bark </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">to branch to leaf. A rising heat puffed at her face, soft and sudden as a lover’s </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">breath, but in seconds it had grown too hot to bear. Dany stepped backward. The </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">wood crackled, louder and louder. Mirri Maz Duur began to sing in a shrill, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">ululating voice. The flames whirled and writhed, racing each other up the platform. </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">The dusk shimmered as the air itself seemed to liquefy from the heat. Dany heard </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">logs spit and crack. The fires swept over Mirri Maz Duur. Her song grew louder, </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">shriller. . . then she gasped, again and again, and her song became a shuddering </text>
</page>
<page number="643" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="363" height="22" font="2">wail, thin and high and full of agony. </text>
<text top="87" left="108" width="765" height="22" font="2">And now the flames reached her Drogo, and now they were all around him. </text>
<text top="115" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">His clothing took fire, and for an instant the  <i>khal</i>  was clad in wisps of floating </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">orange silk and tendrils of curling smoke, grey and greasy. Dany’s lips parted and </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">she found herself holding her breath. Part of her wanted to go to him as Ser Jorah </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">had feared, to rush into the flames to beg for his forgiveness and take him inside her </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">one last time, the fire melting the flesh from their bones until they were as one, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="81" height="22" font="2">forever. </text>
<text top="280" left="108" width="769" height="22" font="2">She could smell the odor of burning flesh, no different than horseflesh </text>
<text top="308" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">roasting in a firepit. The pyre roared in the deepening dusk like some great beast, </text>
<text top="335" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">drowning out the fainter sound of Mirri Maz Duur’s screaming and sending up long </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">tongues of flame to lick at the belly of the night. As the smoke grew thicker, the </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Dothraki backed away, coughing. Huge orange gouts of fire unfurled their banners </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">in that hellish wind, the logs hissing and cracking, glowing cinders rising on the </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">smoke to float away into the dark like so many newborn fireflies. The heat beat at </text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">the air with great red wings, driving the Dothraki back, driving off even Mormont, </text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">but Dany stood her ground. She was the blood of the dragon, and the fire was in </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="43" height="22" font="2">her. </text>
<text top="556" left="108" width="763" height="22" font="2">She had sensed the truth of it long ago, Dany thought as she took a step closer </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">to the conflagration, but the brazier had not been hot enough. The flames writhed </text>
<text top="611" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">before her like the women who had danced at her wedding, whirling and singing </text>
<text top="639" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">and spinning their yellow and orange and crimson veils, fearsome to behold, yet </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">lovely, so lovely, alive with heat. Dany opened her arms to them, her skin flushed </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and glowing. <i>This is a wedding, too</i>, she thought. Mirri Maz Duur had fallen silent. </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="698" height="22" font="2">The godswife thought her a child, but children grow, and children learn. </text>
<text top="749" left="108" width="762" height="22" font="2">Another step, and Dany could feel the heat of the sand on the soles of her feet, </text>
<text top="777" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">even through her sandals. Sweat ran down her thighs and between her breasts and in </text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">rivulets over her cheeks, where tears had once run. Ser Jorah was shouting behind </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">her, but he did not matter anymore, only the fire mattered. The flames were so </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">beautiful, the loveliest things she had ever seen, each one a sorcerer robed in yellow </text>
<text top="887" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">and orange and scarlet, swirling long smoky cloaks. She saw crimson firelions and </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">great yellow serpents and unicorns made of pale blue flame; she saw fish and foxes </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">and monsters, wolves and bright birds and flowering trees, each more beautiful than </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">the last. She saw a horse, a great grey stallion limned in smoke, its flowing mane a </text>
<text top="998" left="54" width="783" height="22" font="2">nimbus of blue flame. <i>Yes, my love, my sun-and-stars, yes, mount now, ride now</i>. </text>
<text top="1025" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Her vest had begun to smolder, so Dany shrugged it off and let it fall to the </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">ground. The painted leather burst into sudden flame as she skipped closer to the </text>
<text top="1080" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">fire, her breasts bare to the blaze, streams of milk flowing from her red and swollen </text>
<text top="1108" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">nipples. <i>Now</i>, she thought, <i>now</i>, and for an instant she glimpsed Khal Drogo before </text>
</page>
<page number="644" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="59" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">her, mounted on his smoky stallion, a flaming lash in his hand. He smiled, and the </text>
<text top="87" left="54" width="379" height="22" font="2">whip snaked down at the pyre, hissing. </text>
<text top="115" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">She heard a  <i>crack</i>,  the sound of shattering stone. The platform of wood and </text>
<text top="142" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">brush and grass began to shift and collapse in upon itself. Bits of burning wood slid </text>
<text top="170" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">down at her, and Dany was showered with ash and cinders. And something else </text>
<text top="197" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">came crashing down, bouncing and rolling, to land at her feet; a chunk of curved </text>
<text top="225" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">rock, pale and veined with gold, broken and smoking. The roaring filled the world, </text>
<text top="253" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">yet dimly through the firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in </text>
<text top="280" left="54" width="84" height="22" font="2">wonder. </text>
<text top="308" left="108" width="270" height="22" font="4"><i>Only death can pay for life</i>. </text>
<text top="335" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">And there came a second  <i>crack</i>,  loud and sharp as thunder, and the smoke </text>
<text top="363" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs exploding as the fire </text>
<text top="391" left="54" width="821" height="22" font="2">touched their secret hearts. She heard the screams of frightened horses, and the </text>
<text top="418" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">voices of the Dothraki raised in shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her </text>
<text top="446" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">name and cursing. <i>No</i>, she wanted to shout to him, <i>no, my good knight, do not fear </i></text>
<text top="473" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="4"><i>for me. The fire is mine. I am Daenerys Stormborn, daughter of dragons, bride of </i></text>
<text top="501" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="4"><i>dragons, mother of dragons, don’t you see? Don’t you SEE?</i> With a belch of flame </text>
<text top="528" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">and smoke that reached thirty feet into the sky, the pyre collapsed and came down </text>
<text top="556" left="54" width="823" height="22" font="2">around her. Unafraid, Dany stepped forward into the firestorm, calling to her </text>
<text top="584" left="54" width="91" height="22" font="2">children. </text>
<text top="611" left="108" width="651" height="22" font="2">The third <i>crack</i> was as loud and sharp as the breaking of the world. </text>
<text top="639" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">When the fire died at last and the ground became cool enough to walk upon, </text>
<text top="666" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">Ser Jorah Mormont found her amidst the ashes, surrounded by blackened logs and </text>
<text top="694" left="54" width="816" height="22" font="2">bits of glowing ember and the burnt bones of man and woman and stallion. She was </text>
<text top="722" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">naked, covered with soot, her clothes turned to ash, her beautiful hair all crisped </text>
<text top="749" left="54" width="278" height="22" font="2">away. . . yet she was unhurt. </text>
<text top="777" left="108" width="756" height="22" font="2">The cream-and-gold dragon was suckling at her left breast, the green-and-</text>
<text top="804" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">bronze at the right. Her arms cradled them close. The black-and-scarlet beast was </text>
<text top="832" left="54" width="819" height="22" font="2">draped across her shoulders, its long sinuous neck coiled under her chin. When it </text>
<text top="860" left="54" width="696" height="22" font="2">saw Jorah, it raised its head and looked at him with eyes as red as coals. </text>
<text top="887" left="108" width="764" height="22" font="2">Wordless, the knight fell to his knees. The men of her  <i>khas</i>  came  up behind </text>
<text top="915" left="54" width="820" height="22" font="2">him. Jhogo was the first to lay his  <i>arakh</i>  at her feet. “Blood of my blood,” he </text>
<text top="942" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">murmured, pushing his face to the smoking earth. “Blood of my blood,” she heard </text>
<text top="970" left="54" width="506" height="22" font="2">Aggo echo. “Blood of my blood,” Rakharo shouted. </text>
<text top="998" left="108" width="766" height="22" font="2">And after them came her handmaids, and  then the others, all the Dothraki, </text>
<text top="1025" left="54" width="817" height="22" font="2">men and women and children, and Dany had only to look at their eyes to know that </text>
<text top="1053" left="54" width="818" height="22" font="2">they were hers now, today and tomorrow and forever, hers as they had never been </text>
