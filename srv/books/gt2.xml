<text top="637" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The comet’s tail spread across the dawn, a red slash that bled above the crags of </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">Dragonstone like a wound in the pink and purple sky. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The maester stood on the windswept balcony outside his chambers. It was here the ravens </text>
<text top="701" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">came, after long flight. Their droppings speckled the gargoyles that rose twelve feet tall on </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">either side of him, a hellhound and a wyvern, two of the thousand that brooded over the walls </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the ancient fortress. When first he came to Dragonstone, the army of stone grotesques had </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">made him uneasy, but as the years passed he had grown used to them. Now he thought of </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">them as old friends. The three of them watched the sky together with foreboding. </text>
<text top="804" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The maester did not believe in omens. And yet . . . old as he was, Cressen had never seen </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a comet half so bright, nor yet that color, that terrible color, the color of blood and flame and </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sunsets. He wondered if his gargoyles had ever seen its like. They had been here so much </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">longer than he had, and would still be here long after he was gone. If stone tongues could </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">speak . . . </text>
<text top="907" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Such folly.</i> He leaned against the battlement, the sea crashing beneath him, the black </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stone rough beneath his fingers. <i>Talking gargoyles and prophecies in the sky. I am an old </i></text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>done man, grown giddy as a child again</i>. Had a lifetime’s hard-won wisdom fled him along </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with his health and strength? He was a maester, trained and chained in the great Citadel of </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Oldtown. What had he come to, when superstition filled his head as if he were an ignorant </text>

<text top="1029" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And yet . . . and yet . . . the comet burned even by day now, while pale grey steam rose </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brought word from the Citadel itself, word long-expected but no less fearful for all that, word </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">of summer’s end. Omens, all. Too many to deny. <i>What does it all mean?</i> he wanted to cry. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Maester Cressen, we have visitors.” Pylos spoke softly, as if loath to disturb Cressen’s </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">solemn meditations. Had he known what drivel filled his head, he would have shouted. “The </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">princess would see the white raven.” Ever correct, Pylos called her <i>princess</i> now, as her lord </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">father was a king. King of a smoking rock in the great salt sea, yet a king nonetheless. “Her </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">fool is with her.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The old man turned away from the dawn, keeping a hand on his wyvern to steady </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="346" height="15" font="1">himself. “Help me to my chair and show them in.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Taking his arm, Pylos led him inside. In his youth, Cressen had walked briskly, but he </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was not far from his eightieth name day now, and his legs were frail and unsteady. Two years </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">past, he had fallen and shattered a hip, and it had never mended properly. Last year when he </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">took ill, the Citadel had sent Pylos out from Oldtown, mere days before Lord Stannis had </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">closed the isle . . . to help him in his labors, it was said, but Cressen knew the truth. Pylos had </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">come to replace him when he died. He did not mind. Someone must take his place, and sooner </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="155" height="15" font="1">than he would like . . . </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He let the younger man settle him behind his books and papers. “Go bring her. It is ill to </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">keep a lady waiting.” He waved a hand, a feeble gesture of haste from a man no longer </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">capable of hastening. His flesh was wrinkled and spotted, the skin so papery thin that he could </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see the web of veins and the shape of bones beneath. And how they trembled, these hands of </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">his that had once been so sure and deft . . . </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When Pylos returned the girl came with him, shy as ever. Behind her, shuffling and </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hopping in that queer sideways walk of his, came her fool. On his head was a mock helm </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fashioned from an old tin bucket, with a rack of deer antlers strapped to the crown and hung </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">with cowbells. With his every lurching step, the bells rang, each with a different voice, <i>clang-</i></text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="338" height="15" font="5"><i>a-dang bong-dong ring-a-ling clong clong clong</i>. </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“Who comes to see us so early, Pylos?” Cressen said. </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s me and Patches, Maester.” Guileless blue eyes blinked at him. Hers was not a pretty </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face, alas. The child had her lord father’s square jut of jaw and her mother’s unfortunate ears, </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">along with a disfigurement all her own, the legacy of the bout of greyscale that had almost </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">claimed her in the crib. Across half one cheek and well down her neck, her flesh was stiff and </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dead, the skin cracked and flaking, mottled black and grey and stony to the touch. “Pylos said </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">we might see the white raven.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Indeed you may,” Cressen answered. As if he would ever deny her. She had been denied </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">too often in her time. Her name was Shireen. She would be ten on her next name day, and she </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was the saddest child that Maester Cressen had ever known. <i>Her sadness is my shame</i>, the old </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">man thought, <i>another mark of my failure</i>. “Maester Pylos, do me a kindness and bring the bird </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">down from the rookery for the Lady Shireen.” </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It would be my pleasure.” Pylos was a polite youth, no more than five-and-twenty, yet </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">solemn as a man of sixty. If only he had more humor, more <i>life</i> in him; that was what was </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">needed here. Grim places needed lightening, not solemnity, and Dragonstone was grim </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">beyond a doubt, a lonely citadel in the wet waste surrounded by storm and salt, with the </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smoking shadow of the mountain at its back. A maester must go where he is sent, so Cressen </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had come here with his lord some twelve years past, and he had served, and served well. Yet </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he had never loved Dragonstone, nor ever felt truly at home here. Of late, when he woke from </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">restless dreams in which the red woman figured disturbingly, he often did not know where he </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="35" height="15" font="1">was. </text>
</page>
<page number="3" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The fool turned his patched and piebald head to watch Pylos climb the steep iron steps to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">the rookery. His bells rang with the motion. “Under the sea, the birds have scales for </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">feathers,” he said, <i>clang-a-langing</i>. “I know, I know, oh, oh, oh.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Even for a fool, Patchface was a sorry thing. Perhaps once he could evoke gales of </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">laughter with a quip, but the sea had taken that power from him, along with half his wits and </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all his memory. He was soft and obese, subject to twitches and trembles, incoherent as often </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as not. The girl was the only one who laughed at him now, the only one who cared if he lived </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">or died. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>An ugly little girl and a sad fool, and maester makes three . . . now there is a tale to make </i></text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>men weep.</i> “Sit with me, child.” Cressen beckoned her closer. “This is early to come calling, </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">scarce past dawn. You should be snug in your bed.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I had bad dreams,” Shireen told him. “About the dragons. They were coming to eat me.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The child had been plagued by nightmares as far back as Maester Cressen could recall. </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“We have talked of this before,” he said gently. “The dragons cannot come to life. They are </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">carved of stone, child. In olden days, our island was the westernmost outpost of the great </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Freehold of Valyria. It was the Valyrians who raised this citadel, and they had ways of </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shaping stone since lost to us. A castle must have towers wherever two walls meet at an angle, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">for defense. The Valyrians fashioned these towers in the shape of dragons to make their </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">fortress seem more fearsome, just as they crowned their walls with a thousand gargoyles </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">instead of simple crenellations.” He took her small pink hand in his own frail spotted one and </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="428" height="15" font="1">gave it a gentle squeeze. “So you see, there is nothing to fear.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Shireen was unconvinced. “What about the thing in the sky? Dalla and Matrice were </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">talking by the well, and Dalla said she heard the red woman tell Mother that it was </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">dragonsbreath. If the dragons are breathing, doesn’t that mean they are coming to life?” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>The red woman</i>, Maester Cressen thought sourly. <i>Ill enough that she’s filled the head of </i></text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>the mother with her madness, must she poison the daughter’s dreams as well?</i> He would have </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a stern word with Dalla, warn her not to spread such tales. “The thing in the sky is a comet, </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sweet child. A star with a tail, lost in the heavens. It will be gone soon enough, never to be </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="302" height="15" font="1">seen again in our lifetimes. Watch and see.” </text>
<text top="708" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Shireen gave a brave little nod. “Mother said the white raven means it’s not summer </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="75" height="15" font="1">anymore.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That is so, my lady. The white ravens fly only from the Citadel.” Cressen’s fingers went </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mastery of another branch of learning; the maester’s collar, mark of his order. In the pride of </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">skin. “They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="116" height="15" font="1">living memory.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">“Will it get cold now?” Shireen was a summer child, and had never known true cold. </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“In time,” Cressen replied. “If the gods are good, they will grant us a warm autumn and </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bountiful harvests, so we might prepare for the winter to come.” The smallfolk said that a </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">long summer meant an even longer winter, but the maester saw no reason to frighten the child </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">with such tales. </text>
</page>
<page number="4" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Patchface rang his bells. “It is <i>always</i> summer under the sea,” he intoned. “The merwives </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wear nennymoans in their hair and weave gowns of silver seaweed. I know, I know, oh, oh, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="33" height="15" font="1">oh.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">Shireen giggled. “I should like a gown of silver seaweed.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Under the sea, it snows up,” said the fool, “and the rain is dry as bone. I know, I know, </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">oh, oh, oh.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="257" height="15" font="1">“Will it truly snow?” the child asked. </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It will,” Cressen said. <i>But not for years yet, I pray, and then not for long.</i> “Ah, here is </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">Pylos with the bird.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Shireen gave a cry of delight. Even Cressen had to admit the bird made an impressive </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sight, white as snow and larger than any hawk, with the bright black eyes that meant it was no </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mere albino, but a truebred white raven of the Citadel. “Here,” he called. The raven spread its </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">wings, leapt into the air, and flapped noisily across the room to land on the table beside him. </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’ll see to your breakfast now,” Pylos announced. Cressen nodded. “This is the Lady </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Shireen,” he told the raven. The bird bobbed its pale head up and down, as if it were bowing. </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="191" height="15" font="1">“<i>Lady</i>,” it croaked. “<i>Lady</i>.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="286" height="15" font="1">The child’s mouth gaped open. “It <i>talks!</i>” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="369" height="15" font="1">“A few words. As I said, they are clever, these birds.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Clever bird, clever man, clever clever fool,” said Patchface, jangling. “Oh, clever clever </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">clever fool.” He began to sing. “<i>The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance </i></text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>my lord</i>,” he sang, hopping from one foot to the other and back again. “<i>The shadows come to </i></text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>stay, my lord, stay my lord, stay my lord</i>.” He jerked his head with each word, the bells in his </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">antlers sending up a clangor. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The white raven screamed and went flapping away to perch on the iron railing of the </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rookery stairs. Shireen seemed to grow smaller. “He sings that all the time. I told him to stop </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">but he won’t. It makes me scared. Make him stop.” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>And how do I do that?</i> the old man wondered. <i>Once I might have silenced him forever, </i></text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="5"><i>but now . . .</i> </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Patchface had come to them as a boy. Lord Steffon of cherished memory had found him </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in Volantis, across the narrow sea. The king—the old king, Aerys II Targaryen, who had not </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">been quite so mad in those days—had sent his lordship to seek a bride for Prince Rhaegar, </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">who had no sisters to wed. “We have found the most splendid fool,” he wrote Cressen, a </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">fortnight before he was to return home from his fruitless mission. “Only a boy, yet nimble as a </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">monkey and witty as a dozen courtiers. He juggles and riddles and does magic, and he can </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sing prettily in four tongues. We have bought his freedom and hope to bring him home with </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">us. Robert will be delighted with him, and perhaps in time he will even teach Stannis how to </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="54" height="15" font="1">laugh.” </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">It saddened Cressen to remember that letter. No one had ever taught Stannis how to </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">laugh, least of all the boy Patchface. The storm came up suddenly, howling, and Shipbreaker </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Bay proved the truth of its name. The lord’s two-masted galley <i>Windproud</i> broke up within </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sight of his castle. From its parapets his two eldest sons had watched as their father’s ship was </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smashed against the rocks and swallowed by the waters. A hundred oarsmen and sailors went </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down with Lord Steffon Baratheon and his lady wife, and for days thereafter every tide left a </text>

<text top="1040" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The boy washed up on the third day. Maester Cressen had come down with the rest, to </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wrinkled and powdered with wet sand. Cressen had thought him another corpse, but when </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jommy grabbed his ankles to drag him off to the burial wagon, the boy coughed water and sat </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">up. To his dying day, Jommy had sworn that Patchface’s flesh was clammy cold. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No one ever explained those two days the fool had been lost in the sea. The fisherfolk </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">liked to say a mermaid had taught him to breathe water in return for his seed. Patchface </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself had said nothing. The witty, clever lad that Lord Steffon had written of never reached </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End; the boy they found was someone else, broken in body and mind, hardly capable </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">of speech, much less of wit. Yet his fool’s face left no doubt of who he was. It was the fashion </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the Free City of Volantis to tattoo the faces of slaves and servants; from neck to scalp the </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="449" height="15" font="1">boy’s skin had been patterned in squares of red and green motley. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The wretch is mad, and in pain, and no use to anyone, least of all himself,” declared old </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ser Harbert, the castellan of Storm’s End in those years. “The kindest thing you could do for </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that one is fill his cup with the milk of the poppy. A painless sleep, and there’s an end to it. </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He’d bless you if he had the wit for it.” But Cressen had refused, and in the end he had won. </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Whether Patchface had gotten any joy of that victory he could not say, not even today, so </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">many years later. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, dance my lord</i>,” the fool sang on, </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="636" height="15" font="1">swinging his head and making his bells clang and clatter. <i>Bong dong, ring-a-ling, bong dong</i>. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“<i>Lord</i>,” the white raven shrieked. “<i>Lord, lord, lord</i>.” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A fool sings what he will,” the maester told his anxious princess. “You must not take his </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">words to heart. On the morrow he may remember another song, and this one will never be </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="541" height="15" font="1">heard again.” <i>He can sing prettily in four tongues</i>, Lord Steffon had written . . . </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">Pylos strode through the door. “Maester, pardons.” </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="591" height="15" font="1">“You have forgotten the porridge,” Cressen said, amused. That was most unlike Pylos. </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Maester, Ser Davos returned last night. They were talking of it in the kitchen. I thought </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="1">you would want to know at once.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">“Davos . . . last night, you say? Where is he?” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="412" height="15" font="1">“With the king. They have been together most of the night.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There was a time when Lord Stannis would have woken him, no matter the hour, to have </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him there to give his counsel. “I should have been told,” Cressen complained. “I should have </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">been woken.” He disentangled his fingers from Shireen’s. “Pardons, my lady, but I must </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">speak with your lord father. Pylos, give me your arm. There are too many steps in this castle, </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">and it seems to me they add a few every night, just to vex me.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Shireen and Patchface followed them out, but the child soon grew restless with the old </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man’s creeping pace and dashed ahead, the fool lurching after her with his cowbells clanging </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">madly. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Castles are not friendly places for the frail, Cressen was reminded as he descended the </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">turnpike stairs of Sea Dragon Tower. Lord Stannis would be found in the Chamber of the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Painted Table, atop the Stone Drum, Dragonstone’s central keep, so named for the way its </text>

<text top="956" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pass through the middle and inner walls with their guardian gargoyles and black iron gates, </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and ascend more steps than Cressen cared to contemplate. Young men climbed steps two at a </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">time; for old men with bad hips, every one was a torment. But Lord Stannis would not think </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to come to him, so the maester resigned himself to the ordeal. He had Pylos to help him, at the </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">least, and for that he was grateful. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Shuffling along the gallery, they passed before a row of tall arched windows with </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">commanding views of the outer bailey, the curtain wall, and the fishing village beyond. In the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yard, archers were firing at practice butts to the call of “Notch, draw, loose.” Their arrows </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">made a sound like a flock of birds taking wing. Guardsmen strode the wallwalks, peering </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">between the gargoyles on the host camped without. The morning air was hazy with the smoke </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of cookfires, as three thousand men sat down to break their fasts beneath the banners of their </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lords. Past the sprawl of the camp, the anchorage was crowded with ships. No craft that had </text>

<text top="279" left="139" width="426" height="15" font="1">some of the big-bellied carracks and cogs that surrounded her. </text>
<text top="304" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The guardsmen outside the Stone Drum knew the maesters by sight, and passed them </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="522" height="15" font="1">through. “Wait here,” Cressen told Pylos, within. “It’s best I see him alone.” </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="202" height="15" font="1">“It is a long climb, Maester.” </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cressen smiled. “You think I have forgotten? I have climbed these steps so often I know </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="138" height="15" font="1">each one by name.” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Halfway up, he regretted his decision. He had stopped to catch his breath and ease the </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">pain in his hip when he heard the scuff of boots on stone, and came face-to-face with Ser </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="1">Davos Seaworth, descending. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos was a slight man, his low birth written plain upon a common face. A well-worn </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">green cloak, stained by salt and spray and faded from the sun, draped his thin shoulders, over </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">brown doublet and breeches that matched brown eyes and hair. About his neck a pouch of </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">worn leather hung from a thong. His small beard was well-peppered with grey, and he wore a </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">leather glove on his maimed left hand. When he saw Cressen, he checked his descent. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="378" height="15" font="1">“Ser Davos,” the maester said. “When did you return?” </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“In the black of morning. My favorite time.” It was said that no one had ever handled a </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ship by night half so well as Davos Shorthand. Before Lord Stannis had knighted him, he had </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="503" height="15" font="1">been the most notorious and elusive smuggler in all the Seven Kingdoms. </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="56" height="15" font="1">“And?” </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The man shook his head. “It is as you warned him. They will not rise, Maester. Not for </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">him. They do not love him.” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>No</i>, Cressen thought. <i>Nor will they ever. He is strong, able,  just . . . aye,  just  past  the </i></text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="5"><i>point of wisdom . . . yet it is not enough. It has never been enough.</i> “You spoke to them all?” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“All? No. Only those that would see me. They do not love me either, these highborns. To </text>

<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis had hacked the ends off at the last joint, all but the thumb. “I broke bread with Gulian </text>

<text top="937" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Renly’s made his own Kingsguard,” the onetime smuggler explained, “but these seven </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="590" height="15" font="1">don’t wear white. Each one has his own color. Loras Tyrell’s their Lord Commander.” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was just the sort of notion that would appeal to Renly Baratheon; a splendid new order </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of knighthood, with gorgeous new raiment to proclaim it. Even as a boy, Renly had loved </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bright colors and rich fabrics, and he had loved his games as well. “Look at me!” he would </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shout as he ran laughing through the halls of Storm’s End. “Look at me, I’m a dragon,” or </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">The bold little boy with wild black hair and laughing eyes was a man grown now, one-</text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and-twenty, and still he played his games. <i>Look at me, I’m a king</i>, Cressen thought sadly. <i>Oh, </i></text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Renly, Renly, dear sweet child, do you know what you are doing? And would you care if you </i></text>

<text top="182" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">refusals?” he asked Ser Davos. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Well, as to that, some gave me soft words and some blunt, some made excuses, some </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">promises, some only lied.” He shrugged. “In the end words are just wind.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="1">“You could bring him no hope?” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="560" height="15" font="1">“Only the false sort, and I’d not do that,” Davos said. “He had the truth from me.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Maester Cressen remembered the day Davos had been knighted, after the siege of </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End. Lord Stannis and a small garrison had held the castle for close to a year, against </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the great host of the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne. Even the sea was closed against them, </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watched day and night by Redwyne galleys flying the burgundy banners of the Arbor. Within </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End, the horses had long since been eaten, the dogs and cats were gone, and the </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">garrison was down to roots and rats. Then came a night when the moon was new and black </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">clouds hid the stars. Cloaked in that darkness, Davos the smuggler had dared the Redwyne </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cordon and the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay alike. His little ship had a black hull, black sails, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">black oars, and a hold crammed with onions and salt fish. Little enough, yet it had kept the </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">garrison alive long enough for Eddard Stark to reach Storm’s End and break the siege. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Stannis had rewarded Davos with choice lands on Cape Wrath, a small keep, and a </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knight’s honors . . . but he had also decreed that he lose a joint of each finger on his left hand, </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to pay for all his years of smuggling. Davos had submitted, on the condition that Stannis </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wield the knife himself; he would accept no punishment from lesser hands. The lord had used </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a butcher’s cleaver, the better to cut clean and true. Afterward, Davos had chosen the name </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Seaworth for his new-made house, and he took for his banner a black ship on a pale grey </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">field—with an onion on its sails. The onetime smuggler was fond of saying that Lord Stannis </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="1">had done him a boon, by giving him four less fingernails to clean and trim. </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No, Cressen thought, a man like that would give no false hope, nor soften a hard truth. </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Ser Davos, truth can be a bitter draught, even for a man like Lord Stannis. He thinks only of </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">returning to King’s Landing in the fullness of his power, to tear down his enemies and claim </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">what is rightfully his. Yet now . . .” </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If he takes this meager host to King’s Landing, it will be only to die. He does not have </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the numbers. I told him as much, but you know his pride.” Davos held up his gloved hand. </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">“My fingers will grow back before that man bends to sense.” </text>
<text top="811" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The old man sighed. “You have done all you could. Now I must add my voice to yours.” </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">Wearily, he resumed his climb. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Stannis Baratheon’s refuge was a great round room with walls of bare black stone </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and four tall narrow windows that looked out to the four points of the compass. In the center </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the chamber was the great table from which it took its name, a massive slab of carved wood </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fashioned at the command of Aegon Targaryen in the days before the Conquest. The Painted </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Table was more than fifty feet long, perhaps half that wide at its widest point, but less than </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">four feet across at its narrowest. Aegon’s carpenters had shaped it after the land of Westeros, </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">sawing out each bay and peninsula until the table nowhere ran straight. On its surface, </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">darkened by near three hundred years of varnish, were painted the Seven Kingdoms as they </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="572" height="15" font="1">had been in Aegon’s day; rivers and mountains, castles and cities, lakes and forests. </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">There was a single chair in the room, carefully positioned in the precise place that </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Dragonstone occupied off the coast of Westeros, and raised up to give a good view of the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">tabletop. Seated in the chair was a man in a tight-laced leather jerkin and breeches of </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">roughspun brown wool. When Maester Cressen entered, he glanced up. “I knew <i>you</i> would </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">come, old man, whether I summoned you or no.” There was no hint of warmth in his voice; </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="126" height="15" font="1">there seldom was. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis Baratheon, Lord of Dragonstone and by the grace of the gods rightful heir to the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, was broad of shoulder and sinewy of limb, </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with a tightness to his face and flesh that spoke of leather cured in the sun until it was as </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tough as steel. <i>Hard</i> was the word men used when they spoke of Stannis, and hard he was. </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Though he was not yet five-and-thirty, only a fringe of thin black hair remained on his head, </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">circling behind his ears like the shadow of a crown. His brother, the late King Robert, had </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">grown a beard in his final years. Maester Cressen had never seen it, but they said it was a wild </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thing, thick and fierce. As if in answer, Stannis kept his own whiskers cropped tight and short. </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">They lay like a blue-black shadow across his square jaw and the bony hollows of his cheeks. </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">His eyes were open wounds beneath his heavy brows, a blue as dark as the sea by night. His </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mouth would have given despair to even the drollest of fools; it was a mouth made for frowns </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and scowls and sharply worded commands, all thin pale lips and clenched muscles, a mouth </text>
<text top="421" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that had forgotten how to smile and had never known how to laugh. Sometimes when the </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">world grew very still and silent of a night, Maester Cressen fancied he could hear Lord </text>
<text top="460" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">Stannis grinding his teeth half a castle away. </text>
<text top="485" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“Once you would have woken me,” the old man said. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Once you were young. Now you are old and sick, and need your sleep.” Stannis had </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">never learned to soften his speech, to dissemble or flatter; he said what he thought, and those </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that did not like it could be damned. “I knew you’d learn what Davos had to say soon enough. </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">You always do, don’t you?” </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="571" height="15" font="1">“I would be of no help to you if I did not,” Cressen said. “I met Davos on the stair.” </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And he told all, I suppose? I should have had the man’s tongue shortened along with his </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="1">fingers.” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">“He would have made you a poor envoy then.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He made me a poor envoy in any case. The storm lords will not rise for me. It seems </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they do not like me, and the justice of my cause means nothing to them. The cravenly ones </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will sit behind their walls waiting to see how the wind rises and who is likely to triumph. The </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bold ones have already declared for Renly. For <i>Renly!</i>” He spat out the name like poison on </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="79" height="15" font="1">his tongue. </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Your brother has been the Lord of Storm’s End these past thirteen years. These lords are </text>

<text top="836" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“<i>His</i>,” Stannis broke in, “when by rights they should be mine. I never asked for </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">Dragonstone. I never wanted it. I took it because Robert’s enemies were here and he </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">commanded me to root them out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutiful as a younger </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me. And what was Robert’s thanks? He </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">names me Lord of Dragonstone, and gives Storm’s End and its incomes to <i>Renly</i>. Storm’s End </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">belonged to House Baratheon for three hundred years; by rights it should have passed to me </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">when Robert took the Iron Throne.” </text>
<text top="978" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was an old grievance, deeply felt, and never more so than now. Here was the heart of </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">his lord’s weakness; for Dragonstone, old and strong though it was, commanded the </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">allegiance of only a handful of lesser lords, whose stony island holdings were too thinly </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">peopled to yield up the men that Stannis needed. Even with the sellswords he had brought </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">across the narrow sea from the Free Cities of Myr and Lys, the host camped outside his walls </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="429" height="15" font="1">was far too small to bring down the power of House Lannister. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Robert did you an injustice,” Maester Cressen replied carefully, “yet he had sound </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">reasons. Dragonstone had long been the seat of House Targaryen. He needed a man’s strength </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">to rule here, and Renly was but a child.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“He is a child still,” Stannis declared, his anger ringing loud in the empty hall, “a </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thieving child who thinks to snatch the crown off my brow. What has Renly ever done to earn </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a throne? He sits in council and jests with Littlefinger, and at tourneys he dons his splendid </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">suit of armor and allows himself to be knocked off his horse by a better man. That is the sum </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of my brother Renly, who thinks he ought to be a king. I ask you, why did the gods inflict me </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">with <i>brothers?</i>” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="216" height="15" font="1">“I cannot answer for the gods.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“You seldom answer at all these days, it seems to me. Who maesters for Renly? </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Perchance I should send for him, I might like his counsel better. What do you think this </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">maester said when my brother decided to steal my crown? What counsel did your colleague </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="243" height="15" font="1">offer to this traitor blood of mine?” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It would surprise me if Lord Renly sought counsel, Your Grace.” The youngest of Lord </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Steffon’s three sons had grown into a man bold but heedless, who acted from impulse rather </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">than calculation. In that, as in so much else, Renly was like his brother Robert, and utterly </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">unlike Stannis. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Your Grace</i>,” Stannis repeated bitterly. “You mock me with a king’s style, yet what am </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">I king of? Dragonstone and a few rocks in the narrow sea, there is my kingdom.” He </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">descended the steps of his chair to stand before the table, his shadow falling across the mouth </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of the Blackwater Rush and the painted forest where King’s Landing now stood. There he </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stood, brooding over the realm he sought to claim, so near at hand and yet so far away. </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“Tonight I am to sup with my lords bannermen, such as they are. Celtigar, Velaryon, Bar </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Emmon, the whole paltry lot of them. A poor crop, if truth be told, but they are what my </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brothers have left me. That Lysene pirate Salladhor Saan will be there with the latest tally of </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">what I owe him, and Morosh the Myrman will caution me with talk of tides and autumn gales, </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">while Lord Sunglass mutters piously of the will of the Seven. Celtigar will want to know </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">which storm lords are joining us. Velaryon will threaten to take his levies home unless we </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="421" height="15" font="1">strike at once. What am I to tell them? What must I do now?” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your true enemies are the Lannisters, my lord,” Maester Cressen answered. “If you and </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="404" height="15" font="1">your brother were to make common cause against them—” </text>
<text top="811" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I will not treat with Renly,” Stannis answered in a tone that brooked no argument. “Not </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">while he calls himself a king.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Not Renly, then,” the maester yielded. His lord was stubborn and proud; when he had </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">set his mind, there was no changing it. “Others might serve your needs as well. Eddard Stark’s </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">son has been proclaimed King in the North, with all the power of Winterfell and Riverrun </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="93" height="15" font="1">behind him.” </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="588" height="15" font="1">“A green boy,” said Stannis, “and another false king. Am I to accept a broken realm?” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Surely half a kingdom is better than none,” Cressen said, “and if you help the boy </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">avenge his father’s murder—” </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why should I avenge Eddard Stark? The man was nothing to me. Oh, <i>Robert</i> loved him, </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to be sure. Loved him as a brother, how often did I hear that? <i>I</i> was his brother, not Ned Stark, </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but you would never have known it by the way he treated me. I held Storm’s End for him, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">walls. Did Robert thank me? No. He thanked <i>Stark</i>, for lifting the siege when we were down </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to rats and radishes. I built a fleet at Robert’s command, took Dragonstone in his name. Did </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he take my hand and say, <i>Well done, brother, whatever should I do without you?</i> No, he </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">blamed me for letting Willem Darry steal away Viserys and the babe, as if I could have </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stopped it. I sat on his council for fifteen years, helping Jon Arryn rule his realm while Robert </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">drank and whored, but when Jon died, did my brother name me his Hand? No, he went </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">galloping off to his dear friend Ned Stark, and offered him the honor. And small good it did </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">either of them.” </text>
<text top="265" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Be that as it may, my lord,” Maester Cressen said gently. “Great wrongs have been done </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you, but the past is dust. The future may yet be won if you join with the Starks. There are </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">others you might sound out as well. What of Lady Arryn? If the queen murdered her husband, </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">surely she will want justice for him. She has a young son, Jon Arryn’s heir. If you were to </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="181" height="15" font="1">betroth Shireen to him—” </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The boy is weak and sickly,” Lord Stannis objected. “Even his father saw how it was, </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">when he asked me to foster him on Dragonstone. Service as a page might have done him </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">good, but that damnable Lannister woman had Lord Arryn poisoned before it could be done, </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">and now Lysa hides him in the Eyrie. She’ll never part with the boy, I promise you that.” </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then you must send Shireen to the Eyrie,” the maester urged. “Dragonstone is a grim </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="584" height="15" font="1">home for a child. Let her fool go with her, so she will have a familiar face about her.” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Familiar and hideous.” Stannis furrowed his brow in thought. “Still . . . perhaps it is </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="146" height="15" font="1">worth the trying . . .” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Must the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms beg for help from widow women and </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">usurpers?” a woman’s voice asked sharply. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Maester Cressen turned and bowed his head. “My lady,” he said, chagrined that he had </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">not heard her enter. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="575" height="15" font="1">Lord Stannis scowled. “I do not beg. Of anyone. Mind you remember that, woman.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am pleased to hear it, my lord.” Lady Selyse was as tall as her husband, thin of body </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and thin of face, with prominent ears, a sharp nose, and the faintest hint of a mustache on her </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">upper lip. She plucked it daily and cursed it regularly, yet it never failed to return. Her eyes </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were pale, her mouth stern, her voice a whip. She cracked it now. “Lady Arryn owes you her </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">allegiance, as do the Starks, your brother Renly, and all the rest. You are their one true king. It </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would not be fitting to plead and bargain with them for what is rightfully yours by the grace </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">of god.” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>God</i>, she said, not <i>gods</i>. The red woman had won her, heart and soul, turning her from </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the gods of the Seven Kingdoms, both old and new, to worship the one they called the Lord of </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">Light. </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your god can keep his grace,” said Lord Stannis, who did not share his wife’s fervent </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">new faith. “It’s swords I need, not blessings. Do you have an army hidden somewhere that </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">you’ve not told me of?” There was no affection in his tone. Stannis had always been </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">uncomfortable around women, even his own wife. When he had gone to King’s Landing to sit </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on Robert’s council, he had left Selyse on Dragonstone with their daughter. His letters had </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been few, his visits fewer; he did his duty in the marriage bed once or twice a year, but took </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">no joy in it, and the sons he had once hoped for had never come. </text>

<text top="1048" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“House Florent can field two thousand swords at best.” It was said that Stannis knew the </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“There is another way.” Lady Selyse moved closer. “Look out your windows, my lord. </text>

<text top="265" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">embrace the power of the Lord of Light.” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="598" height="15" font="1">“How many swords will the Lord of Light put into my hand?” Stannis demanded again. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“All you need,” his wife promised, “The swords of Storm’s End and Highgarden for a </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="252" height="15" font="1">start, and all their lords bannermen.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Davos would tell you different,” Stannis said. “Those swords are sworn to Renly. They </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">love my charming young brother, as they once loved Robert . . . and as they have never loved </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” she answered, “but if Renly should die . . .” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stannis looked at his lady with narrowed eyes, until Cressen could not hold his tongue. </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">“It is not to be thought. Your Grace, whatever follies Renly has committed—” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Follies?</i> I call them treasons.” Stannis turned back to his wife. “My brother is young and </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="524" height="15" font="1">strong, and he has a vast host around him, and these rainbow knights of his.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="409" height="15" font="1">“Melisandre has gazed into the flames, and seen him dead.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Cressen was horrorstruck. “Fratricide . . . my lord, this is <i>evil</i>,  unthinkable . . . please, </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">listen to me.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lady Selyse gave him a measured look. “And what will you tell him, Maester? How he </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">might win half a kingdom if he goes to the Starks on his knees and sells our daughter to Lysa </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">Arryn?” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have heard your counsel, Cressen,” Lord Stannis said. “Now I will hear hers. You are </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">dismissed.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Maester Cressen bent a stiff knee. He could feel Lady Selyse’s eyes on his back as he </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shuffled slowly across the room. By the time he reached the bottom of the steps it was all he </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="359" height="15" font="1">could do to stand erect. “Help me,” he said to Pylos. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">When he was safe back in his own rooms, Cressen sent the younger man away and </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">limped to his balcony once more, to stand between his gargoyles and stare out to sea. One of </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Salladhor Saan’s warships was sweeping past the castle, her gaily-striped hull slicing through </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the grey-green waters as her oars rose and fell. He watched until she vanished behind a </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">headland. <i>Would that my fears could vanish so easily.</i> Had he lived so long for this? </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When a maester donned his collar, he put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">felt a father nonetheless. Robert, Stannis, Renly . . . three sons he had raised after the angry </text>

<text top="943" left="139" width="259" height="15" font="1">could not allow it, <i>would</i> not allow it. </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The woman was the heart of it. Not the Lady Selyse, the <i>other</i> one. The red woman, the </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">His chambers seemed dim and gloomy after the brightness of the morning. With </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fumbling hands, the old man lit a candle and carried it to the workroom beneath the rookery </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">stair, where his ointments, potions, and medicines stood neatly on their shelves. On the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bottom shelf behind a row of salves in squat clay jars he found a vial of indigo glass, no larger </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than his little finger. It rattled when he shook it. Cressen blew away a layer of dust and carried </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">it back to his table. Collapsing into his chair, he pulled the stopper and spilled out the vial’s </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">contents. A dozen crystals, no larger than seeds, rattled across the parchment he’d been </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">reading. They shone like jewels in the candlelight, so purple that the maester found himself </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">thinking that he had never truly seen the color before. </text>
<text top="285" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The chain around his throat felt very heavy. He touched one of the crystals lightly with </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the tip of his little finger. <i>Such a small thing to hold the power of life and death.</i> It was made </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from a certain plant that grew only on the islands of the Jade Sea, half a world away. The </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">leaves had to be aged, and soaked in a wash of limes and sugar water and certain rare spices </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from the Summer Isles. Afterward they could be discarded, but the potion must be thickened </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with ash and allowed to crystallize. The process was slow and difficult, the necessaries costly </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and hard to acquire. The alchemists of Lys knew the way of it, though, and the Faceless Men </text>
<text top="421" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Braavos . . . and the maesters of his order as well, though it was not something talked about </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beyond the walls of the Citadel. All the world knew that a maester forged his silver link when </text>
<text top="460" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he learned the art of healing—but the world preferred to forget that men who knew how to </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">heal also knew how to kill. </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cressen no longer recalled the name the Asshai’i gave the leaf, or the Lysene poisoners </text>
<text top="524" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the crystal. In the Citadel, it was simply called the strangler. Dissolved in wine, it would make </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the muscles of a man’s throat clench tighter than any fist, shutting off his windpipe. They said </text>
<text top="563" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a victim’s face turned as purple as the little crystal seed from which his death was grown, but </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="316" height="15" font="1">so too did a man choking on a morsel of food. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And this very night Lord Stannis would feast his bannermen, his lady wife . . . and the </text>

<text top="652" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>I must rest</i>, Maester Cressen told himself. <i>I must have all my strength come dark. My </i></text>

<text top="711" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">refresh him for the ordeal ahead. Wearily, he tottered off to his bed. Yet when he closed his </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">eyes, he could still see the light of the comet, red and fiery and vividly alive amidst the </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">darkness of his dreams. <i>Perhaps it is my comet</i>, he thought drowsily at the last, just before </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="442" height="15" font="1">sleep took him. <i>An omen of blood, foretelling murder</i> . . . <i>yes</i> . . . </text>
<text top="794" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When he woke it was full dark, his bedchamber was black, and every joint in his body </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">ached. Cressen pushed himself up, his head throbbing. Clutching for his cane, he rose </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">unsteady to his feet. <i>So late</i>, he thought. <i>They did not summon me.</i> He was always summoned </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for feasts, seated near the salt, close to Lord Stannis. His lord’s face swam up before him, not </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the man he was but the boy he had been, standing cold in the shadows while the sun shone on </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his elder brother. Whatever he did, Robert had done first, and better. Poor boy . . . he must </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">hurry, for <i>his</i> sake. </text>
<text top="936" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The maester found the crystals where he had left them, and scooped them off the </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">parchment. Cressen owned no hollow rings, such as the poisoners of Lys were said to favor, </text>
<text top="975" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but a myriad of pockets great and small were sewn inside the loose sleeves of his robe. He </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">secreted the strangler seeds in one of them, threw open his door, and called, “Pylos? Where </text>
<text top="1014" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">are you?” When he heard no reply, he called again, louder. “Pylos, I need help.” Still there </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">came no answer. That was queer; the young maester had his cell only a half turn down the </text>
<text top="1053" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">stair, within easy earshot. </text>
</page>
<page number="13" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In the end, Cressen had to shout for the servants. “Make haste,” he told them. “I have </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">slept too long. They will be feasting by now . . . drinking . . . I should have been woken.” </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="465" height="15" font="1">What had happened to Maester Pylos? Truly, he did not understand. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Again he had to cross the long gallery. A night wind whispered through the great </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">windows, sharp with the smell of the sea. Torches flickered along the walls of Dragonstone, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and in the camp beyond, he could see hundreds of cookfires burning, as if a field of stars had </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fallen to the earth. Above, the comet blazed red and malevolent. <i>I am too old and wise to fear </i></text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="5"><i>such things</i>, the maester told himself. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The doors to the Great Hall were set in the mouth of a stone dragon. He told the servants </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to leave him outside. It would be better to enter alone; he must not appear feeble. Leaning </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">heavily on his cane, Cressen climbed the last few steps and hobbled beneath the gateway </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">teeth. A pair of guardsmen opened the heavy red doors before him, unleashing a sudden blast </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">of noise and light. Cressen stepped down into the dragon’s maw. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Over the clatter of knife and plate and the low mutter of table talk, he heard Patchface </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">singing, “<i>. . . dance, my lord, dance my lord</i>,” to the accompaniment of jangling cowbells. </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The same dreadful song he’d sung this morning. “<i>The shadows come to stay, my lord, stay my </i></text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>lord, stay my lord.</i>” The lower tables were crowded with knights, archers, and sellsword </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">captains, tearing apart loaves of black bread to soak in their fish stew. Here there was no loud </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">laughter, no raucous shouting such as marred the dignity of other men’s feasts; Lord Stannis </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">did not permit such. </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cressen made his way toward the raised platform where the lords sat with the king. He </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had to step wide around Patchface. Dancing, his bells ringing, the fool neither saw nor heard </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">his approach. As he hopped from one leg to the other, Patchface lurched into Cressen, </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knocking his cane out from under him. They went crashing down together amidst the rushes </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in a tangle of arms and legs, while a sudden gale of laughter went up around them. No doubt it </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">was a comical sight. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Patchface sprawled half on top of him, motley fool’s face pressed close to his own. He </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had lost his tin helm with its antlers and bells. “Under the sea, you fall <i>up</i>,” he declared. “I </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">know, I know, oh, oh, oh.” Giggling, the fool rolled off, bounded to his feet, and did a little </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">dance. </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Trying to make the best of it, the maester smiled feebly and struggled to rise, but his hip </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was in such pain that for a moment he was half afraid that he had broken it all over again. He </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">felt strong hands grasp him under the arms and lift him back to his feet. “Thank you, ser,” he </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">murmured, turning to see which knight had come to his aid . . . </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Maester,” said Lady Melisandre, her deep voice flavored with the music of the Jade Sea. </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">“You ought take more care.” As ever, she wore red head to heel, a long loose gown of flowing </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silk as bright as fire, with dagged sleeves and deep slashes in the bodice that showed glimpses </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of a darker blood-red fabric beneath. Around her throat was a red-gold choker tighter than any </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">maester’s chain, ornamented with a single great ruby. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Her hair was not the orange or strawberry color of common red-haired men, but a deep </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">burnished copper that shone in the light of the torches. Even her eyes were red . . . but her </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">skin was smooth and white, unblemished, pale as cream. Slender she was, graceful, taller than </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">most knights, with full breasts and narrow waist and a heart-shaped face. Men’s eyes that </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">once found her did not quickly look away, not even a maester’s eyes. Many called her </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">beautiful. She was not beautiful. She was red, and terrible, and red. </text>
<text top="1031" left="171" width="190" height="15" font="1">“I . . . thank you, my lady.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A man your age must look to where he steps,” Melisandre said courteously. “The night </text>

<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>own.</i> “Only children fear the dark,” he told her. Yet even as he said the words, he heard </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Patchface take up his song again. “<i>The shadows come to dance, my lord, dance my lord, </i></text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="5"><i>dance my lord.</i>” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Now here is a riddle,” Melisandre said. “A clever fool and a foolish wise man.” </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Bending, she picked up Patchface’s helm from where it had fallen and set it on Cressen’s </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">head. The cowbells rang softly as the tin bucket slid down over his ears. “A crown to match </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">your chain, Lord Maester,” she announced. All around them, men were laughing. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cressen pressed his lips together and fought to still his rage. She thought he was feeble </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and helpless, but she would learn otherwise before the night was done. Old he might be, yet </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he was still a maester of the Citadel. “I need no crown but truth,” he told her, removing the </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">fool’s helm from his head. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“There are truths in this world that are not taught at Oldtown.” Melisandre turned from </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him in a swirl of red silk and made her way back to the high table, where King Stannis and his </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">queen were seated. Cressen handed the antlered tin bucket back to Patchface, and made to </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">follow. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="209" height="15" font="1">Maester Pylos sat in his place. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The old man could only stop and stare. “Maester Pylos,” he said at last. “You . . . you did </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">not wake me.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“His Grace commanded me to let you rest.” Pylos had at least the grace to blush. “He </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">told me you were not needed here.” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cressen looked over the knights and captains and lords sitting silent. Lord Celtigar, aged </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and sour, wore a mantle patterned with red crabs picked out in garnets. Handsome Lord </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Velaryon chose sea-green silk, the white-gold seahorse at his throat matching his long fair </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hair. Lord Bar Emmon, that plump boy of fourteen, was swathed in purple velvet trimmed </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with white seal, Ser Axell Florent remained homely even in russet and fox fur, pious Lord </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Sunglass wore moonstones at throat and wrist and finger, and the Lysene captain Salladhor </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Saan was a sunburst of scarlet satin, gold, and jewels. Only Ser Davos dressed simply, in </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="641" height="15" font="1">brown doublet and green wool mantle, and only Ser Davos met his gaze, with pity in his eyes. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You are too ill and too confused to be of use to me, old man.” It sounded so like Lord </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis’s voice, but it could not be, it could not. “Pylos will counsel me henceforth. Already </text>

<text top="842" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Cressen blinked. <i>Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must </i></text>

<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>needed me most.</i> Yet all he said was, “As you command, my lord, but<i> . . . </i>but I am hungry. </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">Might not I have a place at your table?” <i>At your side, I belong at your side . . .</i> </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Davos rose from the bench. “I should be honored if the maester would sit here beside </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“As you will.” Lord Stannis turned away to say something to Melisandre, who had seated </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">herself at his right hand, in the place of high honor. Lady Selyse was on his left, flashing a </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Too far</i>, Cressen thought dully, looking at where Ser Davos was seated. Half of the lords </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Patchface was capering about as the maester made his slow way around the table to </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Davos Seaworth. “Here we eat fish,” the fool declared happily, waving a cod about like a </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Ser Davos moved aside to make room on the bench. “We all should be in motley </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tonight,” he said gloomily as Cressen seated himself, “for this is fool’s business we’re about. </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The red woman has seen victory in her flames, so Stannis means to press his claim, no matter </text>

<text top="335" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cressen slid his hands up into his sleeves as if for warmth. His fingers found the hard </text>

<text top="380" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis turned from the red woman, but it was Lady Selyse who replied. “<i>King</i> Stannis. </text>

<text top="424" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“He is old, his mind wanders,” the king told her gruffly. “What is it, Cressen? Speak your </text>

<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As you intend to sail, it is vital that you make common cause with Lord Stark and Lady </text>

<text top="514" left="171" width="423" height="15" font="1">“I make common cause with no one,” Stannis Baratheon said. </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="590" height="15" font="1">“No more than light makes common cause with darkness.” Lady Selyse took his hand. </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis nodded. “The Starks seek to steal half my kingdom, even as the Lannisters have </text>

<text top="628" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="5"><i>I have lost him</i>, Cressen thought, despairing. If only he could somehow approach </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Melisandre unseen . . . he needed but an instant’s access to her cup. “You are the rightful heir </text>

<text top="731" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He has an ally,” Lady Selyse said. “R’hllor, the Lord of Light, the Heart of Fire, the </text>

<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Gods make uncertain allies at best,” the old man insisted, “and <i>that</i> one has no power </text>

<text top="820" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You think not?” The ruby at Melisandre’s throat caught the light as she turned her head, </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and for an instant it seemed to glow bright as the comet. “If you will speak such folly, </text>

<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” Lady Selyse agreed. “Patches’s helm. It suits you well, old man. Put it on again, I </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bowed his head beneath the weight. His bells clanged. “Perhaps he ought sing his counsel </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">henceforth,” Lady Selyse said. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You go too far, woman,” Lord Stannis said. “He is an old man, and he’s served me </text>

<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">found a hard flake of crystal in his sleeve, held it tight between thumb and forefinger as he </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">reached for the cup. <i>Smooth motions, deft, I must not fumble now</i>, he prayed, and the gods </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were kind. In the blink of an eye, his fingers were empty. His hands had not been so steady </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for years, nor half so fluid. Davos saw, but no one else, he was certain. Cup in hand, he rose </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to his feet. “Mayhaps I have been a fool. Lady Melisandre, will you share a cup of wine with </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">me? A cup in honor of your god, your Lord of Light? A cup to toast his power?” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">The red woman studied him. “If you wish.” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He could feel them all watching him. Davos clutched at him as he left the bench, </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">catching his sleeve with the fingers that Lord Stannis had shortened. “What are you doing?” </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">he whispered. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A thing that must be done,” Maester Cressen answered, “for the sake of the realm, and </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">the soul of my lord.” He shook off Davos’s hand, spilling a drop of wine on the rushes. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She met him beneath the high table with every man’s eyes upon them. But Cressen saw </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only her. Red silk, red eyes, the ruby red at her throat, red lips curled in a faint smile as she </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">put her hand atop his own, around the cup. Her skin felt hot, feverish. “It is not too late to spill </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">the wine, Maester.” </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“No,” he whispered hoarsely. “No.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“As you will.” Melisandre of Asshai took the cup from his hands and drank long and </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">deep. There was only half a swallow of wine remaining when she offered it back to him. “And </text>

<text top="700" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His hands were shaking, but he made himself be strong. A maester of the Citadel must </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not be afraid. The wine was sour on his tongue. He let the empty cup drop from his fingers to </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">shatter on the floor. “He <i>does</i> have power here, my lord,” the woman said. “And fire </text>

<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">But she knew it wouldn’t, and anyhow Sansa was still in the city and would wash away too. </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="497" height="15" font="1">When she remembered that, Arya decided to wish for Winterfell instead. </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yoren was wrong about the pissing, though. That wasn’t the hardest part at all; Lommy </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Greenhands and Hot Pie were the hardest part. Orphan boys. Yoren had plucked some from </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the streets with promises of food for their bellies and shoes for their feet. The rest he’d found </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in chains. “The Watch needs good men,” he told them as they set out, “but you lot will have </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">to do.” </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yoren had taken grown men from the dungeons as well, thieves and poachers and rapers </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and the like. The worst were the three he’d found in the black cells who must have scared </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">even him, because he kept them fettered hand and foot in the back of a wagon, and vowed </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">they’d stay in irons all the way to the Wall. One had no nose, only the hole in his face where it </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had been cut off, and the gross fat bald one with the pointed teeth and the weeping sores on </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">his cheeks had eyes like nothing human. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They took five wagons out of King’s Landing, laden with supplies for the Wall: hides </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and bolts of cloth, bars of pig iron, a cage of ravens, books and paper and ink, a bale of </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sourleaf, jars of oil, and chests of medicine and spices. Teams of plow horses pulled the </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wagons, and Yoren had bought two coursers and a half-dozen donkeys for the boys. Arya </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="578" height="15" font="1">would have preferred a real horse, but the donkey was better than riding on a wagon. </text>
<text top="819" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The men paid her no mind, but she was not so lucky with the boys. She was two years </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">younger than the youngest orphan, not to mention smaller and skinnier, and Lommy and Hot </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Pie took her silence to mean she was scared, or stupid, or deaf. “Look at that sword </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lumpyhead’s got there,” Lommy said one morning as they made their plodding way past </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">orchards and wheat fields. He’d been a dyer’s apprentice before he was caught stealing, and </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his arms were mottled green to the elbow. When he laughed he brayed like the donkeys they </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">were riding. “Where’s a gutter rat like Lumpyhead get him a sword?” </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya chewed her lip sullenly. She could see the back of Yoren’s faded black cloak up </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="532" height="15" font="1">ahead of the wagons, but she was determined not to go crying to him for help. </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Maybe he’s a little squire,” Hot Pie put in. His mother had been a baker before she died, </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and he’d pushed her cart through the streets all day, shouting “<i>Hot pies! Hot pies!</i>” “Some </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="266" height="15" font="1">lordy lord’s little squire boy, that’s it.” </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">play sword made of tin.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Arya hated them making fun of Needle. “It’s castle-forged steel, you stupid,” she </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">snapped, turning in the saddle to glare at them, “and you better shut your mouth.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The orphan boys hooted. “Where’d you get a blade like that, Lumpyface?” Hot Pie </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="117" height="15" font="1">wanted to know. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="382" height="15" font="1">“Lumpy<i>head</i>,” corrected Lommy. “He prob’ly stole it.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I did <i>not!</i>” she shouted. Jon Snow had given her Needle. Maybe she had to let them call </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="1">her Lumpyhead, but she wasn’t going to let them call Jon a thief. </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If he stole it, we could take it off him,” said Hot Pie. “It’s not his anyhow. I could use </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">me a sword like that.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="406" height="15" font="1">Lommy egged him on. “Go on, take it off him, I dare you.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie kicked his donkey, riding closer. “Hey, Lumpyface, you gimme that sword.” His </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hair was the color of straw, his fat face all sunburnt and peeling. “You don’t know how to use </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="25" height="15" font="1">it.” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Yes I do</i>, Arya could have said. <i>I killed a boy, a fat boy like you, I stabbed him in the </i></text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>belly and he died, and I’ll kill you too if you don’t let me alone.</i> Only she did not dare. Yoren </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">didn’t know about the stableboy, but she was afraid of what he might do if he found out. Arya </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was pretty sure that some of the other men were killers too, the three in the manacles for sure, </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">but the queen wasn’t looking for <i>them</i>, so it wasn’t the same. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Look at him,” brayed Lommy Greenhands. “I bet he’s going to cry now. You want to </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="130" height="15" font="1">cry, Lumpyhead?” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She had cried in her sleep the night before, dreaming of her father. Come morning, she’d </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="598" height="15" font="1">woken red-eyed and dry, and could not have shed another tear if her life had hung on it. </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="339" height="15" font="1">“He’s going to wet his pants,” Hot Pie suggested. </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Leave him be,” said the boy with the shaggy black hair who rode behind them. Lommy </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had named him the Bull, on account of this horned helm he had that he polished all the time </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but never wore. Lommy didn’t dare mock the Bull. He was older, and big for his age, with a </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">broad chest and strong-looking arms. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You better give Hot Pie the sword, Arry,” Lommy said. “Hot Pie wants it bad. He </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="375" height="15" font="1">kicked a boy to death. He’ll do the same to you, I bet.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I knocked him down and I kicked him in the balls, and I kept kicking him there until he </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was dead,” Hot Pie boasted. “I kicked him all to pieces. His balls were broke open and bloody </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="391" height="15" font="1">and his cock turned black. You better gimme the sword.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya slid her practice sword from her belt. “You can have this one,” she told Hot Pie, not </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="117" height="15" font="1">wanting to fight. </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="553" height="15" font="1">“That’s just some stick.” He rode nearer and tried to reach over for Needle’s hilt. </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya made the stick whistle as she laid the wood across his donkey’s hindquarters. The </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">animal <i>hawed</i> and bucked, dumping Hot Pie on the ground. She vaulted off her own donkey </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and poked him in the gut as he tried to get up and he sat back down with a grunt. Then she </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">whacked him across the face and his nose made a <i>crack</i> like a branch breaking. Blood </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">dribbled from his nostrils. When Hot Pie began to wail, Arya whirled toward Lommy </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Greenhands, who was sitting on his donkey openmouthed. “You want some sword too?” she </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">yelled, but he didn’t. He raised dyed green hands in front of his face and squealed at her to get </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">away. </text>
</page>
<page number="19" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The Bull shouted, “Behind you,” and Arya spun. Hot Pie was on his knees, his fist </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">closing around a big jagged rock. She let him throw it, ducking her head as it sailed past. Then </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she flew at him. He raised a hand and she hit it, and then his cheek, and then his knee. He </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grabbed for her, and she danced aside and bounced the wood off the back of his head. He fell </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">down and got up and stumbled after her, his red face all smeared with dirt and blood. Arya </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slid into a water dancer’s stance and waited. When he came close enough, she lunged, right </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">between his legs, so hard that if her wooden sword had had a point it would have come out </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="170" height="15" font="1">between his butt cheeks. </text>
<text top="265" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By the time Yoren pulled her off him, Hot Pie was sprawled out on the ground with his </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">breeches brown and smelly, crying as Arya whapped him over and over and over. “<i>Enough</i>,” </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the black brother roared, prying the stick sword from her fingers, “you want to kill the fool?” </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">When Lommy and some others started to squeal, the old man turned on them too. “Shut your </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mouths, or I’ll be shutting them for you. Any more o’ this, I’ll tie you lot behind the wagons </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and <i>drag</i> you to the Wall.” He spat. “And that goes twice for you, Arry. You come with me, </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">boy. <i>Now</i>.” </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They were all looking at her, even the three chained and manacled in the back of the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">wagon. The fat one snapped his pointy teeth together and hissed, but Arya ignored him. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The old man dragged her well off the road into a tangle of trees, cursing and muttering all </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the while. “If I had a thimble o’ sense, I would’ve left you in King’s Landing. You hear me, </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>boy?</i>” He always snarled that word, putting a bite in it so she would be certain to hear. </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">“Unlace your breeches and pull ‘em down. Go on, there’s no one here to see. Do it.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sullenly, Arya did as he said. “Over there, against the oak. Yes, like that.” She wrapped </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her arms around the trunk and pressed her face to the rough wood. “You scream now. You </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">scream loud.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>I won’t</i>, Arya thought stubbornly, but when Yoren laid the wood against the back of her </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bare thighs, the shriek burst out of her anyway. “Think that hurt?” he said. “Try this one.” The </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">stick came whistling. Arya shrieked again, clutching the tree to keep from falling. “One </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">more.” She held on tight, chewing her lip, flinching when she heard it coming. The stroke </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">made her jump and howl. <i>I won’t cry</i>, she thought, <i>I won’t do that. I’m a Stark of Winterfell, </i></text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>our sigil is the direwolf, direwolves don’t cry.</i> She could feel a thin trickle of blood running </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down her left leg. Her thighs and cheeks were ablaze with pain. “Might be I got your attention </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">now,” Yoren said. “Next time you take that stick to one of your brothers, you’ll get twice </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">what you give, you hear me? Now cover yourself.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>They’re not my brothers</i>, Arya thought as she bent to yank up her breeches, but she knew </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="439" height="15" font="1">better than to say so. Her hands fumbled with her belt and laces. </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="267" height="15" font="1">Yoren was looking at her. “You hurt?” </text>
<text top="850" left="171" width="554" height="15" font="5"><i>Calm as still water</i>, she told herself, the way Syrio Forel had taught her. “Some.” </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He spat. “That pie boy’s hurting worse. It wasn’t him as killed your father, girl, nor that </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="426" height="15" font="1">thieving Lommy neither. Hitting them won’t bring him back.” </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="236" height="15" font="1">“I know,” Arya muttered sullenly. </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Here’s something you don’t know. It wasn’t supposed to happen like it did. I was set to </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">leave, wagons bought and loaded, and a man comes with a boy for me, and a purse of coin, </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and a message, never mind who it’s from. Lord Eddard’s to take the black, he says to me, </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">wait, he’ll be going with you. Why d’you think I was there? Only something went queer.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="369" height="15" font="1">“<i>Joffrey</i>,” Arya breathed. “Someone should kill <i>him!</i>” </text>

<page number="20" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Someone will, but it won’t be me, nor you neither.” Yoren tossed back her stick sword. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Got sourleaf back at the wagons,” he said as they made their way back to the road. “You’ll </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="254" height="15" font="1">chew some, it’ll help with the sting.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It did help, some, though the taste of it was foul and it made her spit look like blood. </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Even so, she walked for the rest of that day, and the day after, and the day after <i>that</i>, too raw </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to sit a donkey. Hot Pie was worse off; Yoren had to shift some barrels around so he could lie </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the back of a wagon on some sacks of barley, and he whimpered every time the wheels hit </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a rock. Lommy Greenhands wasn’t even hurt, yet he stayed as far away from Arya as he could </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">get. “Every time you look at him, he twitches,” the Bull told her as she walked beside his </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">donkey. She did not answer. It seemed safer not to talk to anyone. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">That night she lay upon her thin blanket on the hard ground, staring up at the great red </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">comet. The comet was splendid and scary all at once. “The Red Sword,” the Bull named it; he </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">claimed it looked like a sword, the blade still red-hot from the forge. When Arya squinted the </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">right way she could see the sword too, only it wasn’t a new sword, it was Ice, her father’s </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">greatsword, all ripply Valyrian steel, and the red was Lord Eddard’s blood on the blade after </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Ser Ilyn the King’s Justice had cut off his head. Yoren had made her look away when it </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">happened, yet it seemed to her that the comet looked like Ice must have, after. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">When at last she slept, she dreamed of home. The kingsroad wound its way past </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Winterfell on its way to the Wall, and Yoren had promised he’d leave her there with no one </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">any wiser about who she’d been. She yearned to see her mother again, and Robb and Bran and </text>

<text top="664" left="431" width="60" height="15" font="4"><b>SANSA</b> </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The morning of King Joffrey’s name day dawned bright and windy, with the long tail of </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the great comet visible through the high scuttling clouds. Sansa was watching it from her </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tower window when Ser Arys Oakheart arrived to escort her down to the tourney grounds. </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="319" height="15" font="1">“What do you think it means?” she asked him. </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Glory to your betrothed,” Ser Arys answered at once. “See how it flames across the sky </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">today on His Grace’s name day, as if the gods themselves had raised a banner in his honor. </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="362" height="15" font="1">The smallfolk have named it King Joffrey’s Comet.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Doubtless that was what they told Joffrey; Sansa was not so sure. “I’ve heard servants </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="1">calling it the Dragon’s Tail.” </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“King Joffrey sits where Aegon the Dragon once sat, in the castle built by his son,” Ser </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Arys said. “He is the dragon’s heir—and crimson is the color of House Lannister, another </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sign. This comet is sent to herald Joffrey’s ascent to the throne, I have no doubt. It means that </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">he will triumph over his enemies.” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Is it true?</i> she wondered. <i>Would the gods be so cruel?</i> Her mother was one of Joffrey’s </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">enemies now, her brother Robb another. Her father had died by the king’s command. Must </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Robb and her lady mother die next? The comet was red, but Joffrey was Baratheon as much </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as Lannister, and their sigil was a black stag on a golden field. Shouldn’t the gods have sent </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="146" height="15" font="1">Joff a golden comet? </text>

<page number="21" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sansa closed the shutters and turned sharply away from the window. “You look very </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="263" height="15" font="1">lovely today, my lady,” Ser Arys said. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Thank you, ser.” Knowing that Joffrey would require her to attend the tourney in his </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">honor, Sansa had taken special care with her face and clothes. She wore a gown of pale purple </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silk and a moonstone hair net that had been a gift from Joffrey. The gown had long sleeves to </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hide the bruises on her arms. Those were Joffrey’s gifts as well. When they told him that </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Robb had been proclaimed King in the North, his rage had been a fearsome thing, and he had </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">sent Ser Boros to beat her. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Shall we go?” Ser Arys offered his arm and she let him lead her from her chamber. If </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she must have one of the Kingsguard dogging her steps, Sansa preferred that it be him. Ser </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Boros was short-tempered, Ser Meryn cold, and Ser Mandon’s strange dead eyes made her </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">uneasy, while Ser Preston treated her like a lackwit child. Arys Oakheart was courteous, and </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would talk to her cordially. Once he even objected when Joffrey commanded him to hit her. </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He <i>did</i> hit her in the end, but not hard as Ser Meryn or Ser Boros might have, and at least he </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">had argued. The others obeyed without question . . . except for the Hound, but Joff never </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">asked the Hound to punish her. He used the other five for that. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Arys had light-brown hair and a face that was not unpleasant to look upon. Today he </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">made quite the dashing figure, with his white silk cloak fastened at the shoulder by a golden </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">leaf, and a spreading oak tree worked upon the breast of his tunic in shining gold thread. </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Who do you think will win the day’s honors?” Sansa asked as they descended the steps arm </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">in arm. </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I will,” Ser Arys answered, smiling. “Yet I fear the triumph will have no savor. This </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will be a small field, and poor. No more than two score will enter the lists, including squires </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="425" height="15" font="1">and freeriders. There is small honor in unhorsing green boys.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The last tourney had been different, Sansa reflected. King Robert had staged it in her </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">father’s honor. High lords and fabled champions had come from all over the realm to </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">compete, and the whole city had turned out to watch. She remembered the splendor of it: the </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">field of pavilions along the river with a knight’s shield hung before each door, the long rows </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of silken pennants waving in the wind, the gleam of sunlight on bright steel and gilded spurs. </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The days had rung to the sounds of trumpets and pounding hooves, and the nights had been </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">full of feasts and song. Those had been the most magical days of her life, but they seemed a </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">memory from another age now. Robert Baratheon was dead, and her father as well, beheaded </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for a traitor on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor. Now there were three kings in the land, </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and war raged beyond the Trident while the city filled with desperate men. Small wonder that </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">they had to hold Joff’s tournament behind the thick stone walls of the Red Keep. </text>
<text top="819" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Will the queen attend, do you think?” Sansa always felt safer when Cersei was there to </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="1">restrain her son. </text>
<text top="864" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I fear not, my lady. The council is meeting, some urgent business.” Ser Arys dropped </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his voice. “Lord Tywin has gone to ground at Harrenhal instead of bringing his army to the </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">city as the queen commanded. Her Grace is furious.” He fell silent as a column of Lannister </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">guardsmen marched past, in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms. Ser Arys was fond of </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="431" height="15" font="1">gossip, but only when he was certain that no one was listening. </text>
<text top="967" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The carpenters had erected a gallery and lists in the outer bailey. It was a poor thing </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">indeed, and the meager throng that had gathered to watch filled but half the seats. Most of the </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spectators were guardsmen in the gold cloaks of the City Watch or the crimson of House </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lannister; of lords and ladies there were but a paltry few, the handful that remained at court. </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Grey-faced Lord Gyles Rosby was coughing into a square of pink silk. Lady Tanda was </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">bracketed by her daughters, placid dull Lollys and acid-tongued Falyse. Ebon-skinned </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jalabhar Xho was an exile who had no other refuge, Lady Ermesande a babe seated on her </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wet nurse’s lap. The talk was she would soon be wed to one of the queen’s cousins, so the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">Lannisters might claim her lands. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The king was shaded beneath a crimson canopy, one leg thrown negligently over the </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">carved wooden arm of his chair. Princess Myrcella and Prince Tommen sat behind him. In the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back of the royal box, Sandor Clegane stood at guard, his hands resting on his swordbelt. The </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">white cloak of the Kingsguard was draped over his broad shoulders and fastened with a </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">jeweled brooch, the snowy cloth looking somehow unnatural against his brown rough-spun </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tunic and studded leather jerkin. “Lady Sansa,” the Hound announced curtly when he saw her. </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">His voice was as rough as the sound of a saw on wood. The burn scars on his face and throat </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="347" height="15" font="1">made one side of his mouth twitch when he spoke. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Princess Myrcella nodded a shy greeting at the sound of Sansa’s name, but plump little </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Prince Tommen jumped up eagerly. “Sansa, did you hear? I’m to ride in the tourney today. </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mother said I could.” Tommen was all of eight. He reminded her of her own little brother, </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="1">Bran. They were of an age. Bran was back at Winterfell, a cripple, yet safe. </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa would have given anything to be with him. “I fear for the life of your foeman,” she </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">told Tommen solemnly. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“His foeman will be stuffed with straw,” Joff said as he rose. The king was clad in a </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gilded breastplate with a roaring lion engraved upon its chest, as if he expected the war to </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">engulf them at any moment. He was thirteen today, and tall for his age, with the green eyes </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">and golden hair of the Lannisters. </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="300" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace,” she said, dipping in a curtsy. </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="560" height="15" font="1">Ser Arys bowed. “Pray pardon me, Your Grace. I must equip myself for the lists.” </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Joffrey waved a curt dismissal while he studied Sansa from head to heels. “I’m pleased </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="152" height="15" font="1">you wore my stones.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">So the king had decided to play the gallant today. Sansa was relieved. “I thank you for </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="545" height="15" font="1">them . . . and for your tender words. I pray you a lucky name day, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Sit,” Joff commanded, gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own. “Have you heard? </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">The Beggar King is dead.” </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“Who?” For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Viserys. The last son of Mad King Aerys. He’s been going about the Free Cities since </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">before I was born, calling himself a king. Well, Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. With molten gold.” He laughed. “That’s funny, don’t you think? The dragon was their </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sigil. It’s almost as good as if some wolf killed your traitor brother. Maybe I’ll feed him to </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">wolves after I’ve caught him. Did I tell you, I intend to challenge him to single combat?” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I should like to see that, Your Grace.” <i>More than you know.</i> Sansa kept her tone cool </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and polite, yet even so Joffrey’s eyes narrowed as he tried to decide whether she was mocking </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">him. “Will you enter the lists today?” she asked quickly. </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The king frowned. “My lady mother said it was not fitting, since the tourney is in my </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">honor. Otherwise I would have been champion. Isn’t that so, dog?” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="408" height="15" font="1">The Hound’s mouth twitched. “Against this lot? Why not?” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>He</i> had been the champion in her father’s tourney, Sansa remembered. “Will you joust </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="223" height="15" font="1">today, my lord?” she asked him. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Clegane’s voice was thick with contempt. “Wouldn’t be worth the bother of arming </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">myself. This is a tournament of gnats.” </text>
</page>
<page number="23" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The king laughed. “My dog has a fierce bark. Perhaps I should command him to fight the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">day’s champion. To the death.” Joffrey was fond of making men fight to the death. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You’d be one knight the poorer.” The Hound had never taken a knight’s vows. His </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="319" height="15" font="1">brother was a knight, and he hated his brother. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A blare of trumpets sounded. The king settled back in his seat and took Sansa’s hand. </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Once that would have set her heart to pounding, but that was before he had answered her plea </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">for mercy by presenting her with her father’s head. His touch filled her with revulsion now, </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="454" height="15" font="1">but she knew better than to show it. She made herself sit very still. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ser Meryn Trant of the Kingsguard</i>,” a herald called. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Meryn entered from the west side of the yard, clad in gleaming white plate chased </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with gold and mounted on a milk-white charger with a flowing grey mane. His cloak streamed </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">behind him like a field of snow. He carried a twelve-foot lance. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ser Hobber of House Redwyne, of the Arbor</i>,” the herald sang. Ser Hobber trotted in </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from the east, riding a black stallion caparisoned in burgundy and blue. His lance was striped </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in the same colors, and his shield bore the grape cluster sigil of his House. The Redwyne </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">twins were the queen’s unwilling guests, even as Sansa was. She wondered whose notion it </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="507" height="15" font="1">had been for them to ride in Joffrey’s tourney. Not their own, she thought. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">At a signal from the master of revels, the combatants couched their lances and put their </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spurs to their mounts. There were shouts from the watching guardsmen and the lords and </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ladies in the gallery. The knights came together in the center of the yard with a great shock of </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wood and steel. The white lance and the striped one exploded in splinters within a second of </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">each other. Hobber Redwyne reeled at the impact, yet somehow managed to keep his seat. </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Wheeling their horses about at the far end of the lists, the knights tossed down their broken </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lances and accepted replacements from the squires. Ser Horas Redwyne, Ser Hobber’s twin, </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="263" height="15" font="1">shouted encouragement to his brother. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">But on their second pass Ser Meryn swung the point of his lance to strike Ser Hobber in </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the chest, driving him from the saddle to crash resoundingly to the earth. Ser Horas cursed </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="369" height="15" font="1">and ran out to help his battered brother from the field. </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="272" height="15" font="1">“Poorly ridden,” declared King Joffrey. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ser Balon Swann, of Stonehelm in the Red Watch</i>,” came the herald’s cry. Wide white </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wings ornamented Ser Balon’s greathelm, and black and white swans fought on his shield. </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="405" height="15" font="1">“<i>Morros of House Slynt, heir to Lord Janos of Harrenhal</i>.” </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Look at that up-jumped oaf,” Joff hooted, loud enough for half the yard to hear. Morros, </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a mere squire and a new-made squire at that, was having difficulty managing lance and shield. </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The lance was a knight’s weapon, Sansa knew, the Slynts lowborn. Lord Janos had been no </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">more than commander of the City Watch before Joffrey had raised him to Harrenhal and the </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">council. </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Next came Ser Horas Redwyne’s turn. He fared better than his twin, vanquishing an </text>

<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">field. Splendid as he looked, the old man made a poor contest of it. Joffrey curled his lip. </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The king was growing bored. It made Sansa anxious. She lowered her eyes and resolved </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to keep quiet, no matter what. When Joffrey Baratheon’s mood darkened, any chance word </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">might set off one of his rages. </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The freerider, a small man in dented plate without device, duly appeared at the west end </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the yard, but of his opponent there was no sign. Finally a chestnut stallion trotted into view </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in a swirl of crimson and scarlet silks, but Ser Dontos was not on it. The knight appeared a </text>

<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">His legs were pale and skinny, and his manhood flopped about obscenely as he chased after </text>

<text top="566" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">By then the crowd was howling with laughter . . . all but the king. Joffrey had a look in </text>

<text top="669" left="171" width="472" height="15" font="1">The king stood. “A cask from the cellars! I’ll see him drowned in it.” </text>

<text top="720" left="171" width="310" height="15" font="1">Joffrey turned his head. “What did you say?” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa could not believe she had spoken. Was she mad? To tell him <i>no</i> in front of half the </text>

<text top="834" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Please,” Sansa said, “I only meant . . . it would be ill-luck, Your Grace . . . to, to kill a </text>

<text top="879" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You’re lying,” Joffrey said. “I ought to drown you with him, if you care for him so </text>

<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I don’t care for him, Your Grace.” The words tumbled out desperately. “Drown him or </text>

<text top="1007" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Joffrey scowled. He knew she was lying, she could see it. He would make her bleed for </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Unhappy, Joffrey shifted in his seat and flicked his fingers at Ser Dontos. “Take him </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="355" height="15" font="1">away. I’ll have him killed on the morrow, the fool.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He is,” Sansa said. “A fool. You’re so clever, to see it. He’s better fitted to be a fool </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">than a knight, isn’t he? You ought to dress him in motley and make him clown for you. He </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">doesn’t deserve the mercy of a quick death.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The king studied her a moment. “Perhaps you’re not so stupid as Mother says.” He raised </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his voice. “Did you hear my lady, Dontos? From this day on, you’re my new fool. You can </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="299" height="15" font="1">sleep with Moon Boy and dress in motley.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Dontos, sobered by his near brush with death, crawled to his knees. “Thank you, </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">Your Grace. And you, my lady. Thank you.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As a brace of Lannister guardsmen led him off, the master of revels approached the box. </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace,” he said, “shall I summon a new challenger for Brune, or proceed with the next </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">tilt?” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Neither. These are gnats, not knights. I’d have them all put to death, only it’s my name </text>

<text top="475" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The master of revels bowed, but Prince Tommen was not so obedient. “I’m supposed to </text>

<text top="519" left="171" width="91" height="15" font="1">“Not today.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="145" height="15" font="1">“But I want to ride!” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="205" height="15" font="1">“I don’t care what you want.” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="188" height="15" font="1">“Mother <i>said</i> I could ride.” </text>
<text top="620" left="171" width="260" height="15" font="1">“She said,” Princess Myrcella agreed. </text>
<text top="645" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">“Mother <i>said</i>,” mocked the king. “Don’t be childish.” </text>
<text top="670" left="171" width="553" height="15" font="1">“We’re children,” Myrcella declared haughtily. “We’re <i>supposed</i> to be childish.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="287" height="15" font="1">The Hound laughed. “She has you there.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Joffrey was beaten. “Very well. Even my brother couldn’t tilt any worse than these </text>
<text top="740" left="139" width="464" height="15" font="1">others. Master, bring out the quintain, Tommen wants to be a gnat.” </text>
<text top="765" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tommen gave a shout of joy and ran off to be readied, his chubby little legs pumping </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="1">hard. “Luck,” Sansa called to him. </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They set up the quintain at the far end of the lists while the prince’s pony was being </text>
<text top="829" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">saddled. Tommen’s opponent was a child-sized leather warrior stuffed with straw and </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mounted on a pivot, with a shield in one hand and a padded mace in the other. Someone had </text>
<text top="868" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fastened a pair of antlers to the knight’s head. Joffrey’s father King Robert had worn antlers </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on his helm, Sansa remembered . . . but so did his uncle Lord Renly, Robert’s brother, who </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">had turned traitor and crowned himself king. </text>
<text top="932" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">A pair of squires buckled the prince into his ornate silver-and-crimson armor. A tall </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">plume of red feathers sprouted from the crest of his helm, and the lion of Lannister and </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">crowned stag of Baratheon frolicked together on his shield. The squires helped him mount, </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Ser Aron Santagar, the Red Keep’s master-at-arms, stepped forward and handed Tommen </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">a blunted silver longsword with a leaf-shaped blade, crafted to fit an eight-year-old hand. </text>
<text top="1035" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tommen raised the blade high. “Casterly Rock!” he shouted in a high boyish voice as he </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">put his heels into his pony and started across the hard-packed dirt at the quintain. Lady Tanda </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Lord Gyles started a ragged cheer, and Sansa added her voice to theirs. The king brooded </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">in silence. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tommen got his pony up to a brisk trot, waved his sword vigorously, and struck the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knight’s shield a solid blow as he went by. The quintain spun, the padded mace flying around </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to give the prince a mighty whack in the back of his head. Tommen spilled from the saddle, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his new armor rattling like a bag of old pots as he hit the ground. His sword went flying, his </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">pony cantered away across the bailey, and a great gale of derision went up. King Joffrey </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="1">laughed longest and loudest of all. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">“Oh,” Princess Myrcella cried. She scrambled out of the box and ran to her little brother. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa found herself possessed of a queer giddy courage. “You should go with her,” she </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="301" height="15" font="1">told the king. “Your brother might be hurt.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="237" height="15" font="1">Joffrey shrugged. “What if he is?” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You should help him up and tell him how well he rode.” Sansa could not seem to stop </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">herself. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He got knocked off his horse and fell in the dirt,” the king pointed out. “That’s not </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="90" height="15" font="1">riding well.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="546" height="15" font="1">“Look,” the Hound interrupted. “The boy has courage. He’s going to try again.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They were helping Prince Tommen mount his pony. <i>If only Tommen were the elder </i></text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="5"><i>instead of Joffrey</i>, Sansa thought. <i>I wouldn’t mind marrying Tommen.</i> </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The sounds from the gatehouse took them by surprise. Chains rattled as the portcullis </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was drawn upward, and the great gates opened to the creak of iron hinges. “Who told them to </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">open the gate?” Joff demanded. With the troubles in the city, the gates of the Red Keep had </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">been closed for days. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A column of riders emerged from beneath the portcullis with a clink of steel and a clatter </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of hooves. Clegane stepped close to the king, one hand on the hilt of his longsword. The </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">visitors were dinted and haggard and dusty, yet the standard they carried was the lion of </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">Lannister, golden on its crimson field. A few wore the red cloaks and mail of Lannister men-</text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">at-arms, but more were freeriders and sellswords, armored in oddments and bristling with </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sharp  steel . . . and  there  were  others,  monstrous savages out of one of Old Nan’s tales, the </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">scary ones Bran used to love. They were clad in shabby skins and boiled leather, with long </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hair and fierce beards. Some wore bloodstained bandages over their brows or wrapped around </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">their hands, and others were missing eyes, ears, and fingers. </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In their midst, riding on a tall red horse in a strange high saddle that cradled him back </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and front, was the queen’s dwarf brother Tyrion Lannister, the one they called the Imp. He </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had let his beard grow to cover his pushed-in face, until it was a bristly tangle of yellow and </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">black hair, coarse as wire. Down his back flowed a shadowskin cloak, black fur striped with </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">white. He held the reins in his left hand and carried his right arm in a white silk sling, but </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">otherwise looked as grotesque as Sansa remembered from when he had visited Winterfell. </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">With his bulging brow and mismatched eyes, he was still the ugliest man she had ever </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">chanced to look upon. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yet Tommen put his spurs into his pony and galloped headlong across the yard, shouting </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with glee. One of the savages, a huge shambling man so hairy that his face was all but lost </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beneath his whiskers, scooped the boy out of his saddle, armor and all, and deposited him on </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the ground beside his uncle. Tommen’s breathless laughter echoed off the walls as Tyrion </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">clapped him on the backplate, and Sansa was startled to see that the two were of a height. </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Myrcella came running after her brother, and the dwarf picked her up by the waist and spun </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">her in a circle, squealing. </text>
</page>
<page number="27" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When he lowered her back to the ground, the little man kissed her lightly on the brow </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and came waddling across the yard toward Joffrey. Two of his men followed close behind </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him; a black-haired black-eyed sellsword who moved like a stalking cat, and a gaunt youth </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with an empty socket where one eye should have been. Tommen and Myrcella trailed after </text>

<text top="207" left="171" width="408" height="15" font="1">The dwarf went to one knee before the king. “Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="141" height="15" font="1">“You,” Joffrey said. </text>

<text top="277" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">uncle and an elder.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">“They said you were dead,” the Hound said. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The little man gave the big one a look. One of his eyes was green, one was black, and </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="1">both were cool. “I was speaking to the king, not to his cur.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="353" height="15" font="1">“<i>I’m</i> glad you’re not dead,” said Princess Myrcella. </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We share that view, sweet child.” Tyrion turned to Sansa. “My lady, I am sorry for your </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">losses. Truly, the gods are cruel.” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa could not think of a word to say to him. How could he be sorry for her losses? Was </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">he mocking her? It wasn’t the gods who’d been cruel, it was Joffrey. </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“I am sorry for your loss as well, Joffrey,” the dwarf said. </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="94" height="15" font="1">“What loss?” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your royal father? A large fierce man with a black beard; you’ll recall him if you try. </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">He was king before you.” </text>
<text top="581" left="171" width="346" height="15" font="1">“Oh, <i>him</i>. Yes, it was very sad, a boar killed him.” </text>
<text top="606" left="171" width="265" height="15" font="1">“Is that what ‘they’ say, Your Grace?” </text>
<text top="631" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Joffrey frowned. Sansa felt that she ought to say something. What was it that Septa </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mordane used to tell her? <i>A lady’s armor is courtesy</i>, that was it. She donned her armor and </text>
<text top="670" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">said, “I’m sorry my lady mother took you captive, my lord.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A great many people are sorry for that,” Tyrion replied, “and before I am done, some </text>
<text top="715" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">may be a deal sorrier . . . yet I thank you for the sentiment. Joffrey, where might I find your </text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">mother?” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“She’s with my council,” the king answered. “Your brother Jaime keeps losing battles.” </text>
<text top="779" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He gave Sansa an angry look, as if it were her fault. “He’s been taken by the Starks and we’ve </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">lost Riverrun and now her stupid brother is calling himself a king.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The dwarf smiled crookedly. “All sorts of people are calling themselves kings these </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">days.” </text>
<text top="868" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Joff did not know what to make of that, though he looked suspicious and out of sorts. </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">“Yes. Well. I am pleased you’re not dead, Uncle. Did you bring me a gift for my name day?” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="119" height="15" font="1">“I did. My wits.” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’d sooner have Robb Stark’s head,” Joff said with a sly glance at Sansa. “Tommen, </text>
<text top="957" left="139" width="122" height="15" font="1">Myrcella, come.” </text>
<text top="982" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sandor Clegane lingered behind a moment. “I’d guard that tongue of yours, little man,” </text>
<text top="1002" left="139" width="316" height="15" font="1">he warned, before he strode off after his liege. </text>
<text top="1027" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa was left with the dwarf and his monsters. She tried to think of what else she might </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">say. “You hurt your arm,” she managed at last. </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">face. “Is it grief for your lord father that makes you so sad?” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My father was a traitor,” Sansa said at once. “And my brother and lady mother are </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">traitors as well.” That reflex she had learned quickly. “I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“No doubt. As loyal as a deer surrounded by wolves.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lions,” she whispered, without thinking. She glanced about nervously, but there was no </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">one close enough to hear. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lannister reached out and took her hand, and gave it a squeeze. “I am only a little lion, </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">child, and I vow, I shall not savage you.” Bowing, he said “But now you must excuse me. I </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="319" height="15" font="1">have urgent business with queen and council.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa watched him walk off, his body swaying heavily from side to side with every step, </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like something from a grotesquerie. <i>He speaks more gently than Joffrey</i>, she thought, <i>but the </i></text>

<text top="544" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the chilly white raiment of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon Moore looked like a corpse in </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">a shroud. “Her Grace left orders, the council in session is not to be disturbed.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I would be only a small disturbance, ser.” Tyrion slid the parchment from his sleeve. “I </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">bear a letter from my father, Lord Tywin Lannister, the Hand of the King. There is his seal.” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed,” Ser Mandon repeated slowly, as if Tyrion </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">were a dullard who had not heard him the first time. </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Jaime had once told him that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard—</text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">excepting himself, always—because his face gave no hint as what he might do next. Tyrion </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">would have welcomed a hint. Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if it came to </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swords, but it would scarcely bode well if he began by slaying one of Joffrey’s protectors. Yet </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">if he let the man turn him away, where was his authority? He made himself smile. “Ser </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mandon, you have not met my companions. This is Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Burned Men. And this is Bronn. Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who was captain of </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">Lord Arryn’s household guard?” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="526" height="15" font="1">“I know the man.” Ser Mandon’s eyes were pale grey, oddly flat and lifeless. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">“Knew,” Bronn corrected with a thin smile. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="393" height="15" font="1">Ser Mandon did not deign to show that he had heard that. </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Be that as it may,” Tyrion said lightly, “I truly must see my sister and present my letter, </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="385" height="15" font="1">ser. If you would be so kind as to open the door for us?” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The white knight did not respond. Tyrion was almost at the point of trying to force his </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">way past when Ser Mandon abruptly stood aside. “You may enter. They may not.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>A small victory</i>, he thought, <i>but sweet.</i> He had passed his first test. Tyrion Lannister </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shouldered through the door, feeling almost tall. Five members of the king’s small council </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">broke off their discussion suddenly. “You,” his sister Cersei said in a tone that was equal parts </text>

</page>
<page number="29" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I can see where Joffrey learned his courtesies.” Tyrion paused to admire the pair of </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Valyrian sphinxes that guarded the door, affecting an air of casual confidence. Cersei could </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">smell weakness the way a dog smells fear. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What are you doing here?” His sister’s lovely green eyes studied him without the least </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">hint of affection. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Delivering a letter from our lord father.” He sauntered to the table and placed the tightly </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="223" height="15" font="1">rolled parchment between them. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The eunuch Varys took the letter and turned it in his delicate powdered hands. “How </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kind of Lord Tywin. And his sealing wax is such a lovely shade of gold.” Varys gave the seal </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">a close inspection. “It gives every appearance of being genuine.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Of course it’s genuine.” Cersei snatched it out of his hands. She broke the wax and </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">unrolled the parchment. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion watched her read. His sister had taken the king’s seat for herself—he gathered </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings, no more than Robert had—so Tyrion </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="420" height="15" font="1">climbed up into the Hand’s chair. it seemed only appropriate. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This is absurd,” the queen said at last. “My lord father has sent my brother to sit in his </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">place in this council. He bids us accept Tyrion as the Hand of the King, until such time as he </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">himself can join us.” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Grand Maester Pycelle stroked his flowing white beard and nodded ponderously. “It </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">would seem that a welcome is in order.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Indeed.” Jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gotten rather above himself. “We have sore need of you, my lord. Rebellion everywhere, this </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="354" height="15" font="1">grim omen in the sky, rioting in the city streets . . .” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And whose fault is that, Lord Janos?” Cersei lashed out. “Your gold cloaks are charged </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="592" height="15" font="1">with keeping order. As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle.” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He laughed. “No, I’m done with fields of battle, thank you. I sit a chair better than a </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">horse, and I’d sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe. All that about the thunder of the </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">drums, sunlight flashing on armor, magnificent destriers snorting and prancing? Well, the </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drums gave me headaches, the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest-day </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">goose, and those magnificent destriers shit <i>everywhere</i>. Not that I am complaining. Compared </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and fly bites are my </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="114" height="15" font="1">favorite things.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="491" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger laughed. “Well said, Lannister. A man after my own heart.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Tyrion smiled at him, remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Valyrian steel blade. <i>We must have a talk about that, and soon.</i>  He  wondered  if  Lord  Petyr </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would find that subject amusing as well. “Please,” he told them, “do let me be of service, in </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">whatever <i>small</i> way I can.” </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="512" height="15" font="1">Cersei read the letter again. “How many men have you brought with you?” </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“A few hundred. My own men, chiefly. Father was loath to part with any of his. He <i>is</i> </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">fighting a war, after all.” </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What use will your few hundred men be if Renly marches on the city, or Stannis sails </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from Dragonstone? I ask for an army and my father sends me a dwarf. The <i>king</i> names the </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="452" height="15" font="1">Hand, with the consent of council. Joffrey named our lord father.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="229" height="15" font="1">“And our lord father named me.” </text>
<text top="1057" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">“He cannot do that. Not without Joff’s consent.” </text>
</page>
<page number="30" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lord Tywin is at Harrenhal with his host, if you’d care to take it up with him,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">said politely. “My lords, perchance you would permit me a private word with my sister?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Varys slithered to his feet, smiling in that unctuous way he had. “How you must have </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yearned for the sound of your sweet sister’s voice. My lords, please, let us give them a few </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">moments together. The woes of our troubled realm shall keep.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Janos Slynt rose hesitantly and Grand Maester Pycelle ponderously, yet they rose. </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger was the last. “Shall I tell the steward to prepare chambers in Maegor’s Holdfast?” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“My thanks, Lord Petyr, but I will be taking Lord Stark’s former quarters in the Tower of </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger laughed. “You’re a braver man than me, Lannister. You <i>do</i> know the fate of </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">our last two Hands?” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“Two? If you mean to frighten me, why not say four?” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Four?” Littlefinger raised an eyebrow. “Did the Hands before Lord Arryn meet some </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="520" height="15" font="1">dire end in the Tower? I’m afraid I was too young to pay them much mind.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aerys Targaryen’s last Hand was killed during the Sack of King’s Landing, though I </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">doubt he’d had time to settle into the Tower. He was only Hand for a fortnight. The one </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">before him was burned to death. And before them came two others who died landless and </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">penniless in exile, and counted themselves lucky. I believe my lord father was the last Hand to </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">depart King’s Landing with his name, properties, and parts all intact.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Fascinating,” said Littlefinger. “And all the more reason I’d sooner bed down in the </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">dungeon.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Perhaps you’ll get that wish</i>, Tyrion thought, but he said, “Courage and folly are cousins, </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">or so I’ve heard. Whatever curse may linger over the Tower of the Hand, I pray I’m small </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">enough to escape its notice.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Janos Slynt laughed, Littlefinger smiled, and Grand Maester Pycelle followed them both </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">out, bowing gravely. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I hope Father did not send you all this way to plague us with history lessons,” his sister </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">said when they were alone. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="538" height="15" font="1">“How I have yearned for the sound of your sweet voice,” Tyrion sighed to her. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“How I have yearned to have that eunuch’s tongue pulled out with hot pincers,” Cersei </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">replied. “Has father lost his senses? Or did you forge this letter?” She read it once more, with </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mounting annoyance. “Why would he inflict <i>you</i> on me? I wanted him to come himself.” She </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crushed Lord Tywin’s letter in her fingers. “I am Joffrey’s regent, and I sent him a royal </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="5"><i>command!</i>” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And he ignored you,” Tyrion pointed out. “He has quite a large army, he can do that. </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="179" height="15" font="1">Nor is he the first. Is he?” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s mouth tightened. He could see her color rising. “If I name this letter a forgery </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="552" height="15" font="1">and tell them to throw you in a dungeon, no one will ignore <i>that</i>, I promise you.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He was walking on rotten ice now, Tyrion knew. One false step and he would plunge </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through. “No one,” he agreed amiably, “least of all our father. The one with the army. But </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">why should you want to throw me into a dungeon, sweet sister, when I’ve come all this long </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="128" height="15" font="1">way to help you?” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="519" height="15" font="1">“I do not require <i>your</i> help. It was our father’s presence that I commanded.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="339" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” he said quietly, “but it’s Jaime you want.” </text>

<page number="31" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His sister fancied herself subtle, but he had grown up with her. He could read her face </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">like one of his favorite books, and what he read now was rage, and fear, and despair. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">“Jaime—” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“—is my brother no less than yours,” Tyrion interrupted. “Give me your support and I </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">promise you, we will have Jaime freed and returned to us unharmed.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“How?” Cersei demanded. “The Stark boy and his mother are not like to forget that we </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="170" height="15" font="1">beheaded Lord Eddard.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“True,” Tyrion agreed, “yet you still hold his daughters, don’t you? I saw the older girl </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">out in the yard with Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Sansa,” the queen said. “I’ve given it out that I have the younger brat as well, but it’s a </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lie. I sent Meryn Trant to take her in hand when Robert died, but her wretched dancing master </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">interfered and the girl fled. No one has seen her since. Likely she’s dead. A great many people </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">died that day.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had hoped for both Stark girls, but he supposed one would have to do. “Tell me </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">about our friends on the council.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">His sister glanced at the door. “What of them?” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Father seems to have taken a dislike to them. When I left him, he was wondering how </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their heads might look on the wall beside Lord Stark’s.” He leaned forward across the table. </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="372" height="15" font="1">“Are you certain of their loyalty? Do you trust them?” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I trust no one,” Cersei snapped. “I need them. Does Father believe they are playing us </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">false?” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="131" height="15" font="1">“Suspects, rather.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“Why? What does he know?” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shrugged. “He knows that your son’s short reign has been a long parade of follies </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">and disasters. That suggests that someone is giving Joffrey some very bad counsel.” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei gave him a searching look. “Joff has had no lack of good counsel. He’s always </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">been strong-willed. Now that he’s king, he believes he should do as he pleases, not as he’s </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">bid.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Crowns do queer things to the heads beneath them,” Tyrion agreed. “This business with </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="1">Eddard Stark . . . Joffrey’s work?” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The queen grimaced. “He was instructed to pardon Stark, to allow him to take the black. </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The man would have been out of our way forever, and we might have made peace with that </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">son of his, but Joff took it upon himself to give the mob a better show. What was I to do? He </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">called for Lord Eddard’s head in front of half the city. And Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn went </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ahead blithely and shortened the man without a word from me!” Her hand tightened into a </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fist. “The High Septon claims we profaned Baelor’s Sept with blood, after lying to him about </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">our intent.” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It would seem he has a point,” said Tyrion. “So this <i>Lord</i> Slynt, he was part of it, was </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">he? Tell me, whose fine notion was it to grant him Harrenhal and name him to the council?” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Littlefinger made the arrangements. We needed Slynt’s gold cloaks. Eddard Stark was </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">plotting with Renly and he’d written to Lord Stannis, offering him the throne. We might have </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lost all. Even so, it was a close thing. If Sansa hadn’t come to me and told me all her father’s </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">plans . . .” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tyrion was surprised. “Truly? His own daughter?” Sansa had always seemed such a </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="235" height="15" font="1">sweet child, tender and courteous. </text>
</page>
<page number="32" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The girl was wet with love. She would have done <i>anything</i> for Joffrey, until he cut off </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="425" height="15" font="1">her father’s head and called it mercy. That put an end to that.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“His Grace has a unique way of winning the hearts of his subjects,” Tyrion said with a </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crooked smile. “Was it Joffrey’s wish to dismiss Ser Barristan Selmy from his Kingsguard </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">too?” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei sighed. “Joff wanted someone to blame for Robert’s death. Varys suggested Ser </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Barristan. Why not? It gave Jaime command of the Kingsguard and a seat on the small </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">council, and allowed Joff to throw a bone to his dog. He is very fond of Sandor Clegane. We </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">were prepared to offer Selmy some land and a towerhouse, more than the useless old fool </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">deserved.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I hear that useless old fool slew two of Slynt’s gold cloaks when they tried to seize him </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">at the Mud Gate.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">His sister looked very unhappy. “Janos should have sent more men. He is not as </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">competent as might be wished.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Ser Barristan was the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheon’s Kingsguard,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">reminded her pointedly. “He and Jaime are the only survivors of Aerys Targaryen’s seven. </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The smallfolk talk of him in the same way they talk of Serwyn of the Mirror Shield and </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. What do you imagine they’ll think when they see Barristan </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="397" height="15" font="1">the Bold riding beside Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon?” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="339" height="15" font="1">Cersei glanced away. “I had not considered that.” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Father did,” said Tyrion. “<i>That</i> is why he sent me. To put an end to these follies and </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">bring your son to heel.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“Joff will be no more tractable for you than for me.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="87" height="15" font="1">“He might.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="129" height="15" font="1">“Why should he?” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="271" height="15" font="1">“He knows <i>you</i> would never hurt him.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s eyes narrowed. “If you believe I’d ever allow you to harm my son, you’re sick </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">with fever.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion sighed. She’d missed the point, as she did so often. “Joffrey is as safe with me as </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">he is with you,” he assured her, “but so long as the boy <i>feels</i> threatened, he’ll be more inclined </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to listen.” He took her hand. “I <i>am</i> your brother, you know. You need me, whether you care to </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">admit it or no. Your son needs me, if he’s to have a hope of retaining that ugly iron chair.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="586" height="15" font="1">His sister seemed shocked that he would touch her. “You have always been cunning.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="254" height="15" font="1">“In my own small way.” He grinned. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It may be worth the trying . . . but make no mistake, Tyrion. If I accept you, you shall be </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the King’s Hand in name, but <i>my</i> Hand in truth. You will share all your plans and intentions </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">with me before you act, and you will do <i>nothing</i> without my consent. Do you understand?” </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="75" height="15" font="1">“Oh, yes.” </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="118" height="15" font="1">“Do you agree?” </text>
<text top="971" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Certainly,” he lied. “I am yours, sister.” <i>For as long as I need to be.</i> “So, now that we </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">are of one purpose, we ought have no more secrets between us. You say Joffrey had Lord </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Eddard killed, Varys dismissed Ser Barristan, and Littlefinger gifted us with Lord Slynt. Who </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">murdered Jon Arryn?” </text>
<text top="1054" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">Cersei yanked her hand back. “How should I know?” </text>
</page>
<page number="33" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The grieving widow in the Eyrie seems to think it was me. Where did she come by that </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">notion, I wonder?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m sure I don’t know. That fool Eddard Stark accused me of the same thing. He hinted </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">that Lord Arryn suspected or . . . well, believed . . .” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">“That you were fucking our sweet Jaime?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="120" height="15" font="1">She slapped him. </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Did you think I was as blind as Father?” Tyrion rubbed his cheek. “Who you lie with is </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">no matter to me . . . although it doesn’t seem quite just that you should open your legs for one </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">brother and not the other.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="120" height="15" font="1">She slapped him. </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Be gentle, Cersei, I’m only jesting with you. If truth be told, I’d sooner have a nice </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="558" height="15" font="1">whore. I never understood what Jaime saw in you, apart from his own reflection.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="120" height="15" font="1">She slapped him. </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">His cheeks were red and burning, yet he smiled. “If you keep doing that, I may get </text>
<text top="422" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">angry.” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">That stayed her hand. “Why should I care if you do?” </text>
<text top="472" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have some new friends,” Tyrion confessed. “You won’t like them at all. How did you </text>
<text top="492" left="139" width="92" height="15" font="1">kill Robert?” </text>
<text top="517" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He did that himself. All we did was help. When Lancel saw that Robert was going after </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boar, he gave him strong wine. His favorite sour red, but fortified, three times as potent as he </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was used to. The great stinking fool loved it. He could have stopped swilling it down any time </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he cared to, but no, he drained one skin and told Lancel to fetch another. The boar did the rest. </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">You should have been at the feast, Tyrion. There has never been a boar so delicious. They </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="450" height="15" font="1">cooked it with mushrooms and apples, and it tasted like triumph.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Truly, sister, you were born to be a widow.” Tyrion had rather liked Robert Baratheon, </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">great blustering oaf that he was . . . doubtless in part because his sister loathed him so. “Now, </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">if you are done slapping me, I will be off.” He twisted his legs around and clambered down </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">awkwardly from the chair. </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei frowned. “I haven’t given you leave to depart. I want to know how you intend to </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="86" height="15" font="1">free Jaime.” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll tell you when I know. Schemes are like fruit, they require a certain ripening. Right </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">now, I have a mind to ride through the streets and take the measure of this city.” Tyrion rested </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his hand on the head of the sphinx beside the door. “One parting request. Kindly make certain </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="1">no harm comes to Sansa Stark. It would not do to lose <i>both</i> the daughters.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Outside the council chamber, Tyrion nodded to Ser Mandon and made his way down the </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">long vaulted hall. Bronn fell in beside him. Of Timett son of Timett there was no sign. </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">“Where’s our red hand?” Tyrion asked. </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="535" height="15" font="1">“He felt an urge to explore. His kind was not made for waiting about in halls.” </text>
<text top="940" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I hope he doesn’t kill anyone important.” The clansmen Tyrion had brought down from </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their fastnesses in the Mountains of the Moon were loyal in their own fierce way, but they </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were proud and quarrelsome as well, prone to answer insults real or imagined with steel. “Try </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to find him. And while you are at it, see that the rest have been quartered and fed. I want them </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the barracks beneath the Tower of the Hand, but don’t let the steward put the Stone Crows </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">near the Moon Brothers, and tell him the Burned Men must have a hall all to themselves.” </text>
<text top="1063" left="171" width="152" height="15" font="1">“Where will you be?” </text>
</page>
<page number="34" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="268" height="15" font="1">“I’m riding back to the Broken Anvil.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="560" height="15" font="1">Bronn grinned insolently. “Need an escort? The talk is, the streets are dangerous.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll call upon the captain of my sister’s household guard, and remind him that I am no </text>

<text top="218" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">An hour later, Tyrion rode from the Red Keep accompanied by a dozen Lannister </text>

<text top="257" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">portcullis, he noted the heads mounted atop the walls. Black with rot and old tar, they had </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">long since become unrecognizable. “Captain Vylarr,” he called, “I want those taken down on </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the morrow. Give them to the silent sisters for cleaning.” It would be hell to match them with </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the bodies, he supposed, yet it must be done. Even in the midst of war certain decencies </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">needed to be observed. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Vylarr grew hesitant. “His Grace has told us he wishes the traitors’ heads to remain on </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">the walls until he fills those last three empty spikes there on the end.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Let me hazard a wild stab. One is for Robb Stark, the others for Lords Stannis and </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="1">Renly. Would that be right?” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="112" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lord.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My nephew is thirteen years old today, Vylarr. Try and recall that. I’ll have the heads </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down on the morrow, or one of those empty spikes may have a different lodger. Do you take </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">my meaning, Captain?” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“I’ll see that they’re taken down myself, my lord.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Good.” Tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted away, leaving the red cloaks to </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">follow as best they could. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He had told Cersei he intended to take the measure of the city. That was not entirely a lie. </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tyrion Lannister was not pleased by much of what he saw. The streets of King’s Landing had </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">always been teeming and raucous and noisy, but now they reeked of danger in a way that he </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">did not recall from past visits. A naked corpse sprawled in the gutter near the Street of Looms, </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">being torn at by a pack of feral dogs, yet no one seemed to care. Watchmen were much in </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">evidence, moving in pairs through the alleys in their gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail, </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">iron cudgels never far from their hands. The markets were crowded with ragged men selling </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">their household goods for any price they could get . . . and conspicuously empty of farmers </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">selling food. What little produce he did see was three times as costly as it had been a year ago. </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">One peddler was hawking rats roasted on a skewer. “<i>Fresh rats</i>,” he cried loudly, “<i>fresh rats</i>.” </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Doubtless fresh rats were to be preferred to old stale rotten rats. The frightening thing was, the </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rats looked more appetizing than most of what the butchers were selling. On the Street of </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Flour, Tyrion saw guards at every other shop door. When times grew lean, even bakers found </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="300" height="15" font="1">sellswords cheaper than bread, he reflected. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="1">“There is no food coming in, is there?” he said to Vylarr. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Little enough,” the captain admitted. “With the war in the riverlands and Lord Renly </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">raising rebels in Highgarden, the roads are closed to south and west.” </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">“And what has my good sister done about this?” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“She is taking steps to restore the king’s peace,” Vylarr assured him. “Lord Slynt has </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tripled the size of the City Watch, and the queen has put a thousand craftsmen to work on our </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">defenses. The stonemasons are strengthening the walls, carpenters are building scorpions and </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">catapults by the hundred, fletchers are making arrows, the smiths are forging blades, and the </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="420" height="15" font="1">Alchemists’ Guild has pledged ten thousand jars of wildfire.” </text>
</page>
<page number="35" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. He was pleased that Cersei had not been idle, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">but wildfire was treacherous stuff, and ten thousand jars were enough to turn all of King’s </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Landing into cinders. “Where has my sister found the coin to pay for all of this?” It was no </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">secret that King Robert had left the crown vastly in debt, and alchemists were seldom </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="152" height="15" font="1">mistaken for altruists. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Lord Littlefinger always finds a way, my lord. He has imposed a tax on those wishing to </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">enter the city.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Yes, that would work,” Tyrion said, thinking, <i>Clever. Clever and cruel.</i> Tens of </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thousands had fled the fighting for the supposed safety of King’s Landing. He had seen them </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on the kingsroad, troupes of mothers and children and anxious fathers who had gazed on his </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horses and wagons with covetous eyes. Once they reached the city they would doubtless pay </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">over all they had to put those high comforting walls between them and the war . . . though </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="375" height="15" font="1">they might think twice if they knew about the wildfire. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The inn beneath the sign of the broken anvil stood within sight of those walls, near the </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Gate of the Gods where they had entered that morning. As they rode into its courtyard, a boy </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ran out to help Tyrion down from his horse. “Take your men back to the castle,” he told </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="280" height="15" font="1">Vylarr. “I’ll be spending the night here.” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="396" height="15" font="1">The captain looked dubious. “Will you be safe, my lord?” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, as to that, Captain, when I left the inn this morning it was full of Black Ears. One </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">is never quite safe when Chella daughter of Cheyk is about.” Tyrion waddled toward the door, </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="276" height="15" font="1">leaving Vylarr to puzzle at his meaning. </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">A gust of merriment greeted him as he shoved into the inn’s common room. He </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">recognized Chella’s throaty chuckle and the lighter music of Shae’s laughter. The girl was </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seated by the hearth, sipping wine at a round wooden table with three of the Black Ears he’d </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="652" height="15" font="1">left to guard her and a plump man whose back was to him. The innkeeper, he </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">assumed . . . until Shae called Tyrion by name and the intruder rose. “My good lord, I am so </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="517" height="15" font="1">pleased to see you,” he gushed, a soft eunuch’s smile on his powdered face. </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion stumbled. “Lord Varys. I had not thought to see you here.” <i>The Others take him, </i></text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="5"><i>how did he find them so quickly?</i> </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Forgive me if I intrude,” Varys said. “I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">lady.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Young lady,” Shae repeated, savoring the words. “You’re half right, m’lord. I’m </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">young.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>Eighteen</i>, Tyrion thought. <i>Eighteen, and a whore, but quick of wit, nimble as a cat </i></text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>between the sheets, with large dark eyes and fine black hair and a sweet, soft, hungry little </i></text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>mouth</i> . . . <i>and mine! Damn you, eunuch.</i> “I fear I’m the intruder, Lord Varys,” he said with </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">forced courtesy. “When I came in, you were in the midst of some merriment.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“M’lord Varys complimented Chella on her ears and said she must have killed many men </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">to have such a fine necklace,” Shae explained. It grated on him to hear her call Varys <i>m’lord</i> </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in that tone; that was what she called him in their pillow play. “And Chella told him only </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">cowards kill the vanquished.” </text>
<text top="970" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Braver to leave the man alive, with a chance to cleanse his shame by winning back his </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ear,” explained Chella, a small dark woman whose grisly neckware was hung with no less </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">than forty-six dried, wrinkled ears. Tyrion had counted them once. “Only so can you prove </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">you do not fear your enemies.” </text>
</page>
<page number="36" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Shae hooted. “And then m’lord says if he was a Black Ear he’d never sleep, for dreams </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">of one-eared men.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A problem I will never need face,” Tyrion said. “I’m terrified of my enemies, so I kill </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="71" height="15" font="1">them all.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="415" height="15" font="1">Varys giggled. “Will you take some wine with us, my lord?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I’ll take some wine.” Tyrion seated himself beside Shae. He understood what was </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">happening here, if Chella and the girl did not. Varys was delivering a message. When he said, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>I was taken by a sudden urge to meet your young lady</i>, what he meant was, <i>You tried to hide </i></text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>her, but I knew where she was, and who she was, and here I am.</i> He wondered who had </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="641" height="15" font="1">betrayed him. The innkeeper, that boy in the stable, a guard on the gate . . . or one of his own? </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I always like to return to the city through the Gate of the Gods,” Varys told Shae as he </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">filled the wine cups. “The carvings on the gatehouse are exquisite, they make me weep each </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">time I see them. The eyes . . . so expressive, don’t you think? They almost seem to follow you </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">as you ride beneath the portcullis.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="604" height="15" font="1">“I never noticed, m’lord,” Shae replied. “I’ll look again on the morrow, if it please you.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Don’t bother, sweetling</i>, Tyrion thought, swirling the wine in the cup. <i>He cares not a </i></text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>whit about carvings. The eyes he boasts of are his own. What he means is that he was </i></text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="538" height="15" font="5"><i>watching, that he knew we were here the moment we passed through the gate</i>s<i>.</i> </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Do be careful, child,” Varys urged. “King’s Landing is not wholly safe these days. I </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">know these streets well, and yet I almost feared to come today, alone and unarmed as I was. </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Lawless men are everywhere in this dark time, oh, yes. Men with cold steel and colder </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hearts.” <i>Where I can come alone and unarmed, others can come with swords in their fists</i>, he </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">was saying. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Shae only laughed. “If they try and bother me, they’ll be one ear short when Chella runs </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">them off.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Varys hooted as if that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but there was no </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">laughter in his eyes when he turned them on Tyrion. “Your young lady has an amiable way to </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">her. I should take very good care of her if I were you.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I intend to. Any man who tries to harm her—well, I’m too small to be a Black Ear, and I </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">make no claims to courage.” <i>See? I speak the same tongue you do, eunuch. Hurt her, and I’ll </i></text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="5"><i>have your head.</i> </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I will leave you.” Varys rose. “I know how weary you must be. I only wished to </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">welcome you, my lord, and tell you how very pleased I am by your arrival. We have dire need </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">of you on the council. Have you seen the comet?” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m short, not blind,” Tyrion said. Out on the kingsroad, it had seemed to cover half the </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">sky, outshining the crescent moon. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“In the streets, they call it the Red Messenger,” Varys said. “They say it comes as a </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">herald before a king, to warn of fire and blood to follow.” The eunuch rubbed his powdered </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hands together. “May I leave you with a bit of a riddle, Lord Tyrion?” He did not wait for an </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">answer. “In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it’ says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it’ </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do it’ says the rich man, ‘and </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">all this gold shall be yours.’ So tell me—who lives and who dies?” Bowing deeply, the </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">eunuch hurried from the common room on soft slippered feet. </text>
</page>
<page number="37" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When he was gone, Chella gave a snort and Shae wrinkled up her pretty face. “The rich </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">man lives. Doesn’t he?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tyrion sipped at his wine, thoughtful. “Perhaps. Or not. That would depend on the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="470" height="15" font="1">sellsword, it seems.” He set down his cup. “Come, let’s go upstairs.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She had to wait for him at the top of the steps, for her legs were slim and supple while his </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were short and stunted and full of aches. But she was smiling when he reached her. “Did you </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">miss me?” she teased as she took his hand. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Desperately,” Tyrion admitted. Shae only stood a shade over five feet, yet still he must </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">look up to her . . . but in her case he found he did not mind. She was sweet to look up at. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You’ll miss me all the time in your Red Keep,” she said as she led him to her room. </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">“All alone in your cold bed in your Tower of the Hand.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Too true.” Tyrion would gladly have kept her with him, but his lord father had </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forbidden it. <i>You will not take the whore to court</i>, Lord Tywin had commanded. Bringing her </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to the city was as much defiance as he dared. All his authority derived from his father, the girl </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had to understand that. “You won’t be far,” he promised. “You’ll have a house, with guards </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">and servants, and I’ll visit as often as I’m able.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Shae kicked shut the door. Through the cloudy panes of the narrow window, he could </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">make out the Great Sept of Baelor crowning Visenya’s Hill but Tyrion was distracted by a </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">different sight. Bending, Shae took her gown by the hem, drew it over her head, and tossed it </text>

<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">before him, pink and nude and lovely, one hand braced on her hip. “You’ll think of me every </text>

<text top="611" left="171" width="276" height="15" font="1">“Be quiet and kiss me,” he commanded. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He could taste the wine on her lips, and feel her small firm breasts pressed against him as </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her fingers moved to the lacings of his breeches. “My lion,” she whispered when he broke off </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the kiss to undress. “My sweet lord, my giant of Lannister.” Tyrion pushed her toward the </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bed. When he entered her, she screamed loud enough to wake Baelor the Blessed in his tomb, </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">and her nails left gouges in his back. He’d never had a pain he liked half so well. </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Fool</i>, he thought to himself afterward, as they lay in the center of the sagging mattress </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">amidst the rumpled sheets. <i>Will you never learn, dwarf? She’s a whore, damn you, it’s your </i></text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>coin she loves, not your cock. Remember Tysha?</i> Yet when his fingers trailed lightly over one </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nipple, it stiffened at the touch, and he could see the mark on her breast where he’d bitten her </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="101" height="15" font="1">in his passion. </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“So what will you do, m’lord, now that you’re the Hand of the King?” Shae asked him as </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">he cupped that warm sweet flesh. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Something Cersei will never expect,” Tyrion murmured softly against her slender neck. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He could not walk, nor climb nor hunt nor fight with a wooden sword as once he had, but </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">he could still <i>look</i>. He liked to watch the windows begin to glow all over Winterfell as candles </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and hearth fires were lit behind the diamond-shaped panes of tower and hall, and he loved to </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="276" height="15" font="1">listen to the direwolves sing to the stars. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Of late, he often dreamed of wolves. <i>They are talking to me, brother to brother</i>, he told </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">himself when the direwolves howled. He could almost understand them . . . not quite, not </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">truly, but <i>almost</i> . . . as if they were singing in a language he had once known and somehow </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forgotten. The Walders might be scared of them, but the Starks had wolf blood. Old Nan told </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="458" height="15" font="1">him so. “Though it is stronger in some than in others,” she warned. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Summer’s howls were long and sad, full of grief and longing. Shaggydog’s were more </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">savage. Their voices echoed through the yards and halls until the castle rang and it seemed as </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though some great pack of direwolves haunted Winterfell, instead of only two . . . two where </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">there had once been six. <i>Do they miss their brothers and sisters too?</i> Bran wondered. <i>Are they </i></text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>calling to Grey Wind and Ghost, to Nymeria and Lady’s Shade? Do they want them to come </i></text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="5"><i>home and be a pack together?</i> </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Who can know the mind of a wolf?” Ser Rodrik Cassel said when Bran asked him why </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they howled. Bran’s lady mother had named him castellan of Winterfell in her absence, and </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">his duties left him little time for idle questions. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It’s freedom they’re calling for,” declared Farlen, who was kennelmaster and had no </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">more love for the direwolves than his hounds did. “They don’t like being walled up, and </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="479" height="15" font="1">who’s to blame them? Wild things belong in the wild, not in a castle.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They want to hunt,” agreed Gage the cook as he tossed cubes of suet in a great kettle of </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="586" height="15" font="1">stew. “A wolf smells better’n any man. Like as not, they’ve caught the scent o’ prey.” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin did not think so. “Wolves often howl at the moon. These are howling at </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="1">the comet. See how bright it is, Bran? Perchance they think it <i>is</i> the moon.” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When Bran repeated that to Osha, she laughed aloud. “Your wolves have more wit than </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">your maester,” the wildling woman said. “They know truths the grey man has forgotten.” The </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">way she said it made him shiver, and when he asked what the comet meant, she answered, </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="287" height="15" font="1">“Blood and fire, boy, and nothing sweet.” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran asked Septon Chayle about the comet while they were sorting through some scrolls </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">snatched from the library fire. “It is the sword that slays the season,” he replied, and soon </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">after the white raven came from Oldtown bringing word of autumn, so doubtless he was right. </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Though Old Nan did not think so, and she’d lived longer than any of them. “Dragons,” </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she said, lifting her head and sniffing. She was near blind and could not see the comet, yet she </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">claimed she could <i>smell</i> it. “It be dragons, boy,” she insisted. Bran got no <i>princes</i> from Nan, </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="180" height="15" font="1">no more than he ever had. </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">Hodor said only, “Hodor.” That was all he ever said. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And still the direwolves howled. The guards on the walls muttered curses, hounds in the </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kennels barked furiously, horses kicked at their stalls, the Walders shivered by their fire, and </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">even Maester Luwin complained of sleepless nights. Only Bran did not mind. Ser Rodrik had </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">confined the wolves to the godswood after Shaggydog bit Little Walder, but the stones of </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Winterfell played queer tricks with sound, and sometimes it sounded as if they were in the </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">yard right below Bran’s window. Other times he would have sworn they were up on the </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">curtain walls, loping round like sentries. He wished that he could see them. </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He <i>could</i> see the comet hanging above the Guards Hall and the Bell Tower, and farther </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back the First Keep, squat and round, its gargoyles black shapes against the bruised purple </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dusk. Once Bran had known every stone of those buildings, inside and out; he had climbed </text>

<page number="39" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them all, scampering up walls as easily as other boys ran down stairs. Their rooftops had been </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">his secret places, and the crows atop the broken tower his special friends. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="163" height="15" font="1">And then he had fallen. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran did not remember falling, yet they said he had, so he supposed it must be true. He </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had almost died. When he saw the weatherworn gargoyles atop the First Keep where it had </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">happened, he got a queer tight feeling in his belly. And now he could not climb, nor walk nor </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="1">run nor sword-fight, and the dreams he’d dreamed of knighthood had soured in his head. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Summer had howled the day Bran had fallen, and for long after as he lay broken in his </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bed; Robb had told him so before he went away to war. Summer had mourned for him, and </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Shaggydog and Grey Wind had joined in his grief. And the night the bloody raven had </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">brought word of their father’s death, the wolves had known that too. Bran had been in the </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">maester’s turret with Rickon talking of the children of the forest when Summer and </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">Shaggydog had drowned out Luwin with their howls. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Who are they mourning now?</i> Had some enemy slain the King in the North, who used to </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">be his brother Robb? Had his bastard brother Jon Snow fallen from the Wall? Had his mother </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">died, or one of his sisters? Or was this something else, as maester and septon and Old Nan </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">seemed to think? </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>If I were truly a direwolf, I would understand the song</i>, he thought wistfully. In his wolf </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dreams, he could race up the sides of mountains, jagged icy mountains taller than any tower, </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and stand at the summit beneath the full moon with all the world below him, the way it used </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">to be. </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Oooo,” Bran cried tentatively. He cupped his hands around his mouth and lifted his </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">head to the comet. “<i>Ooooooooooooooooooo, ahooooooooooooooo</i>,” he howled. It sounded </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stupid, high and hollow and quavering, a little boy’s howl, not a wolf’s. Yet Summer gave </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">answer, his deep voice drowning out Bran’s thin one, and Shaggydog made it a chorus. Bran </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="393" height="15" font="5"><i>haroooed</i> again. They howled together, last of their pack. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The noise brought a guard to his door, Hayhead with the wen on his nose. He peered in, </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">saw Bran howling out the window, and said, “What’s this, my prince?” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It made Bran feel queer when they called him prince, though he <i>was</i> Robb’s heir, and </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">Robb was King in the North now. He turned his head to howl at the guard. “<i>Oooooooo. Oo-</i></text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="5"><i>oo-oooooooooooo</i>.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">Hayhead screwed up his face. “Now you stop that there.” </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ooo-ooo-Oooooo. Ooo-Ooo-Ooooooooooooooooo</i>.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The guardsman retreated. When he came back, Maester Luwin was with him, all in grey, </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his chain tight about his neck. “Bran, those beasts make sufficient noise without your help.” </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He crossed the room and put his hand on the boy’s brow. “The hour grows late, you ought to </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">be fast asleep.” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“I’m talking to the wolves.” Bran brushed the hand away. </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“Shall I have Hayhead carry you to your bed?” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I can get to bed myself.” Mikken had hammered a row of iron bars into the wall, so </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Bran could pull himself about the room with his arms. It was slow and hard and it made his </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">shoulders ache, but he hated being carried. “Anyway, I don’t have to sleep if I don’t want to.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“All men must sleep, Bran. Even princes.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When I sleep I turn into a wolf.” Bran turned his face away and looked back out into the </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">night. “Do wolves dream?” </text>
</page>
<page number="40" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="338" height="15" font="1">“All creatures dream, I think, yet not as men do.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Do dead men dream?” Bran asked, thinking of his father. In the dark crypts below </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="507" height="15" font="1">Winterfell, a stonemason was chiseling out his father’s likeness in granite. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Some say yes, some no,” the maester answered. “The dead themselves are silent on the </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">matter.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="130" height="15" font="1">“Do trees dream?” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="115" height="15" font="1">“Trees? No . . .” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They do,” Bran said with sudden certainty. “They dream tree dreams. I dream of a tree </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sometimes. A weirwood, like the one in the godswood. It calls to me. The wolf dreams are </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="405" height="15" font="1">better. I smell things, and sometimes I can taste the blood.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin tugged at his chain where it chafed his neck. “If you would only spend </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">more time with the other children—” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I hate the other children,” Bran said, meaning the Walders. “I commanded you to send </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="90" height="15" font="1">them away.” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Luwin grew stern. “The Freys are your lady mother’s wards, sent here to be fostered at </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her express command. It is not for you to expel them, nor is it kind. If we turned them out, </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">where would they go?” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="384" height="15" font="1">“Home. It’s their fault you won’t let me have Summer.” </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="558" height="15" font="1">“The Frey boy did not ask to be attacked,” the maester said, “no more than I did.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That was Shaggydog.” Rickon’s big black wolf was so wild he even frightened Bran at </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="243" height="15" font="1">times. “Summer never bit anyone.” </text>
<text top="581" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Summer ripped out a man’s throat in this very chamber, or have you forgotten? The </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">truth is, those sweet pups you and your brothers found in the snow have grown into dangerous </text>
<text top="620" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">beasts. The Frey boys are wise to be wary of them.” </text>
<text top="645" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We should put the Walders in the godswood. They could play lord of the crossing all </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they want, and Summer could sleep with me again. If I’m the prince, why won’t you heed </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">me? I wanted to ride Dancer, but Alebelly wouldn’t let me past the gate.” </text>
<text top="709" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And rightly so. The wolfswood is full of danger; your last ride should have taught you </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="592" height="15" font="1">that. Would you want some outlaw to take you captive and sell you to the Lannisters?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Summer would save me,” Bran insisted stubbornly. “Princes should be allowed to sail </text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="428" height="15" font="1">the sea and hunt boar in the wolfswood and joust with lances.” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Bran, child, why do you torment yourself so? One day you may do some of these things, </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">but now you are only a boy of eight.” </text>
<text top="843" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’d sooner be a wolf. Then I could live in the wood and sleep when I wanted, and I </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Walders had arrived from the Twins, it had been Rickon who wanted them gone. A baby </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of four, he had screamed that he wanted Mother and Father and Robb, not these strangers. It </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had been up to Bran to soothe him and bid the Freys welcome. He had offered them meat and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">mead and a seat by the fire, and even Maester Luwin had said afterward that he’d done well. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="216" height="15" font="1">Only that was before the game. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The game was played with a log, a staff, a body of water, and a great deal of shouting. </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The water was the most important, Walder and Walder assured Bran. You could use a plank </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">or even a series of stones, and a branch could be your staff. You didn’t <i>have</i> to shout. But </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">without water, there was no game. As Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik were not about to let the </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">children go wandering off into the wolfswood in search of a stream, they made do with one of </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the murky pools in the godswood. Walder and Walder had never seen hot water bubbling </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="601" height="15" font="1">from the ground before, but they both allowed how it would make the game even better. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Both of them were called Walder Frey. Big Walder said there were bunches of Walders </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">at the Twins, all named after the boys’ grandfather, Lord Walder Frey. “We have our <i>own</i> </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">names at Winterfell,” Rickon told them haughtily when he heard that. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The way their game was played, you laid the log across the water, and one player stood </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in the middle with the stick. He was the lord of the crossing, and when one of the other </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">players came up, he had to say, “I am the lord of the crossing, who goes there?” And the other </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">player had to make up a speech about who they were and why they should be allowed to </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cross. The lord could make them swear oaths and answer questions. They didn’t have to tell </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the truth, but the oaths were binding unless they said “Mayhaps,” so the trick was to say </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Mayhaps” so the lord of the crossing didn’t notice. Then you could try and knock the lord </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">into the water and <i>you</i> got to be lord of the crossing, but only if you’d said “Mayhaps.” </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Otherwise you were out of the game. The lord got to knock anyone in the water any time he </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="382" height="15" font="1">pleased, and he was the only one who got to use a stick. </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In practice, the game seemed to come down to mostly shoving, hitting, and falling into </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">the water, along with a lot of loud arguments about whether or not someone had said </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="488" height="15" font="1">“Mayhaps.” Little Walder was lord of the crossing more often than not. </text>
<text top="683" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He was Little Walder even though he was tall and stout, with a red face and a big round </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">belly. Big Walder was sharp-faced and skinny and half a foot shorter. “He’s fifty-two days </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="583" height="15" font="1">older than me,” Little Walder explained, “so he was bigger at first, but I grew faster.” </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“We’re cousins, not brothers,” added Big Walder, the little one. “I’m Walder son of </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jammos. My father was Lord Walder’s son by his fourth wife. He’s Walder son of Merrett. </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">His grandmother was Lord Walder’s third wife, the Crakehall. He’s ahead of me in the line of </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">succession even though I’m older.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Only by fifty-two days,” Little Walder objected. “And neither of us will ever hold the </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">Twins, stupid.” </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I will,” Big Walder declared. “We’re not the only Walders either. Ser Stevron has a </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">grandson, Black Walder, he’s fourth in line of succession, and there’s Red Walder, Ser </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Emmon’s son, and Bastard Walder, who isn’t in the line at all. He’s called Walder Rivers not </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="321" height="15" font="1">Walder Frey. Plus there’s girls named Walda.” </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“And Tyr. You always forget Tyr.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He’s Wal<i>tyr</i>, not Walder,” Big Walder said airily. “And he’s after us, so he doesn’t </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="251" height="15" font="1">matter. Anyhow, I never liked him.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik decreed that they would share Jon Snow’s old bedchamber, since Jon was in </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Night’s Watch and never coming back. Bran hated that; it made him feel as if the Freys </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">were trying to steal Jon’s place. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He had watched wistfully while the Walders contested with Turnip the cook’s boy and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Joseth’s girls Bandy and Shyra. The Walders had decreed that Bran should be the judge and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">decide whether or not people had said “Mayhaps,” but as soon as they started playing they </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">forgot all about him. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The shouts and splashes soon drew others: Palla the kennel girl, Cayn’s boy Calon, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">TomToo whose father Fat Tom had died with Bran’s father at King’s Landing. Before very </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">long, every one of them was soaked and muddy. Palla was brown from head to heel, with </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">moss in her hair, breathless from laughter. Bran had not heard so much laughing since the </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">night the bloody raven came. <i>If I had my legs, I’d knock all of them into the water</i>, he thought </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">bitterly. <i>No one would ever be lord of the crossing but me.</i> </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Finally Rickon came running into the godswood, Shaggydog at his heels. He watched </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Turnip and Little Walder struggle for the stick until Turnip lost his footing and went in with a </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">huge splash, arms waving. Rickon yelled, “Me! Me now! I want to play!” Little Walder </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beckoned him on, and Shaggydog started to follow. “No, Shaggy,” his brother commanded. </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="392" height="15" font="1">“Wolves can’t play. You stay with Bran.” And he did . . . </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">. . . until Little Walder had smacked Rickon with the stick, square across his belly. Before </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bran could blink, the black wolf was flying over the plank, there was blood in the water, the </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Walders were shrieking red murder, Rickon sat in the mud laughing, and Hodor came </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">lumbering in shouting “Hodor! Hodor! Hodor!” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">After that, oddly, Rickon decided he <i>liked</i> the Walders. They never played lord of the </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">crossing again, but they played other games—monsters and maidens, rats and cats, come-into-</text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">my-castle, all sorts of things. With Rickon by their side, the Walders plundered the kitchens </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for pies and honeycombs, raced round the walls, tossed bones to the pups in the kennels, and </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">trained with wooden swords under Ser Rodrik’s sharp eye. Rickon even showed them the </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">deep vaults under the earth where the stonemason was carving father’s tomb. “You had no </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">right!” Bran screamed at his brother when he heard. “That was our place, a <i>Stark</i> place!” But </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">Rickon never cared. </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The door to his bedchamber opened. Maester Luwin was carrying a green jar, and this </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">time Osha and Hayhead came with him. “I’ve made you a sleeping draught, Bran.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Osha scooped him up in her bony arms. She was very tall for a woman, and wiry strong. </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="249" height="15" font="1">She bore him effortlessly to his bed. </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This will give you dreamless sleep,” Maester Luwin said as he pulled the stopper from </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">the jar. “Sweet, dreamless sleep.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="274" height="15" font="1">“It will?” Bran said, wanting to believe. </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="98" height="15" font="1">“Yes. Drink.” </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran drank. The potion was thick and chalky, but there was honey in it so it went down </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="39" height="15" font="1">easy. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Come the morn, you’ll feel better.” Luwin gave Bran a smile and a pat as he took his </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">leave. </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">Osha lingered behind. “Is it the wolf dreams again?” </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="95" height="15" font="1">Bran nodded. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You should not fight so hard, boy. I see you talking to the heart tree. Might be the gods </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">are trying to talk back.” </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“The gods?” he murmured, drowsy already. Osha’s face grew blurry and grey. <i>Sweet, </i></text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Yet when the darkness closed over him, he found himself in the godswood, moving </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">silently beneath green-grey sentinels and gnarled oaks as old as time. <i>I am walking</i>, he </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thought, exulting. Part of him knew that it was only a dream, but even the dream of walking </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="489" height="15" font="1">was better than the truth of his bedchamber, walls and ceiling and door. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was dark amongst the trees, but the comet lit his way, and his feet were sure. He was </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">moving on four good legs, strong and swift, and he could feel the ground underfoot, the soft </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crackling of fallen leaves, thick roots and hard stones, the deep layers of humus. It was a good </text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The smells filled his head, alive and intoxicating; the green muddy stink of the hot pools, </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the perfume of rich rotting earth beneath his paws, the squirrels in the oaks. The scent of </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">squirrel made him remember the taste of hot blood and the way the bones would crack </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">between his teeth. Slaver filled his mouth. He had eaten no more than half a day past, but </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">there was no joy in dead meat, even deer. He could hear the squirrels chittering and rustling </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">above him, safe among their leaves, but they knew better than to come down to where his </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="1">brother and he were prowling. </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He could smell his brother too, a familiar scent, strong and earthy, his scent as black as </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his coat. His brother was loping around the walls, full of fury. Round and round he went, </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">night after day after night, tireless, searching . . . for prey, for a way out, for his mother, his </text>

<text top="497" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Behind the trees the walls rose, piles of dead man-rock that loomed all about this speck </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of living wood. Speckled grey they rose, and moss-spotted, yet thick and strong and higher </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">than any wolf could hope to leap. Cold iron and splintery wood closed off the only holes </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through the piled stones that hemmed them in. His brother would stop at every hole and bare </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="309" height="15" font="1">his fangs in rage, but the ways stayed closed. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He had done the same the first night, and learned that it was no good. Snarls would open </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">no paths here. Circling the walls would not push them back. Lifting a leg and marking the </text>

<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fingered their weapons and gave lingering looks at the wagons as they rolled by, yet in the </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One day a madwoman began to scream at them from the side of the road. “Fools! They’ll </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="1">kill you, fools!” She was scarecrow-thin, with hollow eyes and bloody feet. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The next morning, a sleek merchant on a grey mare reined up by Yoren and offered to </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">buy his wagons and everything in them for a quarter of their worth. “It’s war, they’ll take </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">what they want, you’ll do better selling to me, my friend.” Yoren turned away with a twist of </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">his crooked shoulders, and spat. </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya noticed the first grave that same day; a small mound beside the road, dug for a </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">child. A crystal had been set in the soft earth, and Lommy wanted to take it until the Bull told </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">him he’d better leave the dead alone. A few leagues farther on, Praed pointed out more </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">graves, a whole row freshly dug. After that, a day hardly passed without one. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">One time Arya woke in the dark, frightened for no reason she could name. Above, the </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Red Sword shared the sky with half a thousand stars. The night seemed oddly quiet to her, </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">though she could hear Yoren’s muttered snores, the crackle of the fire, even the muffled </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stirrings of the donkeys. Yet somehow it felt as though the world were holding its breath, and </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">the silence made her shiver. She went back to sleep clutching Needle. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Come morning, when Praed did not awaken, Arya realized that it had been his coughing </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she had missed. They dug a grave of their own then, burying the sellsword where he’d slept. </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Yoren stripped him of his valuables before they threw the dirt on him. One man claimed his </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">boots, another his dagger. His mail-shirt and helm were parceled out. His longsword Yoren </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">handed to the Bull. “Arms like yours, might be you can learn to use this,” he told him. A boy </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">called Tarber tossed a handful of acorns on top of Praed’s body, so an oak might grow to </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">mark his place. </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That evening they stopped in a village at an ivy-covered inn. Yoren counted the coins in </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his purse and decided they had enough for a hot meal. “We’ll sleep outside, same as ever, but </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="592" height="15" font="1">they got a bathhouse here, if any of you feels the need o’ hot water and a lick o’ soap.” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya did not dare, even though she smelled as bad as Yoren by now, all sour and stinky. </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Some of the creatures living in her clothes had come all the way from Flea Bottom with her; it </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">didn’t seem right to drown them. Tarber and Hot Pie and the Bull joined the line of men </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">headed for the tubs. Others settled down in front of the bathhouse. The rest crowded into the </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">common room. Yoren even sent Lommy out with tankards for the three in fetters, who’d been </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">left chained up in the back of their wagon. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Washed and unwashed alike supped on hot pork pies and baked apples. The innkeeper </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gave them a round of beer on the house. “I had a brother took the black, years ago. Serving </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boy, clever, but one day he got seen filching pepper from m’lord’s table. He liked the taste of </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">it, is all. Just a pinch o’ pepper, but Ser Malcolm was a hard man. You get pepper on the </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="598" height="15" font="1">Wall?” When Yoren shook his head, the man sighed. “Shame. Lync loved that pepper.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Arya sipped at her tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face </text>

<text top="1062" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">made her sad to think of Sansa and her father. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The inn was full of people moving south, and the common room erupted in scorn when </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Yoren said they were traveling the other way. “You’ll be back soon enough,” the innkeeper </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That’s nothing to us,” Yoren insisted stubbornly. “Tully or Lannister, makes no matter. </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Lord Tully is my grandfather</i>, Arya thought. It mattered to <i>her</i>, but she chewed her lip </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">and kept quiet, listening. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It’s more than Lannister and Tully,” the innkeeper said. “There’s wild men down from </text>

<text top="341" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">Arya sat up straight, straining to hear. Did he mean <i>Robb?</i> </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I heard the boy rides to battle on a wolf,” said a yellow-haired man with a tankard in his </text>

<text top="411" left="171" width="179" height="15" font="1">“Fool’s talk.” Yoren spat. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="531" height="15" font="1">“The man I heard it from, he saw it himself. A wolf big as a horse, he swore.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Swearing don’t make it true, Hod,” the innkeeper said. “You keep swearing you’ll pay </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">what you owe me, and I’ve yet to see a copper.” The common room erupted in laughter, and </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="276" height="15" font="1">the man with the yellow hair turned red. </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It’s been a bad year for wolves,” volunteered a sallow man in a travel-stained green </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cloak. “Around the Gods Eye, the packs have grown bolder’n anyone can remember. Sheep, </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cows, dogs, makes no matter, they kill as they like, and they got no fear of men. It’s worth </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">your life to go into those woods by night.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">“Ah, that’s more tales, and no more true than the other.” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I heard the same thing from my cousin, and she’s not the sort to lie,” an old woman said. </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“She says there’s this great pack, hundreds of them, man-killers. The one that leads them is a </text>

<text top="698" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>A she-wolf.</i> Arya sloshed her beer, wondering. Was the Gods Eye near the Trident? She </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">wished she had a map. It had been near the Trident that she’d left Nymeria. She hadn’t wanted </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to, but Jory said they had no choice, that if the wolf came back with them she’d be killed for </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">biting Joffrey, even though he’d deserved it. They’d had to shout and scream and throw </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stones, and it wasn’t until a few of Arya’s stones struck home that the direwolf had finally </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stopped following them. <i>She probably wouldn’t even know me now</i>, Arya thought. <i>Or if she </i></text>
<text top="815" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="5"><i>did, she’d hate me.</i> </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The man in the green cloak said, “I heard how this hellbitch walked into a village one </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">day . . . a market day, people everywhere, and she walks in bold as you please and tears a </text>

<text top="943" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That’s just a story,” Arya blurted out before she could stop herself. “Wolves don’t eat </text>

<text top="987" left="171" width="526" height="15" font="1">“And what would you know about it, lad?” asked the man in the green cloak. </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Before she could think of an answer, Yoren had her by the arm. “The boy’s greensick on </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">men are talking.” He gave her a stiff shove, toward the side door that led back to the stables. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="414" height="15" font="1">“Go on now. See that the stableboy has watered our horses.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya went outside, stiff with fury. “They <i>don’t</i>,” she muttered, kicking at a rock as she </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">stalked off. It went rolling and fetched up under the wagons. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="338" height="15" font="1">“Boy,” a friendly voice called out. “Lovely boy.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">One of the men in irons was talking to her. Warily, Arya approached the wagon, one </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">hand on Needle’s hilt. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The prisoner lifted an empty tankard, his chains rattling. “A man could use another taste </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of beer. A man has a thirst, wearing these heavy bracelets.” He was the youngest of the three, </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slender, fine-featured, always smiling. His hair was red on one side and white on the other, all </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">matted and filthy from cage and travel. “A man could use a bath too,” he said, when he saw </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">the way Arya was looking at him. “A boy could make a friend.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="190" height="15" font="1">“I have friends,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“None I can see,” said the one without a nose. He was squat and thick, with huge hands. </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Black hair covered his arms and legs and chest, even his back. He reminded Arya of a </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drawing she had once seen in a book, of an ape from the Summer Isles. The hole in his face </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="250" height="15" font="1">made it hard to look at him for long. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The bald one opened his mouth and <i>hissed</i> like some immense white lizard. When Arya </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flinched back, startled, he opened his mouth wide and waggled his tongue at her, only it was </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="364" height="15" font="1">more a stump than a tongue. “Stop that,” she blurted. </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A man does not choose his companions in the black cells,” the handsome one with the </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">red-and-white hair said. Something about the way he talked reminded her of Syrio; it was the </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same, yet different too. “These two, they have no courtesy. A man must ask forgiveness. You </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">are called Arry, is that not so?” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Lumpyhead,” said the noseless one. “Lumpyhead Lumpyface Stickboy. Have a care, </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">Lorath, he’ll hit you with his stick.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A man must be ashamed of the company he keeps, Arry,” the handsome one said. “This </text>

<text top="745" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">at the noseless man—“and Biter.” Biter <i>hissed</i> at her again, displaying a mouthful of yellowed </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">teeth filed into points. “A man must have some name, is that not so? Biter cannot speak and </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Biter cannot write, yet his teeth are very sharp, so a man calls him Biter and he smiles. Are </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">you charmed?” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Arya backed away from the wagon. “No.” <i>They can’t hurt me</i>, she told herself, <i>they’re </i></text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="5"><i>all chained up.</i> </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">He turned his tankard upside down. “A man must weep.” </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Rorge, the noseless one, flung his drinking cup at her with a curse. His manacles made </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him clumsy, yet even so he would have sent the heavy pewter tankard crashing into her head </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="447" height="15" font="1">if Arya hadn’t leapt aside. “You get us some beer, pimple. <i>Now!</i>” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You shut your mouth!” Arya tried to think what Syrio would have done. She drew her </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">wooden practice sword. </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Come closer,” Rorge said, “and I’ll shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="1">bloody.” </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Fear cuts deeper than swords.</i> Arya made herself approach the wagon. Every step was </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">harder than the one before. <i>Fierce as a wolverine, calm as still water.</i> The words sang in her </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">head. Syrio would not have been afraid. She was almost close enough to touch the wheel </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">when Biter lurched to his feet and grabbed for her, his irons clanking and rattling. The </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">manacles brought his hands up short, half a foot from her face. He <i>hissed</i>. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="324" height="15" font="1">She hit him. Hard, right between his little eyes. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Screaming, Biter reeled back, and then threw all his weight against his chains. The links </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slithered and turned and grew taut, and Arya heard the creak of old dry wood as the great iron </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rings strained against the floorboards of the wagon. Huge pale hands groped for her while </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">veins bulged along Biter’s arms, but the bonds held, and finally the man collapsed backward. </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="334" height="15" font="1">Blood ran from the weeping sores on his cheeks. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A boy has more courage than sense,” the one who had named himself Jaqen H’ghar </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">observed. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya edged backward away from the wagon. When she felt the hand on her shoulder, she </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="624" height="15" font="1">whirled, bringing up her stick sword again, but it was only the Bull. “What are you doing?” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="577" height="15" font="1">He raised his hands defensively. “Yoren said none of us should go near those three.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="236" height="15" font="1">“They don’t scare me,” Arya said. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then you’re stupid. They scare <i>me</i>.” The Bull’s hand fell to the hilt of his sword, and </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="352" height="15" font="1">Rorge began to laugh. “Let’s get away from them.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya scuffed at the ground with her foot, but she let the Bull lead her around to the front </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the inn. Rorge’s laughter and Biter’s hissing followed them. “Want to fight?” she asked the </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">Bull. She wanted to hit something. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He blinked at her, startled. Strands of thick black hair, still wet from the bathhouse, fell </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">across his deep blue eyes. “I’d hurt you.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="125" height="15" font="1">“You would not.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="249" height="15" font="1">“You don’t know how strong I am.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="245" height="15" font="1">“You don’t know how quick I am.” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You’re asking for it, Arry.” He drew Praed’s longsword. “This is cheap steel, but it’s a </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">real sword.” </text>
<text top="709" left="171" width="485" height="15" font="1">Arya unsheathed Needle. “This is good steel, so it’s realer than yours.” </text>
<text top="734" left="171" width="403" height="15" font="1">The Bull shook his head. “Promise not to cry if I cut you?” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll promise if you will.” She turned sideways, into her water dancer’s stance, but the </text>
<text top="779" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">Bull did not move. He was looking at something behind her. “What’s wrong?” </text>
<text top="804" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“Gold cloaks.” His face closed up tight. </text>
<text top="829" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="5"><i>It couldn’t be</i>, Arya thought, but when she glanced back, they were riding up the </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kingsroad, six in the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. One was an officer; </text>
<text top="868" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he wore a black enamel breastplate ornamented with four golden disks. They drew up in front </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the inn. <i>Look with your eyes</i>, Syrio’s voice seemed to whisper. Her eyes saw white lather </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">under their saddles; the horses had been ridden long and hard. Calm as still water, she took the </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">Bull by the arm and drew him back behind a tall flowering hedge. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="373" height="15" font="1">“What is it?” he asked. “What are you doing? Let go.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">“<i>Quiet as a shadow</i>,” she whispered, pulling him down. </text>
<text top="1002" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Some of Yoren’s other charges were sitting in front of the bathhouse, waiting their turn at </text>
<text top="1021" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">a tub. “You men,” one of the gold cloaks shouted. “You the ones left to take the black?” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“We might be,” came the cautious answer. </text>
<text top="1071" left="171" width="545" height="15" font="1">“We’d rather join you boys,” old Reysen said. “We hear it’s <i>cold</i> on that Wall.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="504" height="15" font="1">The gold cloak officer dismounted. “I have a warrant for a certain boy—” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Yoren stepped out of the inn, fingering his tangled black beard. “Who is it wants this </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">boy?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The other gold cloaks were dismounting to stand beside their horses. “Why are we </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">hiding?” the Bull whispered. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="572" height="15" font="1">“It’s me they want,” Arya whispered back. His ear smelled of soap. “You be quiet.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The queen wants him, old man, not that it’s your concern,” the officer said, drawing a </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">ribbon from his belt. “Here, Her Grace’s seal and warrant.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Behind the hedge, the Bull shook his head doubtfully. “Why would the queen want <i>you</i>, </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">Arry?” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="263" height="15" font="1">She punched his shoulder. “<i>Be quiet!</i>” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yoren fingered the warrant ribbon with its blob of golden wax. “Pretty.” He spit. “Thing </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="622" height="15" font="1">is, the boy’s in the Night’s Watch now. What he done back in the city don’t mean piss-all.” </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The queen’s not interested in your views, old man, and neither am I,” the officer said. </text>
<text top="422" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">“I’ll have the boy.” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya thought about running, but she knew she wouldn’t get far on her donkey when the </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gold cloaks had horses. And she was so tired of running. She’d run when Ser Meryn came for </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her, and again when they killed her father. If she was a real water dancer, she would go out </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">there with Needle and kill all of them, and never run from anyone ever again. </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="525" height="15" font="1">“You’ll have no one,” Yoren said stubbornly. “There’s laws on such things.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">The gold cloak drew a shortsword. “Here’s your law.” </text>
<text top="581" left="171" width="548" height="15" font="1">Yoren looked at the blade. “That’s no law, just a sword. Happens I got one too.” </text>
<text top="606" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">The officer smiled. “Old fool. I have five men with me.” </text>
<text top="631" left="171" width="242" height="15" font="1">Yoren spat. “Happens I got thirty.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The gold cloak laughed. “This lot?” said a big lout with a broken nose. “Who’s first?” he </text>
<text top="676" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">shouted, showing his steel. </text>
<text top="701" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">Tarber plucked a pitchfork out of a bale of hay. “I am.” </text>
<text top="726" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No, I am,” called Cutjack, the plump stonemason, pulling his hammer off the leather </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">apron he always wore. </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="465" height="15" font="1">“Me.” Kurz came up off the ground with his skinning knife in hand. </text>
<text top="796" left="171" width="282" height="15" font="1">“Me and him.” Koss strung his longbow. </text>
<text top="821" left="171" width="555" height="15" font="1">“All of us,” said Reysen, snatching up the tall hardwood walking staff he carried. </text>
<text top="846" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dobber stepped naked out of the bathhouse with his clothes in a bundle, saw what was </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="516" height="15" font="1">happening, and dropped everything but his dagger. “Is it a fight?” he asked. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I guess,” said Hot Pie, scrambling on all fours for a big rock to throw. Arya could not </text>
<text top="910" left="139" width="578" height="15" font="1">believe what she was seeing. She <i>hated</i> Hot Pie! Why would he risk himself for her? </text>
<text top="935" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The one with the broken nose still thought it was funny. “You girls put away them rocks </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="580" height="15" font="1">and sticks before you get spanked. None of you knows what end of a sword to hold.” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I<i> do!</i>” Arya wouldn’t let them die for her like Syrio. She wouldn’t! Shoving through the </text>
<text top="999" left="139" width="442" height="15" font="1">hedge with Needle in hand, she slid into a water dancer’s stance. </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Broken Nose guffawed. The officer looked her up and down. “Put the blade away, little </text>

</page>
<page number="49" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m <i>not</i> a girl!” she yelled, furious. What was wrong with them? They rode all this way </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">for her and here she was and they were just smiling at her. “I’m the one you want.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>He’s</i> the one we want.” The officer jabbed his shortsword toward the Bull, who’d come </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">forward to stand beside her, Praed’s cheap steel in his hand. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But it was a mistake to take his eyes off Yoren, even for an instant. Quick as that, the </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">black brother’s sword was pressed to the apple of the officer’s throat. “Neither’s the one you </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">get, less you want me to see if your apple’s ripe yet. I got me ten, fifteen more brothers in that </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">inn, if you still need convincing. I was you, I’d let loose of that gutcutter, spread my cheeks </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">over that fat little horse, and gallop on back to the city.” He spat, and poked harder with the </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">point of his sword. “Now.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="1">The officer’s fingers uncurled. His sword fell in the dust. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="534" height="15" font="1">“We’ll just keep that,” Yoren said. “Good steel’s always needed on the Wall.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As you say. For now. Men.” The gold cloaks sheathed and mounted up. “You’d best </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scamper up to that Wall of yours in a hurry, old man. The next time I catch you, I believe I’ll </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="312" height="15" font="1">have your head to go with the bastard boy’s.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Better men than you have tried.” Yoren slapped the rump of the officer’s horse with the </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">flat of his sword and sent him reeling off down the kingsroad. His men followed. </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When they were out of sight, Hot Pie began to whoop, but Yoren looked angrier than </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ever. “Fool! You think he’s done with us? Next time he won’t prance up and hand me no </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">damn ribbon. Get the rest out o’ them baths, we need to be moving. Ride all night, maybe we </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">can stay ahead o’ them for a bit.” He scooped up the shortsword the officer had dropped. </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">“Who wants this?” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="153" height="15" font="1">“Me!” Hot Pie yelled. </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Don’t be using it on Arry.” He handed the boy the sword, hilt-first, and walked over to </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">Arya, but it was the Bull he spoke to. “Queen wants you bad, boy.” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="305" height="15" font="1">Arya was lost. “Why should she want <i>him?</i>” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Bull scowled at her. “Why should she want <i>you?</i> You’re nothing but a little gutter </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="35" height="15" font="1">rat!” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Well, you’re nothing but a bastard boy!” Or maybe he was only <i>pretending</i> to be a </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="270" height="15" font="1">bastard boy. “What’s your true name?” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">“Gendry,” he said, like he wasn’t quite sure. </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Don’t see why no one wants neither o’ you,” Yoren said, “but they can’t have you </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">regardless. You ride them two coursers. First sight of a gold cloak, make for the Wall like a </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="424" height="15" font="1">dragon’s on your tail. The rest o’ us don’t mean spit to them.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="531" height="15" font="1">“Except for you,” Arya pointed out. “That man said he’d take your head too.” </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="581" height="15" font="1">“Well, as to that,” Yoren said, “if he can get it off my shoulders, he’s welcome to it.” </text>

<text top="1002" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The air smelled of paper and dust and years. Before him, tall wooden shelves rose up into </text>
<text top="1021" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dimness, crammed with leather-bound books and bins of ancient scrolls. A faint yellow glow </text>
<text top="1041" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">filtered through the stacks from some hidden lamp. Jon blew out the taper he carried, </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he was a shadow among shadows, dark of hair, long of face, grey of eye. Black moleskin </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Samwell Tarly sat hunched over a table in a niche carved into the stone of the wall. The </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">glow came from the lamp hung over his head. He looked up at the sound of Jon’s steps. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="222" height="15" font="1">“Have you been here all night?” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“Have I?” Sam looked startled. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You didn’t break your fast with us, and your bed hadn’t been slept in.” Rast suggested </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that maybe Sam had deserted, but Jon never believed it. Desertion required its own sort of </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">courage, and Sam had little enough of that. </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“Is it morning? Down here there’s no way to know.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sam, you’re a sweet fool,” Jon said. “You’ll miss that bed when we’re sleeping on the </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">cold hard ground, I promise you.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sam yawned. “Maester Aemon sent me to find maps for the Lord Commander. I never </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="547" height="15" font="1">thought . . . Jon, the <i>books</i>, have you ever seen their like? There are <i>thousands!</i>” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He gazed about him. “The library at Winterfell has more than a hundred. Did you find </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">the maps?” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Oh, yes.” Sam’s hand swept over the table, fingers plump as sausages indicating the </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">clutter of books and scrolls before him. “A dozen, at the least.” He unfolded a square of </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">parchment. “The paint has faded, but you can see where the mapmaker marked the sites of </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wildling villages, and there’s another book . . . where is it now? I was reading it a moment </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">ago.” He shoved some scrolls aside to reveal a dusty volume bound in rotted leather. “<i>This</i>,” </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he said reverently, “is the account of a journey from the Shadow Tower all the way to Lorn </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Point on the Frozen Shore, written by a ranger named Redwyn. It’s not dated, but he mentions </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a Dorren Stark as King in the North, so it must be from before the Conquest. Jon, they fought </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>giants!</i> Redwyn even traded with the children of the forest, it’s all here.” Ever so delicately, </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">he turned pages with a finger. “He drew maps as well, see . . .” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="398" height="15" font="1">“Maybe you could write an account of our ranging, Sam.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He’d meant to sound encouraging, but it was the wrong thing to say. The last thing Sam </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">needed was to be reminded of what faced them on the morrow. He shuffled the scrolls about </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">aimlessly. “There’s more maps. If I had time to search . . . everything’s a jumble. I could set it </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">all to order, though; I know I could, but it would take time . . . well, <i>years</i>, in truth.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Mormont wanted those maps a little sooner than that.” Jon plucked a scroll from a bin, </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blew off the worst of the dust. A corner flaked off between his fingers as he unrolled it. </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">“Look, this one is crumbling,” he said, frowning over the faded script. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Be gentle.” Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if </text>

<text top="917" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">them. Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Well, don’t bother copying that one. Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod, eighteen jars </text>

<text top="987" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">“An inventory,” Sam said, “or perhaps a bill of sale.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="570" height="15" font="1">“Who cares how much pickled cod they ate six hundred years ago?” Jon wondered. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I would.” Sam carefully replaced the scroll in the bin from which Jon had plucked it. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“You can learn so much from ledgers like that, truly you can. It can tell you how many men </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="457" height="15" font="1">were in the Night’s Watch then, how they lived, what they ate . . .” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">“They ate food,” said Jon, “and they lived as we live.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“You’d be surprised. This vault is a treasure, Jon.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“If you say so.” Jon was doubtful. Treasure meant gold, silver, and jewels, not dust, </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">spiders, and rotting leather. </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I do,” the fat boy blurted. He was older than Jon, a man grown by law, but it was hard to </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">think of him as anything but a boy. “I found drawings of the faces in the trees, and a book </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">about the tongue of the children of the forest . . . works that even the Citadel doesn’t have, </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">scrolls from old Valyria, counts of the seasons written by maesters dead a thousand years . . .” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“The books will still be here when we return.” </text>

<text top="397" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The Old Bear is taking two hundred seasoned men, three-quarters of them rangers. </text>

<text top="461" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Samwell Tarly managed a sad little smile. “I was never very safe in my father’s castle </text>

<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>The gods play cruel jests</i>, Jon thought. Pyp and Toad, all a-lather to be a part of the great </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ranging, were to remain at Castle Black. It was Samwell Tarly, the self-proclaimed coward, </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grossly fat, timid, and near as bad a rider as he was with a sword, who must face the haunted </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">forest. The Old Bear was taking two cages of ravens, so they might send back word as they </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">went. Maester Aemon was blind and far too frail to ride with them, so his steward must go in </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">his place. “We need you for the ravens, Sam. And someone has to help me keep Grenn </text>

<text top="647" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sam’s chins quivered. “You could care for the ravens, or Grenn could, or <i>anyone</i>,” he </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">said with a thin edge of desperation in his voice. “I could show you how. You know your </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="506" height="15" font="1">letters too, you could write down Lord Mormont’s messages as well as I.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m the Old Bear’s steward. I’ll need to squire for him, tend his horse, set up his tent; I </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">won’t have time to watch over birds as well. Sam, you said the words. You’re a brother of the </text>

<text top="775" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“A brother of the Night’s Watch shouldn’t be so scared.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“We’re all scared. We’d be fools if we weren’t.” Too many rangers had been lost the past </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">two years, even Benjen Stark, Jon’s uncle. They had found two of his uncle’s men in the </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wood, slain, but the corpses had risen in the chill of night. Jon’s burnt fingers twitched as he </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remembered. He still saw the wight in his dreams, dead Othor with the burning blue eyes and </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the cold black hands, but that was the last thing Sam needed to be reminded of. “There’s no </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shame in fear, my father told me, what matters is how we face it. Come, I’ll help you gather </text>

<text top="943" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Sam nodded unhappily. The shelves were so closely spaced that they had to walk single-</text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">file as they left. The vault opened onto one of the tunnels the brothers called the wormwalks, </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">winding subterranean passages that linked the keeps and towers of Castle Black under the </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">earth. In summer the wormwalks were seldom used, save by rats and other vermin, but winter </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was a different matter. When the snows drifted forty and fifty feet high and the ice winds </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">came howling out of the north, the tunnels were all that held Castle Black together. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Soon</i>, Jon thought as they climbed. He’d seen the harbinger that had come to Maester </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Aemon with word of summer’s end, the great raven of the Citadel, white and silent as Ghost. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He had seen a winter once, when he was very young, but everyone agreed that it had been a </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">short one, and mild. This one would be different. He could feel it in his bones. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The steep stone steps had Sam puffing like a blacksmith’s bellows by the time they </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">reached the surface. They emerged into a brisk wind that made Jon’s cloak swirl and snap. </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ghost was stretched out asleep beneath the wattle-and-daub wall of the granary, but he woke </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">when Jon appeared, bushy white tail held stiffly upright as he trotted to them. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sam squinted up at the Wall. It loomed above them, an icy cliff seven hundred feet high. </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sometimes it seemed to Jon almost a living thing, with moods of its own. The color of the ice </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was wont to change with every shift of the light. Now it was the deep blue of frozen rivers, </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">now the dirty white of old snow, and when a cloud passed before the sun it darkened to the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pale grey of pitted stone. The Wall stretched east and west as far as the eye could see, so huge </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that it shrunk the timbered keeps and stone towers of the castle to insignificance. It was the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">end of the world. </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="195" height="15" font="5"><i>And we are going beyond it.</i> </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The morning sky was streaked by thin grey clouds, but the pale red line was there behind </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">them. The black brothers had dubbed the wanderer Mormont’s Torch, saying (only half in </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">jest) that the gods must have sent it to light the old man’s way through the haunted forest. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The comet’s so bright you can see it by day now,” Sam said, shading his eyes with a </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">fistful of books. </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="403" height="15" font="1">“Never mind about comets, it’s maps the Old Bear wants.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ghost loped ahead of them. The grounds seemed deserted this morning, with so many </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">rangers off at the brothel in Mole’s Town, digging for buried treasure and drinking themselves </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blind. Grenn had gone with them. Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">woman to celebrate his first ranging. They’d wanted Jon and Sam to come as well, but Sam </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="418" height="15" font="1">part of it. “Do what you want,” he told Toad, “I took a vow.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As they passed the sept, he heard voices raised in song. <i>Some men want whores on the </i></text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>eve of battle, and some want gods.</i> Jon wondered who felt better afterward. The sept tempted </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him no more than the brothel; his own gods kept their temples in the wild places, where the </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weirwoods spread their bone-white branches. <i>The Seven have no power beyond the Wall</i>, he </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">thought, <i>but my gods will be waiting.</i> </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Outside the armory, Ser Endrew Tarth was working with some raw recruits. They’d come </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">in last night with Conwy, one of the wandering crows who roamed the Seven Kingdoms </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">collecting men for the Wall. This new crop consisted of a greybeard leaning on a staff, two </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blond boys with the look of brothers, a foppish youth in soiled satin, a raggy man with a </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">clubfoot, and some grinning loon who must have fancied himself a warrior. Ser Endrew was </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">showing him the error of that presumption. He was a gentler master-at-arms than Ser Alliser </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Thorne had been, but his lessons would still raise bruises. Sam winced at every blow, but Jon </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="260" height="15" font="1">Snow watched the swordplay closely. </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“What do you make of them, Snow?” Donal Noye stood in the door of his armory, bare-</text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chested under a leather apron, the stump of his left arm uncovered for once. With his big gut </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and barrel chest, his flat nose and bristly black jaw, Noye did not make a pretty sight, but he </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="546" height="15" font="1">was a welcome one nonetheless. The armorer had proved himself a good friend. </text>
<text top="1042" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They smell of summer,” Jon said as Ser Endrew bull-rushed his foe and knocked him </text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">sprawling. “Where did Conwy find them?” </text>

<page number="53" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A lord’s dungeon near Gulltown,” the smith replied. “A brigand, a barber, a beggar, two </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">orphans, and a boy whore. With such do we defend the realms of men.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“They’ll do.” Jon gave Sam a private smile. “We did.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="474" height="15" font="1">Noye drew him closer. “You’ve heard these tidings of your brother?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Last night.” Conwy and his charges had brought the news north with them, and the talk </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">in the common room had been of little else. Jon was still not certain how he felt about it. Robb </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a king? The brother he’d played with, fought with, shared his first cup of wine with? <i>But not </i></text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="5"><i>mother’s milk, no. So now Robb will sip summerwine from jeweled goblets, while I’m </i></text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>kneeling beside some stream sucking snowmelt from cupped hands.</i> “Robb will make a good </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">king,” he said loyally. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Will he now?” The smith eyed him frankly. “I hope that’s so, boy, but once I might </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">have said the same of Robert.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="393" height="15" font="1">“They say you forged his warhammer,” Jon remembered. </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aye. I was his man, a Baratheon man, smith and armorer at Storm’s End until I lost the </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">arm. I’m old enough to remember Lord Steffon before the sea took him, and I knew those </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">three sons of his since they got their names. I tell you this—Robert was never the same after </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he put on that crown. Some men are like swords, made for fighting. Hang them up and they </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">go to rust.” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="214" height="15" font="1">“And his brothers?” Jon asked. </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The armorer considered that a moment. “Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He’ll break before he bends. And </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Renly, that one, he’s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">the end of the day.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>And what metal is Robb?</i> Jon did not ask. Noye was a Baratheon man; likely he thought </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Joffrey the lawful king and Robb a traitor. Among the brotherhood of the Night’s Watch, </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">there was an unspoken pact never to probe too deeply into such matters. Men came to the </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Wall from all of the Seven Kingdoms, and old loves and loyalties were not easily forgotten, </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">no matter how many oaths a man swore . . . as Jon himself had good reason to know. Even </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Sam—his father’s House was sworn to Highgarden, whose Lord Tyrell supported King </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Renly. Best not to talk of such things. The Night’s Watch took no sides. “Lord Mormont </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">awaits us,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I won’t keep you from the Old Bear.” Noye clapped him on the shoulder and smiled. </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“May the gods go with you on the morrow, Snow. You bring back that uncle of yours, you </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">hear?” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“We will,” Jon promised him. </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Commander Mormont had taken up residence in the King’s Tower after the fire had </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gutted his own. Jon left Ghost with the guards outside the door. “More stairs,” said Sam </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="299" height="15" font="1">miserably as they started up. “I hate stairs.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="355" height="15" font="1">“Well, that’s one thing we won’t face in the wood.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When they entered the solar, the raven spied them at once. “<i>Snow!</i>” the bird shrieked. </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mormont broke off his conversation. “Took you long enough with those maps.” He pushed </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the remains of breakfast out of the way to make room on the table. “Put them here. I’ll have a </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">look at them later.” </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Thoren Smallwood, a sinewy ranger with a weak chin and a weaker mouth hidden under </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a thin scraggle of beard, gave Jon and Sam a cool look. He had been one of Alliser Thorne’s </text>
<text top="1065" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">henchmen, and had no love for either of them. “The Lord Commander’s place is at Castle </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Black, lording and commanding,” he told Mormont, ignoring the newcomers, “it seems to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">The raven flapped big black wings. “<i>Me, me, me.</i>” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you are ever Lord Commander, you may do as you please,” Mormont told the ranger, </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="596" height="15" font="1">“but it seems to <i>me</i> that I have not died yet, nor have the brothers put you in my place.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I’m First Ranger now, with Ben Stark lost and Ser Jaremy killed,” Smallwood said </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">stubbornly. “The command should be mine.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Mormont would have none of it. “I sent out Ben Stark, and Ser Waymar before him. I do </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not mean to send you after them and sit wondering how long I must wait before I give you up </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">for lost as well.” He pointed. “And Stark remains First Ranger until we know for a certainty </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that he is dead. Should that day come, it will be me who names his successor, not you. Now </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="465" height="15" font="1">stop wasting my time. We ride at first light, or have you forgotten?” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Smallwood pushed to his feet. “As my lord commands.” On the way out, he frowned at </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">Jon, as if it were somehow his fault. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“First Ranger!” The Old Bear’s eyes lighted on Sam. “I’d sooner name <i>you</i> First Ranger. </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He has the effrontery to tell me to my face that I’m too old to ride with him. Do I look old to </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you, boy?” The hair that had retreated from Mormont’s spotted scalp had regrouped beneath </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his chin in a shaggy grey beard that covered much of his chest. He thumped it hard. “Do I </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">look <i>frail?</i>” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sam opened his mouth, gave a little squeak. The Old Bear terrified him. “No, my lord,” </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="362" height="15" font="1">Jon offered quickly. “You look strong as a . . . a . . .” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Don’t cozen me, Snow, you know I won’t have it. Let me have a look at these maps.” </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Mormont pawed through them brusquely, giving each no more than a glance and a grunt. </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">“Was this all you could find?” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“I . . . m-m-my  lord,”  Sam  stammered,  “there . . . there  were  more,  b-b-but . . . the  dis-</text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="93" height="15" font="1">disorder . . .” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“These are old,” Mormont complained, and his raven echoed him with a sharp cry of </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="79" height="15" font="1">“<i>Old, old.</i>” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The villages may come and go, but the hills and rivers will be in the same places,” Jon </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">pointed out. </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">“True enough. Have you chosen your ravens yet, Tarly?” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="581" height="15" font="1">“M-m-maester Aemon m-means to p-pick them come evenfall, after the f-f-feeding.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“I’ll have his best. Smart birds, and strong.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“<i>Strong</i>,” his own bird said, preening. “<i>Strong, strong.</i>” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If it happens that we’re all butchered out there, I mean for my successor to know where </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="131" height="15" font="1">and how we died.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Talk of butchery reduced Samwell Tarly to speechlessness. Mormont leaned forward. </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Tarly, when I was a lad half your age, my lady mother told me that if I stood about with my </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mouth open, a weasel was like to mistake it for his lair and run down my throat. If you have </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">something to say, say it. Otherwise, beware of weasels.” He waved a brusque dismissal. “Off </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="569" height="15" font="1">with you, I’m too busy for folly. No doubt the maester has some work you can do.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sam swallowed, stepped back, and scurried out so quickly he almost tripped over the </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">rushes. </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Is that boy as big a fool as he seems?” the Lord Commander asked when he’d gone. </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">“<i>Fool</i>,” the raven complained. Mormont did not wait for Jon to answer. “His lord father </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Renly is not like to heed a quaking fat boy. I’ll send Ser Arnell. He’s a deal steadier, and his </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="411" height="15" font="1">“If it please my lord, what would you have of King Renly?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The same things I’d have of all of them, lad. Men, horses, swords, armor, grain, cheese, </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wine, wool, nails . . . the Night’s Watch is not proud, we take what is offered.” His fingers </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drummed against the roughhewn planks of the table. “If the winds have been kind, Ser Alliser </text>

<text top="271" left="139" width="582" height="15" font="1">him any heed, I do not know. House Lannister has never been a friend to the Watch.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Thorne has the wight’s hand to show them.” A grisly pale thing with black fingers, it </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="418" height="15" font="1">was, that twitched and stirred in its jar as if it were still alive. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“Would that we had another hand to send to Renly.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“Dywen says you can find anything beyond the Wall.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aye, Dywen says. And the last time he went ranging, he says he saw a bear fifteen feet </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">tall.” Mormont snorted. “My sister is said to have taken a bear for her lover. I’d believe <i>that</i> </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before I’d believe one fifteen feet tall. Though in a world where dead come walking . . . ah, </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">even so, a man must believe his eyes. I have seen the dead walk. I’ve not seen any giant </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">bears.” He gave Jon a long, searching look. “But we were speaking of hands. How is yours?” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Better.” Jon peeled off his moleskin glove and showed him. Scars covered his arm </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">halfway to the elbow, and the mottled pink flesh still felt tight and tender, but it was healing. </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“It itches, though. Maester Aemon says that’s good. He gave me a salve to take with me when </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">we ride.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“You can wield Longclaw despite the pain?” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Well enough.” Jon flexed his fingers, opening and closing his fist the way the maester </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had shown him. “I’m to work the fingers every day to keep them nimble, as Maester Aemon </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="1">said.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Blind he may be, but Aemon knows what he’s about. I pray the gods let us keep him </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">another twenty years. Do you know that he might have been king?” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jon was taken by surprise. “He told me his father was king, but not . . . I thought him </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="168" height="15" font="1">perhaps a younger son.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“So he was. His father’s father was Daeron Targaryen, the Second of His Name, who </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brought Dorne into the realm. Part of the pact was that he wed a Dornish princess. She gave </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him four sons. Aemon’s father Maekar was the youngest of those, and Aemon was <i>his</i> third </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">son. Mind you, all this happened long before I was born, ancient as Smallwood would make </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“Maester Aemon was named for the Dragonknight.” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“So he was. Some say Prince Aemon was King Daeron’s true father, not Aegon the </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Unworthy. Be that as it may, our Aemon lacked the Dragonknight’s martial nature. He likes </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to say he had a slow sword but quick wits. Small wonder his grandfather packed him off to </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Citadel. He was nine or ten, I believe . . . and ninth or tenth in the line of succession as </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">well.” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Aemon had counted more than a hundred name days, Jon knew. Frail, shrunken, </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">wizened, and blind, it was hard to imagine him as a little boy no older than Arya. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Mormont continued. “Aemon was at his books when the eldest of his uncles, the heir </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">apparent, was slain in a tourney mishap. He left two sons, but they followed him to the grave </text>

<page number="56" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not long after, during the Great Spring Sickness. King Daeron was also taken, so the crown </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">passed to Daeron’s second son, Aerys.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The Mad King?” Jon was confused. Aerys had been king before Robert, that wasn’t so </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">long ago. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="582" height="15" font="1">“No, this was Aerys the First. The one Robert deposed was the second of that name.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="182" height="15" font="1">“How long ago was this?” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Eighty years or close enough,” the Old Bear said, “and no, I <i>still</i> hadn’t been born, </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">though Aemon had forged half a dozen links of his maester’s chain by then. Aerys wed his </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">own sister, as the Targaryens were wont to do, and reigned for ten or twelve years. Aemon </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">took his vows and left the Citadel to serve at some lordling’s court . . . until his royal uncle </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">died without issue. The Iron Throne passed to the last of King Daeron’s four sons. That was </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Maekar, Aemon’s father. The new king summoned all his sons to court and would have made </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Aemon part of his councils, but he refused, saying that would usurp the place rightly </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">belonging to the Grand Maester. Instead he served at the keep of his eldest brother, another </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Daeron. Well, that one died too, leaving only a feeble-witted daughter as heir. Some pox he </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">caught from a whore, I believe. The next brother was Aerion.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Aerion the Monstrous?” Jon knew that name. “The Prince Who Thought He Was a </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">Dragon” was one of Old Nan’s more gruesome tales. His little brother Bran had loved it. </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The very one, though he named himself Aerion Brightflame. One night, in his cups, he </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">drank a jar of wildfire, after telling his friends it would transform him into a dragon, but the </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gods were kind and it transformed him into a corpse. Not quite a year after, King Maekar died </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="225" height="15" font="1">in battle against an outlaw lord.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon was not entirely innocent of the history of the realm; his own maester had seen to </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">that. “That was the year of the Great Council,” he said. “The lords passed over Prince </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="556" height="15" font="1">Aerion’s infant son and Prince Daeron’s daughter and gave the crown to Aegon.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes and no. First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon. And quietly he refused. The gods </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">meant for him to serve, not to rule, he told them. He had sworn a vow and would not break it, </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him. Well, no sane man wanted any blood </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Aerion’s on the throne, and Daeron’s girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">no choice but to turn to Aemon’s younger brother—Aegon, the Fifth of His Name. Aegon the </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Unlikely, they called him, born the fourth son of a fourth son. Aemon knew, and rightly, that </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">if he remained at court those who disliked his brother’s rule would seek to use him, so he </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">came to the Wall. And here he has remained, while his brother and his brother’s son and <i>his</i> </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">son each reigned and died in turn, until Jaime Lannister put an end to the line of the </text>

<text top="836" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“<i>King</i>,” croaked the raven. The bird flapped across the solar to land on Mormont’s </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">shoulder. “<i>King</i>,” it said again, strutting back and forth. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="271" height="15" font="1">“He likes that word,” Jon said, smiling. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">“An easy word to say. An easy word to like.” </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="190" height="15" font="1">“<i>King</i>,” the bird said again. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="363" height="15" font="1">“I think he means for you to have a crown, my lord.” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The realm has three kings already, and that’s two too many for my liking.” Mormont </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="636" height="15" font="1">stroked the raven under the beak with a finger, but all the while his eyes never left Jon Snow. </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="578" height="15" font="1">It made him feel odd. “My lord, why have you told me this, about Maester Aemon?” </text>

<page number="57" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Must I have a reason?” Mormont shifted in his seat, frowning. “Your brother Robb has </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">been crowned King in the North. You and Aemon have that in common. A king for a </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">brother.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="240" height="15" font="1">“And this too,” said Jon. “A vow.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Old Bear gave a loud snort, and the raven took flight, flapping in a circle about the </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">room, “Give me a man for every vow I’ve seen broken and the Wall will never lack for </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="419" height="15" font="1">“I’ve always known that Robb would be Lord of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Mormont gave a whistle, and the bird flew to him again and settled on his arm. “A lord’s </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one thing, a king’s another.” He offered the raven a handful of corn from his pocket. “They </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while </text>

<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Aegon the Conqueror when Torrhen Stark knelt in submission. What Aegon had done with it </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">no man could say. Lord Hoster’s smith had done his work well, and Robb’s crown looked </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old; an open </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords. Of gold and silver and gemstones, it had </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">none; bronze and iron were the metals of winter, dark and strong to fight against the cold. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As they waited in Riverrun’s Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before them, she </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">saw Robb push back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair; moments </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">later, he moved it forward again; later he gave it a quarter turn, as if that might make it sit </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">more easily on his brow. <i>It is no easy thing to wear a crown</i>, Catelyn thought, watching, </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="5"><i>especially for a boy of fifteen years.</i> </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">When the guards brought in the captive, Robb called for his sword. Olyvar Frey offered it </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up hilt-first, and her son drew the blade and laid it bare across his knees, a threat plain for all </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to see. “Your Grace, here is the man you asked for,” announced Ser Robin Ryger, captain of </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">the Tully household guard. </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Kneel before the king, Lannister!” Theon Greyjoy shouted. Ser Robin forced the </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="148" height="15" font="1">prisoner to his knees. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He did not look a lion, Catelyn reflected. This Ser Cleos Frey was a son of the Lady </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Genna who was sister to Lord Tywin Lannister, but he had none of the fabled Lannister </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beauty, the fair hair and green eyes. Instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks, weak </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chin, and thin face of his sire, Ser Emmon Frey, old Lord Walder’s second son. His eyes were </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pale and watery and he could not seem to stop blinking, but perhaps that was only the light. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="565" height="15" font="1">The cells below Riverrun were dark and damp . . . and these days crowded as well. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Rise, Ser Cleos.” Her son’s voice was not as icy as his father’s would have been, but he </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">did not sound a boy of fifteen either. War had made a man of him before his time. Morning </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="471" height="15" font="1">light glimmered faintly against the edge of the steel across his knees. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yet it was not the sword that made Ser Cleos Frey anxious; it was the beast. Grey Wind, </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her son had named him. A direwolf large as any elkhound, lean and smoke-dark, with eyes </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like molten gold. When the beast padded forward and sniffed at the captive knight, every man </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in that hall could smell the scent of fear. Ser Cleos had been taken during the battle in the </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">Whispering Wood, where Grey Wind had ripped out the throats of half a dozen men. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The knight scrambled up, edging away with such alacrity that some of the watchers </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="262" height="15" font="1">laughed aloud. “Thank you, my lord.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Your Grace</i>,” barked Lord Umber, the Greatjon, ever the loudest of Robb’s northern </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bannermen . . . and the  truest  and fiercest  as well, or so he insisted. He had been the first to </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">proclaim her son King in the North, and he would brook no slight to the honor of his new-</text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">made sovereign. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace,” Ser Cleos corrected hastily. “Pardons.” </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>He is not a bold man, this one</i>, Catelyn thought. More of a Frey than a Lannister, in truth. </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">His cousin the Kingslayer would have been a much different matter. They would never have </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">gotten that honorific through Ser Jaime Lannister’s perfect teeth. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I brought you from your cell to carry my message to your cousin Cersei Lannister in </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">King’s Landing. You’ll travel under a peace banner, with thirty of my best men to escort </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">you.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos was visibly relieved. “Then I should be most glad to bring His Grace’s </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">message to the queen.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Understand,” Robb said, “I am not giving you your freedom. Your grandfather Lord </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Walder pledged me his support and that of House Frey. Many of your cousins and uncles rode </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with us in the Whispering Wood, but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner. That makes </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">you a Lannister, not a Frey. I want your pledge, on your honor as a knight, that after you </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="580" height="15" font="1">deliver my message you’ll return with the queen’s reply, and resume your captivity.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos answered at once. “I do so vow.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Every man in this hall has heard you,” warned Catelyn’s brother Ser Edmure Tully, who </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">spoke for Riverrun and the lords of the Trident in the place of their dying father. “If you do </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">not return, the whole realm will know you forsworn.” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="506" height="15" font="1">“I will do as I pledged,” Ser Cleos replied stiffly. “What is this message?” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“An offer of peace.” Robb stood, longsword in hand. Grey Wind moved to his side. The </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hall grew hushed. “Tell the Queen Regent that if she meets my terms, I will sheath this sword, </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="282" height="15" font="1">and make an end to the war between us.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the back of the hall, Catelyn glimpsed the tall, gaunt figure of Lord Rickard Karstark </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">shove through a rank of guards and out the door. No one else moved. Robb paid the disruption </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">no mind. “Olyvar, the paper,” he commanded. The squire took his longsword and handed up a </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="124" height="15" font="1">rolled parchment. </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Robb unrolled it. “First, the queen must release my sisters and provide them with </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">transport by sea from King’s Landing to White Harbor. It is to be understood that Sansa’s </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sisters have returned unharmed to Winterfell, I will release the queen’s cousins, the squire </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Willem Lannister and your brother Tion Frey, and give them safe escort to Casterly Rock or </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">wheresoever she desires them delivered.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Catelyn Stark wished she could read the thoughts that hid behind each face, each </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">furrowed brow and pair of tightened lips. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Secondly, my lord father’s bones will be returned to us, so he may rest beside his </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell, as he would have wished. The remains of </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the men of his household guard who died in his service at King’s Landing must also be </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">returned.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Living men had gone south, and cold bones would return. <i>Ned had the truth of it</i>, she </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thought. <i>His place was at Winterfell, he said as much, but would I hear him? No. Go, I told </i></text>

<text top="380" left="171" width="569" height="15" font="1">“Third, my father’s greatsword Ice will be delivered to my hand, here at Riverrun.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She watched her brother Ser Edmure Tully as he stood with his thumbs hooked over his </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">swordbelt, his face as still as stone. </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Fourth, the queen will command her father Lord Tywin to release those knights and </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lords bannermen of mine that he took captive in the battle on the Green Fork of the Trident. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Once he does so, I shall release my own captives taken in the Whispering Wood and the </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Battle of the Camps, save Jaime Lannister alone, who will remain my hostage for his father’s </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="1">good behavior.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She studied Theon Greyjoy’s sly smile, wondering what it meant. That young man had a </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">way of looking as though he knew some secret jest that only he was privy to; Catelyn had </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">never liked it. </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lastly, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claims to dominion over </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the north. Henceforth we are no part of their realm, but a free and independent kingdom, as of </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">old. Our domain shall include all the Stark lands north of the Neck, and in addition the lands </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watered by the River Trident and its vassal streams, bounded by the Golden Tooth to the west </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">and the Mountains of the Moon in the east.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>THE KING IN THE NORTH!</i>” boomed Greatjon Umber, a ham-sized fist hammering at </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="411" height="15" font="1">the air as he shouted. “<i>Stark! Stark! The King in the North!</i>” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Robb rolled up the parchment again. “Maester Vyman has drawn a map, showing the </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">borders we claim. You shall have a copy for the queen. Lord Tywin must withdraw beyond </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">these borders, and cease his raiding, burning, and pillage. The Queen Regent and her son shall </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">make no claims to taxes, incomes, nor service from my people, and shall free my lords and </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knights from all oaths of fealty, vows, pledges, debts, and obligations owed to the Iron Throne </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">and the Houses Baratheon and Lannister. Additionally, the Lannisters shall deliver ten </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">highborn hostages, to be mutually agreed upon, as a pledge of peace. These I will treat as </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">honored guests, according to their station. So long as the terms of this pact are abided with </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">faithfully, I shall release two hostages every year, and return them safely to their families.” </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Robb tossed the rolled parchment at the knight’s feet. “There are the terms. If she meets them, </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">I’ll give her peace. If not”—he whistled, and Grey Wind moved forward snarling—“I’ll give </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="222" height="15" font="1">her another Whispering Wood.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Stark!</i>” the Greatjon roared again, and now other voices took up the cry. “<i>Stark, Stark, </i></text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="455" height="15" font="5"><i>King in the North!</i>” The direwolf threw back his head and howled. </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos had gone the color of curdled milk. “The queen shall hear your message, my— </text>

<page number="60" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Good,” Robb said. “Ser Robin, see that he has a good meal and clean clothing. He’s to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="405" height="15" font="1">“As you command, Your Grace,” Ser Robin Ryger replied. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Then we are done.” The assembled knights and lords bannermen bent their knees as </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Robb turned to leave, Grey Wind at his heels. Olyvar Frey scrambled ahead to open the door. </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="347" height="15" font="1">Catelyn followed them out, her brother at her side. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You did well,” she told her son in the gallery that led from the rear of the hall, “though </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="496" height="15" font="1">that business with the wolf was japery more befitting a boy than a king.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Robb scratched Grey Wind behind the ear. “Did you see the look on his face, Mother?” </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">he asked, smiling. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="320" height="15" font="1">“What I saw was Lord Karstark, walking out.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As did I.” Robb lifted off his crown with both hands and gave it to Olyvar. “Take this </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="217" height="15" font="1">thing back to my bedchamber.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“At once, Your Grace.” The squire hurried off. </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll wager there were others who felt the same as Lord Karstark,” her brother Edmure </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">declared. “How can we talk of peace while the Lannisters spread like a pestilence over my </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">father’s domains, stealing his crops and slaughtering his people? I say again, we ought to be </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="173" height="15" font="1">marching on Harrenhal.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“We lack the strength,” Robb said, though unhappily. </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">Edmure persisted. “Do we grow stronger sitting here? Our host dwindles every day.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And whose doing is that?” Catelyn snapped at her brother. It had been at Edmure’s </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">insistence that Robb had given the river lords leave to depart after his crowning, each to </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">defend his own lands. Ser Marq Piper and Lord Karyl Vance had been the first to go. Lord </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jonos Bracken had followed, vowing to reclaim the burnt shell of his castle and bury his dead, </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and now Lord Jason Mallister had announced his intent to return to his seat at Seagard, still </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">mercifully untouched by the fighting. </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You cannot ask my river lords to remain idle while their fields are being pillaged and </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their people put to the sword,” Ser Edmure said, “but Lord Karstark is a northman. It would </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">be an ill thing if he were to leave us.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll speak with him,” said Robb. “He lost two sons in the Whispering Wood. Who can </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">blame him if he does not want to make peace with their killers . . . with my father’s </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">killers . . .” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“More bloodshed will not bring your father back to us, or Lord Rickard’s sons,” Catelyn </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">said. “An offer had to be made—though a wiser man might have offered sweeter terms.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Any sweeter and I would have gagged.” Her son’s beard had grown in redder than his </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">auburn hair. Robb seemed to think it made him look fierce, royal . . . older. But bearded or no, </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he was still a youth of fifteen, and wanted vengeance no less than Rickard Karstark. It had </text>

<text top="558" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Robb made no answer, but there was hurt in his eyes. Blue eyes, Tully eyes, eyes she had </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">given him. She had wounded him, but he was too much his father’s son to admit it. </text>

<text top="711" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Plainly, he’d had enough of the subject. “Mother, are you certain you will not consent to </text>

<text top="993" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn ignored that. “I’ll say again, I would sooner you sent someone else to Pyke, and </text>

<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Robb stood. “I will not grudge him that. If I’m King in the North, let him be King of the </text>

<text top="461" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could only watch him go. Her son and now her king. How queer that felt. </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Command</i>, she had told him back in Moat Cailin. And so he did. “I am going to visit Father,” </text>

<text top="569" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>If he still lives</i>, Catelyn thought, but she said nothing. Her brother would sooner face </text>

<text top="614" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The shortest way to the central keep where her father lay dying was through the </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">godswood, with its grass and wildflowers and thick stands of elm and redwood. A wealth of </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rustling leaves still clung to the branches of the trees, all ignorant of the word the white raven </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had brought to Riverrun a fortnight past. Autumn had come, the Conclave had declared, but </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the gods had not seen fit to tell the winds and woods as yet. For that Catelyn was duly </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grateful. Autumn was always a fearful time, with the specter of winter looming ahead. Even </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="481" height="15" font="1">the wisest man never knew whether his next harvest would be the last. </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun, lay abed in his solar, with its commanding view to the </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">east where the rivers Tumblestone and Red Fork met beyond the walls of his castle. He was </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sleeping when Catelyn entered, his hair and beard as white as his featherbed, his once-portly </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">frame turned small and frail by the death that grew within him. </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Beside the bed, still dressed in mail hauberk and travel-stained cloak, sat her father’s </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brother, the Blackfish. His boots were dusty and spattered with dried mud. “Does Robb know </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">you are returned, Uncle?” Ser Brynden Tully was Robb’s eyes and ears, the commander of his </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">scouts and outriders. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No. I came here straight from the stables, when they told me the king was holding court. </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">His Grace will want to hear my tidings in private first I’d think.” The Blackfish was a tall, </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">lean man, grey of hair and precise in his movements, his clean-shaven face lined and wind-</text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">burnt. “How is he?” he asked, and she knew he did not mean Robb. </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Much the same. The maester gives him dreamwine and milk of the poppy for his pain, </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">so he sleeps most of the time, and eats too little. He seems weaker with each day that passes.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes . . . but there is less and less sense to the things he says. He talks of his regrets, of </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">unfinished tasks, of people long dead and times long past. Sometimes he does not know what </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">season it is, or who I am. Once he called me by Mother’s name.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He misses her still,” Ser Brynden answered. “You have her face. I can see it in your </text>

<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You remember more of her than I do. It has been a long time.” She seated herself on the </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">bed and brushed away a strand of fine white hair that had fallen across her father’s face. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Each time I ride out, I wonder if I shall find him alive or dead on my return.” Despite </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">their quarrels, there was a deep bond between her father and the brother he had once </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">disowned. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“At least you made your peace with him.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They sat for a time in silence, until Catelyn raised her head. “You spoke of tidings that </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Robb needed to hear?” Lord Hoster moaned and rolled onto his side, almost as if he had </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">heard. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="420" height="15" font="1">Brynden stood. “Come outside. Best if we do not wake him.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She followed him out onto the stone balcony that jutted three-sided from the solar like </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the prow of a ship. Her uncle glanced up, frowning. “You can see it by day now. My men call </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="353" height="15" font="1">it the Red Messenger . . . but what is the message?” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn raised her eyes, to where the faint red line of the comet traced a path across the </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deep blue sky like a long scratch across the face of god. “The Greatjon told Robb that the old </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gods have unfurled a red flag of vengeance for Ned. Edmure thinks it’s an omen of victory for </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Riverrun—he sees a fish with a long tail, in the Tully colors, red against blue.” She sighed. “I </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="359" height="15" font="1">wish I had their faith. Crimson is a Lannister color.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That thing’s not crimson,” Ser Brynden said. “Nor Tully red, the mud red of the river. </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="368" height="15" font="1">That’s blood up there, child, smeared across the sky.” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="156" height="15" font="1">“Our blood or theirs?” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Was there ever a war where only one side bled?” Her uncle gave a shake of the head. </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“The riverlands are awash in blood and flame all around the Gods Eye. The fighting has </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">spread south to the Blackwater and north across the Trident, almost to the Twins. Marq Piper </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Karyl Vance have won some small victories, and this southron lordling Beric Dondarrion </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">has been raiding the raiders, falling upon Lord Tywin’s foraging parties and vanishing back </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">into the woods. It’s said that Ser Burton Crakehall was boasting that he’d slain Dondarrion, </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">until he led his column into one of Lord Beric’s traps and got every man of them killed.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Some of Ned’s guard from King’s Landing are with this Lord Beric,” Catelyn recalled. </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">“May the gods preserve them.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Dondarrion and this red priest who rides with him are clever enough to preserve </text>

<text top="330" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“True enough,” Ser Brynden admitted. “And Tywin Lannister is no man’s fool. He sits </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">safe behind the walls of Harrenhal, feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not take. Gregor is not the only dog he’s loosed. Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well, and </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">some sellsword out of Qohor who’d sooner maim a man than kill him. I’ve seen what they </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">leave behind them. Whole villages put to the torch, women raped and mutilated, butchered </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs . . . it would sicken even the dead.” </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“When Edmure hears this, he will rage.” </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And that will be just as Lord Tywin desires. Even terror has its purpose, Cat. Lannister </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="211" height="15" font="1">wants to provoke us to battle.” </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Robb is like to give him that wish,” Catelyn said, fretful. “He is restless as a cat sitting </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">here, and Edmure and the Greatjon and the others will urge him on.” Her son had won two </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">great victories, smashing Jaime Lannister in the Whispering Wood and routing his leaderless </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">host outside the walls of Riverrun in the Battle of the Camps, but from the way some of his </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="516" height="15" font="1">bannermen spoke of him, he might have been Aegon the Conqueror reborn. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Brynden Blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow. “More fool they. My first rule of war, </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Cat—<i>never</i> give the enemy his wish. Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of his own </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">choosing. He wants us to march on Harrenhal.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Harrenhal.” Every child of the Trident knew the tales told of Harrenhal, the vast fortress </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that King Harren the Black had raised beside the waters of Gods Eye three hundred years past, </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when the Seven Kingdoms had <i>been</i> seven kingdoms, and the riverlands were ruled by the </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ironmen from the islands. In his pride, Harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in all Westeros. Forty years it had taken, rising like a great shadow on the shore of the lake </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">while Harren’s armies plundered his neighbors for stone, lumber, gold, and workers. </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Thousands of captives died in his quarries, chained to his sledges, or laboring on his five </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">colossal towers. Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer. Weirwoods that had stood </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">three thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters. Harren had beggared the riverlands </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and the Iron Islands alike to ornament his dream. And when at last Harrenhal stood complete, </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on the very day King Harren took up residence, Aegon the Conqueror had come ashore at </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">King’s Landing. </text>
<text top="928" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could remember hearing Old Nan tell the story to her own children, back at </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Winterfell. “And King Harren learned that thick walls and high towers are small use against </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dragons,” the tale always ended. “For dragons <i>fly</i>.” Harren and all his line had perished in the </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress, and every house that held Harrenhal since had come </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">to misfortune. Strong it might be, but it was a dark place, and cursed. </text>
<text top="1031" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I would not have Robb fight a battle in the shadow of that keep,” Catelyn admitted. “Yet </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And soon,” her uncle agreed. “I have not told you the worst of it, child. The men I sent </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">west have brought back word that a new host is gathering at Casterly Rock.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Another Lannister army.</i> The thought made her ill. “Robb must be told at once. Who will </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="86" height="15" font="1">command?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ser Stafford Lannister, it’s said.” He turned to gaze out over the rivers, his red-and-blue </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">cloak stirring in the breeze. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Another nephew?” The Lannisters of Casterly Rock were a damnably large and fertile </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">house. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Cousin,” Ser Brynden corrected. “Brother to Lord Tywin’s late wife, so twice related. </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">An old man and a bit of a dullard, but he has a son, Ser Daven, who is more formidable.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="572" height="15" font="1">“Then let us hope it is the father and not the son who takes this army into the field.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“We have some time yet before we must face them. This lot will be sellswords, </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">freeriders, and green boys from the stews of Lannisport. Ser Stafford must see that they are </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">armed and drilled before he dare risk battle . . . and make no mistake, Lord Tywin is not the </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Kingslayer. He will not rush in heedless. He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="355" height="15" font="1">before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="183" height="15" font="1">“Unless . . .” said Catelyn. </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="216" height="15" font="1">“Yes?” Ser Brynden prompted. </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="491" height="15" font="1">“Unless he <i>must</i> leave Harrenhal,” she said, “to face some other threat.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="356" height="15" font="1">Her uncle looked at her thoughtfully. “Lord Renly.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>King</i> Renly.” If she would ask help from the man, she would need to grant him the style </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">he had claimed for himself. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="583" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps.” The Blackfish smiled a dangerous smile. “He’ll want something, though.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="405" height="15" font="1">“He’ll want what kings always want,” she said. “Homage.” </text>

<text top="726" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Janos Slynt was a butcher’s son, and he laughed like a man chopping meat. “More </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="180" height="15" font="1">wine?” Tyrion asked him. </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I should not object,” Lord Janos said, holding out his cup. He was built like a keg, and </text>
<text top="790" left="139" width="582" height="15" font="1">had a similar capacity. “I should not object at all. That’s a fine red. From the Arbor?” </text>
<text top="815" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Dornish.” Tyrion gestured, and his serving man poured. But for the servants, he and </text>
<text top="835" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lord Janos were alone in the Small Hall, at a small candlelit table surrounded by darkness. </text>
<text top="854" left="139" width="364" height="15" font="1">“Quite the find. Dornish wines are not often so rich.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Rich,” said the big frog-faced man, taking a healthy gulp. He was not a man for sipping, </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Janos Slynt. Tyrion had made note of that at once. “Yes, rich, that’s the very word I was </text>
<text top="918" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">searching for, the <i>very</i> word. You have a gift for words, Lord Tyrion, if I might say so. And </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">you tell a droll tale. Droll, yes.” </text>
<text top="963" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m pleased you think so . . . but I’m not a lord, as you are. A simple <i>Tyrion</i> will suffice </text>
<text top="982" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">for me, Lord Janos.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As you wish.” He took another swallow, dribbling wine on the front of his black satin </text>
<text top="1027" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">doublet. He was wearing a cloth-of-gold half-cape fastened with a miniature spear, its point </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">enameled in dark red. And he was well and truly drunk. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely. Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the wine, but he was very full. The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service. </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">This evening they had supped on oxtail soup, summer greens tossed with pecans, grapes, red </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fennel, and crumbled cheese, hot crab pie, spiced squash, and quails drowned in butter. Each </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dish had come with its own wine. Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well. </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="544" height="15" font="1">“No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal,” Tyrion said. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“For a certainty. Perhaps I should ask this cook of yours to enter my service, what do you </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">say?” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Wars have been fought over less,” he said, and they both had a good long laugh. </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">“You’re a bold man to take Harrenhal for your seat. Such a grim place, and <i>huge</i> . . . costly to </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="280" height="15" font="1">maintain. And some say cursed as well.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Should I fear a pile of stone?” He hooted at the notion. “A bold man, you said. You </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">must be bold, to rise. As I have. To Harrenhal, yes! And why not? You know. You are a bold </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="301" height="15" font="1">man too, I sense. Small, mayhap, but <i>bold</i>.” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="223" height="15" font="1">“You are too kind. More wine?” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="578" height="15" font="1">“No. No, truly, I . . . oh, gods be damned, <i>yes</i>. Why not? A bold man drinks his fill!” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Truly.” Tyrion filled Lord Slynt’s cup to the brim. “I have been glancing over the names </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="481" height="15" font="1">you put forward to take your place as Commander of the City Watch.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Good men. Fine men. Any of the six will do, but I’d choose Allar Deem. My right arm. </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="556" height="15" font="1">Good good man. Loyal. Pick him and you won’t be sorry. If he pleases the king.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“To be sure.” Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine. “I had been considering Ser </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jacelyn Bywater. He’s been captain on the Mud Gate for three years, and he served with valor </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">during Balon Greyjoy’s Rebellion. King Robert knighted him at Pyke. And yet his name does </text>

<text top="642" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Janos Slynt took a gulp of wine and sloshed it around in his mouth for a moment </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">before swallowing. “Bywater. Well. Brave man, to be sure, yet . . . he’s <i>rigid</i>, that one. A </text>

<text top="700" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knighted. A poor trade, if you ask me, a hand for a <i>ser</i>.” He laughed. “Ser Jacelyn thinks </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">overmuch of himself and his honor, as I see it. You’ll do better leaving that one where he is, </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="1">my lor— Tyrion. Allar Deem’s the man for you.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">“Deem is little loved in the streets, I am told.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">“He’s feared. That’s better.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">“What was it I heard of him? Some trouble in a brothel?” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That. Not his fault, my lor— Tyrion. No. He never meant to kill the woman, that was </text>

<text top="948" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“A good commander knows his men, Tyrion. Some are good for one job, some for </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">another. Doing for a babe, and her still on the tit, that takes a certain sort. Not every man’d do </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">it. Even if it was only some whore and her whelp.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I suppose that’s so,” said Tyrion, hearing <i>only some whore</i> and thinking of Shae, and </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Slynt went on, oblivious. “A hard man for a hard job, is Deem. Does as he’s told, and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">never a word afterward.” He cut a slice off the cheese. “This <i>is</i> fine. Sharp. Give me a good </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">sharp knife and a good sharp cheese and I’m a happy man.” </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Janos gave Tyrion a wary look, then laughed and wagged a wedge of cheese at him. </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“You’re a sly one, Tyrion. Thought you could trick me, did you? It takes more than wine and </text>

<text top="291" left="139" width="263" height="15" font="1">never a word afterward, not with me.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="121" height="15" font="1">“As with Deem.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Just the same. You make him your Commander when I’m off to Harrenhal, and you </text>

<text top="386" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion broke off a nibble of the cheese. It was sharp indeed, and veined with wine; very </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">choice. “Whoever the king names will not have an easy time stepping into <i>your</i> armor, I can </text>

<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Janos looked puzzled. “I thought she was a lady. Mormont. Beds down with bears, </text>

<text top="494" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“It was her brother I was speaking of. Jeor Mormont, the Lord Commander of the Night’s </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Watch. When I was visiting with him on the Wall, he mentioned how concerned he was about </text>

<text top="553" left="139" width="627" height="15" font="1">grinned. “He’d sleep easier if he had a man like you, I imagine. Or the valiant Allar Deem.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">Lord Janos roared. “Small chance of that!” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“One would think,” Tyrion said, “but life does take queer turns. Consider Eddard Stark, </text>

<text top="647" left="171" width="432" height="15" font="1">“There were damn few as did,” Lord Janos allowed, chuckling. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="610" height="15" font="1">Tyrion chuckled too. “A pity I wasn’t here to see it. They say even Varys was surprised.” </text>

<text top="717" left="139" width="255" height="15" font="1">they say. Well, he didn’t know <i>that</i>.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“How could he?” Tyrion put the first hint of a chill in his tone. “He had helped persuade </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">my sister that Stark should be pardoned, on the condition that he take the black.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">“Eh?” Janos Slynt blinked vaguely at Tyrion. </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My sister Cersei,” Tyrion repeated, a shade more strongly, in case the fool had some </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">doubt who he meant. “The Queen Regent.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” Slynt took a swallow. “As to that, well . . . the king commanded it, m’lord. The </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="101" height="15" font="1">king himself.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="309" height="15" font="1">“The king is thirteen,” Tyrion reminded him. </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Still. He <i>is</i> the king.” Slynt’s jowls quivered when he frowned. “The Lord of the Seven </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">Kingdoms.” </text>
<text top="971" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, one or two of them, at least,” Tyrion said with a sour smile. “Might I have a look </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">at your spear?” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="317" height="15" font="1">“My spear?” Lord Janos blinked in confusion. </text>
<text top="1041" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">Tyrion pointed. “The clasp that fastens your cape.” </text>
<text top="1066" left="171" width="482" height="15" font="1">Hesitantly, Lord Janos drew out the ornament and handed it to Tyrion. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We have goldsmiths in Lannisport who do better work,” he opined. “The red enamel </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood is a shade much, if you don’t mind my saying. Tell me, my lord, did you drive the spear </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="454" height="15" font="1">into the man’s back yourself, or did you only give the command?” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I gave the command, and I’d give it again. Lord Stark was a traitor.” The bald spot in </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the middle of Slynt’s head was beet-red, and his cloth-of-gold cape had slithered off his </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">shoulders onto the floor. “The man tried to buy me.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="339" height="15" font="1">“Little dreaming that you had already been sold.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Slynt slammed down his wine cup. “Are you drunk? If you think I will sit here and have </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What honor is that? I do admit, you made a better bargain than Ser Jacelyn. A lordship </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and a castle for a spear thrust in the back, and you didn’t even need to thrust the spear.” He </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tossed the golden ornament back to Janos Slynt. It bounced off his chest and clattered to the </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">floor as the man rose. </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I mislike the tone of your voice, my lo— Imp. I am the Lord of Harrenhal and a member </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">of the king’s council, who are you to chastise me like this?” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion cocked his head sideways. “I think you know quite well who I am. How many </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">sons do you have?” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“What are my sons to you, dwarf?” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Dwarf?</i>” His anger flashed. “You should have stopped at Imp. I am Tyrion of House </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lannister, and someday, if you have the sense the gods gave a sea slug, you will drop to your </text>

<text top="558" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="5"><i>sons do you have?</i>” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Tyrion could see the sudden fear in Janos Slynt’s eyes. “Th-three, m’lord. And a </text>

<text top="628" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You need not beg.” He slid off his chair. “You have my word, no harm will come to </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them. The younger boys will be fostered out as squires. If they serve well and loyally, they </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">may be knights in time. Let it never be said that House Lannister does not reward those who </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">serve it. Your eldest son will inherit the title Lord Slynt, and this appalling sigil of yours.” He </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">kicked at the little golden spear and sent it skittering across the floor. “Lands will be found for </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him, and he can build a seat for himself. It will not be Harrenhal, but it will be sufficient. It </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="343" height="15" font="1">will be up to him to make a marriage for the girl.” </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Janos Slynt’s face had gone from red to white.  “Wh-what . . . what  do  you . . . ?”  His </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="289" height="15" font="1">jowls were quivering like mounds of suet. </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What do I mean to do with <i>you?</i>” Tyrion let the oaf tremble for a moment before he </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">answered. “The carrack <i>Summer’s Dream</i> sails on the morning tide. Her master tells me she </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">will call at Gulltown, the Three Sisters, the isle of Skagos, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. When </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you see Lord Commander Mormont, give him my fond regards, and tell him that I have not </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">forgotten the needs of the Night’s Watch. I wish you long life and good service, my lord.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Once Janos Slynt realized he was not to be summarily executed, color returned to his </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face. He thrust his jaw out. “We will see about this, Imp. <i>Dwarf.</i> Perhaps it will be you on that </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ship, what do you think of that? Perhaps it will be you on the Wall.” He gave a bark of </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">anxious laughter. “You and your threats, well, we will see. I am the king’s friend, you know. </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this. And Littlefinger and the queen, oh, yes. </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Janos Slynt has a good many friends. We will see who goes sailing, I promise you. Indeed we </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Slynt spun on his heel like the watchman he’d once been, and strode the length of the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Small Hall, boots ringing on the stone. He clattered up the steps, threw open the door . . . and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">came face-to-face with a tall, lantern-jawed man in black breastplate and gold cloak. Strapped </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to the stump of his right wrist was an iron hand. “Janos,” he said, deep-set eyes glinting under </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a prominent brow ridge and a shock of salt-and-pepper hair. Six gold cloaks moved quietly </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">into the Small Hall behind him as Janos Slynt backed away. </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Lord Slynt,” Tyrion called out, “I believe you know Ser Jacelyn Bywater, our new </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="225" height="15" font="1">Commander of the City Watch.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We have a litter waiting for you, my lord,” Ser Jacelyn told Slynt. “The docks are dark </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">and distant, and the streets are not safe by night. Men.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As the gold cloaks ushered out their onetime commander, Tyrion called Ser Jacelyn to </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his side and handed him a roll of parchment. “It’s a long voyage, and Lord Slynt will want for </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">company. See that these six join him on the <i>Summer’s Dream</i>.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="410" height="15" font="1">Bywater glanced over the names and smiled. “As you will.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“There’s one,” Tyrion said quietly. “Deem. Tell the captain it would not be taken amiss if </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">that one should happen to be swept overboard before they reach Eastwatch.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’m told those northern waters are very stormy, my lord.” Ser Jacelyn bowed and took </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="616" height="15" font="1">his leave, his cloak rippling behind him. He trod on Slynt’s cloth-of-gold cape on his way. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tyrion sat alone, sipping at what remained of the fine sweet Dornish wine. Servants </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">came and went, clearing the dishes from the table. He told them to leave the wine. When they </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were done, Varys came gliding into the hall, wearing flowing lavender robes that matched his </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="282" height="15" font="1">smell. “Oh sweetly done, my good lord.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Then why do I have this bitter taste in my mouth?” He pressed his fingers into his </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">temples. “I told them to throw Allar Deem into the sea. I am sorely tempted to do the same </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">with you.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You might be disappointed by the result,” Varys replied. “The storms come and go, the </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">waves crash overhead, the big fish eat the little fish, and I keep on paddling. Might I trouble </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="422" height="15" font="1">you for a taste of the wine that Lord Slynt enjoyed so much?” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">Tyrion waved at the flagon, frowning. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Varys filled a cup. “Ah. Sweet as summer.” He took another sip. “I hear the grapes </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">singing on my tongue.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I wondered what that noise was. Tell the grapes to keep still, my head is about to split. It </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was my sister. That was what the oh-so-loyal Lord Janos refused to say. <i>Cersei</i> sent the gold </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">cloaks to that brothel.” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">Varys tittered nervously. So he had known all along. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="328" height="15" font="1">“You left that part out,” Tyrion said accusingly. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your own sweet sister,” Varys said, so grief-stricken he looked close to tears. “It is a </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">hard thing to tell a man, my lord. I was fearful how you might take it. Can you forgive me?” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No,” Tyrion snapped. “Damn you. Damn <i>her</i>.” He could not touch Cersei, he knew. Not </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">yet, not even if he’d wanted to, and he was far from certain that he did. Yet it rankled, to sit </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">here and make a mummer’s show of justice by punishing the sorry likes of Janos Slynt and </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Allar Deem, while his sister continued on her savage course. “In future, you will tell me what </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">you know, Lord Varys. <i>All</i> of what you know.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The eunuch’s smile was sly. “That might take rather a long time, my good lord. I know </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">quite a lot.” </text>
</page>
<page number="70" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">“Not enough to save this child, it would seem.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Alas, no. There was another bastard, a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">harm’s way . . . but I confess, I never dreamed the babe would be at risk. A baseborn girl, less </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="496" height="15" font="1">than a year old, with a whore for a mother. What threat could she pose?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="595" height="15" font="1">“She was Robert’s,” Tyrion said bitterly. “That was enough for Cersei, it would seem.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes. It is grievous sad. I must blame myself for the poor sweet babe and her mother, </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">who was so young and loved the king.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Did she?” Tyrion had never seen the dead girl’s face, but in his mind she was Shae and </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Tysha both. “Can a whore truly love anyone, I wonder? No, don’t answer. Some things I </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would rather not know.” He had settled Shae in a sprawling stone-and-timber manse, with its </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">own well and stable and garden; he had given her servants to see to her wants, a white bird </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">from the Summer Isles to keep her company, silks and silver and gemstones to adorn her, </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">guards to protect her. And yet she seemed restive. She wanted to be with him more, she told </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him; she wanted to serve him and help him. “You help me most here, between the sheets,” he </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">told her one night after their loving as he lay beside her, his head pillowed against her breast, </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his groin aching with a sweet soreness. She made no reply, save with her eyes. He could see </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">there that it was not what she’d wanted to hear. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sighing, Tyrion started to reach for the wine again, then remembered Lord Janos and </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pushed the flagon away. “It does seem my sister was telling the truth about Stark’s death. We </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">have my nephew to thank for that madness.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“King Joffrey gave the command. Janos Slynt and Ser Ilyn Payne carried it out, swiftly, </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">without hesitation . . .” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“. . . almost as if they had expected it. Yes, we have been over this ground before, </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">without profit. A folly.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“With the City Watch in hand, my lord, you are well placed to see to it that His Grace </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">commits no further . . . follies? To be sure, there is still the queen’s household guard to </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">consider . . .” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“The red cloaks?” Tyrion shrugged. “Vylarr’s loyalty is to Casterly Rock. He knows I am </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="652" height="15" font="1">here with my father’s authority. Cersei would find it hard to use his men against </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">me . . . besides, they are only a hundred. I have half again as many men of my own. <i>And</i> six </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="385" height="15" font="1">thousand gold cloaks, if Bywater is the man you claim.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="607" height="15" font="1">“You will find Ser Jacelyn to be courageous, honorable, obedient . . . and most grateful.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“To whom, I wonder?” Tyrion did not trust Varys, though there was no denying his </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">value. He knew things, beyond a doubt. “Why <i>are</i> you so helpful, my lord Varys?” he asked, </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="524" height="15" font="1">studying the man’s soft hands, the bald powdered face, the slimy little smile. </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“You are the Hand. I serve the realm, the king, and you.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“As you served Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark?” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I served Lord Arryn and Lord Stark as best I could. I was saddened and horrified by </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="196" height="15" font="1">their most untimely deaths.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="270" height="15" font="1">“Think how <i>I</i> feel. I’m like to be next.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Oh, I think not,” Varys said, swirling the wine in his cup. “Power is a curious thing, my </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="547" height="15" font="1">lord. Perchance you have considered the riddle I posed you that day in the inn?” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It has crossed my mind a time or two,” Tyrion admitted. “The king, the priest, the rich </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">man—who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It’s a riddle without an </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“That piece of steel is the power of life and death.” </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other </text>

<text top="424" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion cocked his head sideways. “Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only </text>

<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys smiled. “Here, then. Power resides where men <i>believe</i> it resides. No more and no </text>

<text top="583" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Tyrion smiled. “Lord Varys, I am growing strangely fond of you. I may kill you yet, but I </text>

<text top="653" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">“What are you, Varys?” Tyrion found he truly wanted to know. “A spider, they say.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="594" height="15" font="1">“Spies and informers are seldom loved, my lord. I am but a loyal servant of the realm.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys made a mark on the parchment. “Ser Horas and Ser Hobber Redwyne have bribed </text>

<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The eunuch gave a nervous giggle and made another mark. “We also have a sudden </text>

<text top="514" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shrugged. “We are close on the three hundredth year since Aegon’s Landing, I </text>

<text top="781" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">When the eunuch had departed, Tyrion sat for a long time watching the candle and </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wondering how his sister would take the news of Janos Slynt’s dismissal. Not happily, if he </text>

<text top="804" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crowded close to slow shallow streams. Even so, the path was so narrow and crooked that </text>

<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was the wagons that slowed them, lumbering along, axles creaking under the weight of </text>
<text top="868" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their heavy loads. A dozen times a day they had to stop to free a wheel that had stuck in a rut, </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">or double up the teams to climb a muddy slope. Once, in the middle of a dense stand of oak, </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they came face-to-face with three men pulling a load of firewood in an ox cart, with no way </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for either to get around. There had been nothing for it but to wait while the foresters unhitched </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their ox, led him through the trees, spun the cart, hitched the ox up again, and started back the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were lost. When she was being quiet as a shadow, she could sneak past all of them, flitting out </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">by starlight to make her water in the woods where no one would see. Once, when Lommy </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Greenhands had the watch, she shimmied up an oak and moved from tree to tree until she was </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">right above his head, and he never saw a thing. She would have jumped down on top of him, </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but she knew his scream would wake the whole camp, and Yoren might take a stick to her </text>

<text top="227" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lommy and the other orphans all treated the Bull like someone special now because the </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">queen wanted his head, though he would have none of it. “I never did nothing to no queen,” </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he said angrily. “I did my work, is all. Bellows and tongs and fetch and carry. I was s’posed to </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">be an armorer, and one day Master Mott says I got to join the Night’s Watch, that’s all I </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">know.” Then he’d go off to polish his helm. It was a beautiful helm, rounded and curved, with </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a slit visor and two great metal bull’s horns. Arya would watch him polish the metal with an </text>

<text top="363" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">he never actually put it on his head. </text>
<text top="388" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I bet he’s that traitor’s bastard,” Lommy said one night, in a hushed voice so Gendry </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="488" height="15" font="1">would not hear. “The wolf lord, the one they nicked on Baelor’s steps.” </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He is not,” Arya declared. <i>My father only had one bastard, and that’s Jon.</i> She stalked </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">off into the trees, wishing she could just saddle her horse and ride home. She was a good </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horse, a chestnut mare with a white blaze on her forehead. And Arya had always been a good </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rider. She could gallop off and never see any of them, unless she wanted to. Only then she’d </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">have no one to scout ahead of her, or watch behind, or stand guard while she napped, and </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when the gold cloaks caught her, she’d be all alone. It was safer to stay with Yoren and the </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">others. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We’re not far from Gods Eye,” the black brother said one morning. “The kingsroad </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">won’t be safe till we’re across the Trident. So we’ll come up around the lake along the </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">western shore, they’re not like to look for us there.” At the next spot where two ruts cut cross </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="267" height="15" font="1">each other, he turned the wagons west. </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Here farmland gave way to forest, the villages and holdfasts were smaller and farther </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">apart, the hills higher and the valleys deeper. Food grew harder to come by. In the city, Yoren </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had loaded up the wagons with salt fish, hard bread, lard, turnips, sacks of beans and barley, </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and wheels of yellow cheese, but every bite of it had been eaten. Forced to live off the land, </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Yoren turned to Koss and Kurz, who’d been taken as poachers. He would send them ahead of </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the column, into the woods, and come dusk they would be back with a deer slung between </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them on a pole or a brace of quail swinging from their belts. The younger boys would be set </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to picking blackberries along the road, or climbing fences to fill a sack with apples if they </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">happened upon an orchard. </text>
<text top="839" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya was a skilled climber and a fast picker, and she liked to go off by herself. One day </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she came across a rabbit, purely by happenstance. It was brown and fat, with long ears and a </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">twitchy nose. Rabbits ran faster than cats, but they couldn’t climb trees half so well. She </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">whacked it with her stick and grabbed it by its ears, and Yoren stewed it with some </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mushrooms and wild onions. Arya was given a whole leg, since it was her rabbit. She shared </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">it with Gendry. The rest of them each got a spoonful, even the three in manacles. Jaqen </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">H’ghar thanked her politely for the treat, and Biter licked the grease off his dirty fingers with </text>
<text top="975" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a blissful look, but Rorge, the noseless one, only laughed and said, “There’s a hunter now. </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">Lumpyface Lumpyhead Rabbitkiller.” </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Outside a holdfast called Briarwhite, some field hands surrounded them in a cornfield, </text>
<text top="1039" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">demanding coin for the ears they’d taken. Yoren eyed their scythes and tossed them a few </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">coppers. “Time was, a man in black was feasted from Dorne to Winterfell, and even high </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lords called it an honor to shelter him under their roofs,” he said bitterly. “Now cravens like </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="383" height="15" font="1">you want hard coin for a bite of wormy apple.” He spat. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“It’s sweetcorn, better’n a stinking old black bird like you deserves,” one of them </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">answered roughly. “You get out of our field now, and take these sneaks and stabbers with </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">you, or we’ll stake you up in the corn to scare the other crows away.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They roasted the sweetcorn in the husk that night, turning the ears with long forked </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sticks, and ate it hot right off the cob. Arya thought it tasted wonderful, but Yoren was too </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">angry to eat. A cloud seemed to hang over him, ragged and black as his cloak. He paced about </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">the camp restlessly, muttering to himself. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The next day Koss came racing back to warn Yoren of a camp ahead. “Twenty or thirty </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">men, in mail and half-helms,” he said. “Some of them are cut up bad, and one’s dying, from </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the sound of him. With all the noise he was making, I got right up close. They got spears and </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shields, but only one horse, and that’s lame. I think they been there awhile, from the stink of </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="77" height="15" font="1">the place.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="113" height="15" font="1">“See a banner?” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="405" height="15" font="1">“Spotted treecat, yellow and black, on a mud-brown field.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yoren folded a sourleaf into his mouth and chewed. “Can’t say,” he admitted. “Might be </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one side, might be t’other. If they’re hurt that bad, likely they’d take our mounts no matter </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">who they are. Might be they’d take more than that. I believe we’ll go wide around them.” It </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">took them miles out of their way, and cost them two days at the least, but the old man said it </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was cheap at the price. “You’ll have time enough on the Wall. The rest o’ your lives, most </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">like. Seems to me there’s no rush to get there.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya saw men guarding the fields more and more when they turned north again. Often </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they stood silently beside the road, giving a cold eye to anyone who passed. Elsewhere they </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">patrolled on horses, riding their fence lines with axes strapped to their saddles. At one place, </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she spotted a man perched up in a dead tree, with a bow in his hand and a quiver hanging </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">from the branch beside him. The moment he spied them, he notched an arrow to his </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bowstring, and never looked away until the last wagon was out of sight. All the while, Yoren </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cursed. “Him in his tree, let’s see how well he likes it up there when the Others come to take </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="353" height="15" font="1">him. He’ll scream for the Watch then, that he will.” </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A day later Dobber spied a red glow against the evening sky. “Either this road went and </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">turned again, or that sun’s setting in the north.” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yoren climbed a rise to get a better look. “Fire,” he announced. He licked a thumb and </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">held it up. “Wind should blow it away from us. Still bears watching.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">And watch it they did. As the world darkened, the fire seemed to grow brighter and </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brighter, until it looked as though the whole north was ablaze. From time to time, they could </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">even smell the smoke, though the wind held steady and the flames never got any closer. By </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="538" height="15" font="1">dawn the fire had burned itself out, but none of them slept very well that night. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was midday when they arrived at the place where the village had been. The fields were </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a charred desolation for miles around, the houses blackened shells. The carcasses of burnt and </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">butchered animals dotted the ground, under living blankets of carrion crows that rose, cawing </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">furiously, when disturbed. Smoke still drifted from inside the holdfast. Its timber palisade </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="405" height="15" font="1">looked strong from afar, but had not proved strong enough. </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Riding out in front of the wagons on her horse, Arya saw burnt bodies impaled on </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sharpened stakes atop the walls, their hands drawn up tight in front of their faces as if to fight </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">off the flames that had consumed them. Yoren called a halt when they were still some </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">distance off, and told Arya and the other boys to guard the wagons while he and Murch and </text>
</page>
<page number="76" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Cutjack went in on foot. A flock of ravens rose from inside the walls when they climbed </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through the broken gate, and the caged ravens in their wagons called out to them with quorks </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">and raucous shrieks. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Should we go in after them?” Arya asked Gendry after Yoren and the others had been </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="122" height="15" font="1">gone a long time. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yoren said wait.” Gendry’s voice sounded hollow. When Arya turned to look, she saw </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">that he was wearing his helm, all shiny steel and great curving horns. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When they finally returned, Yoren had a little girl in his arms, and Murch and Cutjack </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were carrying a woman in a sling made of an old torn quilt. The girl was no older than two </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and she cried all the time, a whimpery sound, like something was caught in her throat. Either </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she couldn’t talk yet or she had forgotten how. The woman’s right arm ended in a bloody </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stump at her elbow, and her eyes didn’t seem to see anything, even when she was looking </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">right at it. She talked, but she only said one thing. “Please,” she cried, over and over. “Please. </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Please.” Rorge thought that was funny. He laughed through the hole in his face where his </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nose had been, and Biter started laughing too, until Murch cursed them and told them to shut </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="25" height="15" font="1">up. </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yoren had them fix the woman a place in the back of a wagon. “And be quick about it,” </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="395" height="15" font="1">he said. “Come dark, there’ll be wolves here, and worse.” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’m scared,” Hot Pie murmured when he saw the one-armed woman thrashing in the </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="54" height="15" font="1">wagon. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="185" height="15" font="1">“Me too,” Arya confessed. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He squeezed her shoulder. “I never truly kicked no boy to death, Arry. I just sold my </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">mommy’s pies, is all.” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya rode as far ahead of the wagons as she dared, so she wouldn’t have to hear the little </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">girl crying or listen to the woman whisper, “Please.” She remembered a story Old Nan had </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">told once, about a man imprisoned in a dark castle by evil giants. He was very brave and </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smart and he tricked the giants and escaped . . . but no sooner was he outside the castle than </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="601" height="15" font="1">the Others took him, and drank his hot red blood. Now she knew how he must have felt. </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The one-armed woman died at evenfall. Gendry and Cutjack dug her grave on a hillside </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beneath a weeping willow. When the wind blew, Arya thought she could hear the long trailing </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">branches whispering, “Please. Please. Please.” The little hairs on the back of her neck rose, </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="266" height="15" font="1">and she almost ran from the graveside. </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No fire tonight,” Yoren told them. Supper was a handful of wild radishes Koss found, a </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cup of dry beans, water from a nearby brook. The water had a funny taste to it, and Lommy </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">told them it was the taste of bodies, rotting someplace upstream. Hot Pie would have hit him </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="269" height="15" font="1">if old Reysen hadn’t pulled them apart. </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya drank too much water, just to fill her belly with something. She never thought she’d </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">be able to sleep, yet somehow she did. When she woke, it was pitch-black and her bladder </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was full to bursting. Sleepers huddled all around her, wrapped in blankets and cloaks. Arya </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">found Needle, stood, listened. She heard the soft footfalls of a sentry, men turning in restless </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sleep, Rorge’s rattling snores, and the queer hissing sound that Biter made when he slept. </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">From a different wagon came the steady rhythmic scrape of steel on stone as Yoren sat, </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">chewing sourleaf and sharpening the edge of his dirk. </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie was one of the boys on watch. “Where you going?” he asked when he saw Arya </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">heading for the trees. </text>
<text top="1054" left="171" width="238" height="15" font="1">Arya waved vaguely at the woods. </text>
</page>
<page number="77" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“No you’re not,” Hot Pie said. He had gotten bolder again now that he had a sword on his </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">belt, even though it was just a shortsword and he handled it like a cleaver. “The old man said </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">for everyone to stay close tonight.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">“I need to make water,” Arya explained. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, use that tree right there.” He pointed. “You don’t know what’s out there, Arry. I </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">heard wolves before.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Yoren wouldn’t like it if she fought with him. She tried to look afraid. “Wolves? For </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">true?” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">“I heard,” he assured her. </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I don’t think I need to go after all.” She went back to her blanket and pretended to sleep </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">until she heard Hot Pie’s footsteps going away. Then she rolled over and slipped off into the </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">woods on the other side of the camp, quiet as a shadow. There were sentries out this way too, </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but Arya had no trouble avoiding them. Just to make sure, she went out twice as far as usual. </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">When she was sure there was no one near, she skinned down her breeches and squatted to do </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="92" height="15" font="1">her business. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She was making water, her clothing tangled about her ankles, when she heard rustling </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from under the trees. <i>Hot Pie</i>, she thought in panic, <i>he followed me.</i> Then she saw the eyes </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shining out from the wood, bright with reflected moonlight. Her belly clenched tight as she </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grabbed for Needle, not caring if she pissed herself, counting eyes, two four eight twelve, a </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">whole pack . . . </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One of them came padding out from under the trees. He stared at her, and bared his teeth, </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and all she could think was how stupid she’d been and how Hot Pie would gloat when they </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">found her half-eaten body the next morning. But the wolf turned and raced back into the </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">darkness, and quick as that the eyes were gone. Trembling, she cleaned herself and laced up </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and followed a distant scraping sound back to camp, and to Yoren. Arya climbed up into the </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">wagon beside him, shaken. “Wolves,” she whispered hoarsely. “In the woods.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">“Aye. They would be.” He never looked at her. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="131" height="15" font="1">“They scared me.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="461" height="15" font="1">“Did they?” He spat. “Seems to me your kind was fond o’ wolves.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Nymeria was a direwolf.” Arya hugged herself. “That’s different. Anyhow, she’s gone. </text>

<text top="308" left="171" width="403" height="15" font="1">The morning air was dark with the smoke of burning gods. </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They were all afire now, Maid and Mother, Warrior and Smith, the Crone with her pearl </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eyes and the Father with his gilded beard; even the Stranger, carved to look more animal than </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">human. The old dry wood and countless layers of paint and varnish blazed with a fierce </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hungry light. Heat rose shimmering through the chill air; behind, the gargoyles and stone </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dragons on the castle walls seemed blurred, as if Davos were seeing them through a veil of </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">tears. <i>Or as if the beasts were trembling, stirring . . .</i> </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“An ill thing,” Allard declared, though at least he had the sense to keep his voice low. </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="180" height="15" font="1">Dale muttered agreement. </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Silence,” said Davos. “Remember where you are.” His sons were good men, but young, </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and Allard especially was rash. <i>Had I stayed a smuggler, Allard would have ended on the </i></text>

<text top="564" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hundreds had come to the castle gates to bear witness to the burning of the Seven. The </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smell in the air was ugly. Even for soldiers, it was hard not to feel uneasy at such an affront to </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="299" height="15" font="1">the gods most had worshiped all their lives. </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The red woman walked round the fire three times, praying once in the speech of Asshai, </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">once in High Valyrian, and once in the Common Tongue. Davos understood only the last. </text>

<text top="706" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the night is dark and full of terrors.” Queen Selyse echoed the words. Beside her, Stannis </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watched impassively, his jaw hard as stone under the blue-black shadow of his tight-cropped </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">beard. He had dressed more richly than was his wont, as if for the sept. </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dragonstone’s sept had been where Aegon the Conqueror knelt to pray the night before </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he sailed. That had not saved it from the queen’s men. They had overturned the altars, pulled </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">down the statues, and smashed the stained glass with warhammers. Septon Barre could only </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">curse them, but Ser Hubard Rambton led his three sons to the sept to defend their gods. The </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Rambtons had slain four of the queen’s men before the others overwhelmed them. Afterward </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Guncer Sunglass, mildest and most pious of lords, told Stannis he could no longer support his </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">claim. Now he shared a sweltering cell with the septon and Ser Hubard’s two surviving sons. </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">The other lords had not been slow to take the lesson. </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The gods had never meant much to Davos the smuggler, though like most men he had </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been known to make offerings to the Warrior before battle, to the Smith when he launched a </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ship, and to the Mother whenever his wife grew great with child. He felt ill as he watched </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="1">them burn, and not only from the smoke. </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Maester Cressen would have stopped this.</i> The old man had challenged the Lord of Light </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and been struck down for his impiety, or so the gossips told each other. Davos knew the truth. </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The burning gods cast a pretty light, wreathed in their robes of shifting flame, red and </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">orange and yellow. Septon Barre had once told Davos how they’d been carved from the masts </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the ships that had carried the first Targaryens from Valyria. Over the centuries, they had </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">been painted and repainted, gilded, silvered, jeweled. “Their beauty will make them more </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pleasing to R’hllor,” Melisandre said when she told Stannis to pull them down and drag them </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">out the castle gates. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The Maiden lay athwart the Warrior, her arms widespread as if to embrace him. The </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mother seemed almost to shudder as the flames came licking up her face. A longsword had </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been thrust through her heart, and its leather grip was alive with flame. The Father was on the </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bottom, the first to fall. Davos watched the hand of the Stranger writhe and curl as the fingers </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blackened and fell away one by one, reduced to so much glowing charcoal. Nearby, Lord </text>

<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">red crabs. The Myrmen swapped jokes as they enjoyed the warmth of the fire, but young Lord </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bar Emmon had turned a splotchy grey, and Lord Velaryon was watching the king rather than </text>

<text top="491" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Davos would have given much to know what he was thinking, but one such as Velaryon </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would never confide in him. The Lord of the Tides was of the blood of ancient Valyria, and </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his House had thrice provided brides for Targaryen princes; Davos Seaworth stank of fish and </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">onions. It was the same with the other lordlings. He could trust none of them, nor would they </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ever include him in their private councils. They scorned his sons as well. <i>My grandsons will </i></text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>joust with theirs, though, and one day their blood may wed with mine. In time my little black </i></text>

<text top="633" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">That is, if Stannis won his throne. If he lost . . . </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Everything I am, I owe to him.</i> Stannis had raised him to knighthood. He had given him a </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">place of honor at his table, a war galley to sail in place of a smuggler’s skiff. Dale and Allard </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">captained galleys as well, Maric was oarmaster on the <i>Fury</i>, Matthos served his father on </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Black Betha</i>, and the king had taken Devan as a royal squire. One day he would be knighted, </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and the two little lads as well. Marya was mistress of a small keep on Cape Wrath, with </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">servants who called her <i>m’lady</i>, and Davos could hunt red deer in his own woods. All this he </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had of Stannis Baratheon, for the price of a few finger joints. <i>It was just, what he did to me. I </i></text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>had flouted the king’s laws all my life. He has earned my loyalty.</i> Davos touched the little </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">pouch that hung from the leather thong about his neck. His fingers were his luck, and he </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">needed luck now. <i>As do we all. Lord Stannis most of all.</i> </text>
<text top="858" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Pale flames licked at the grey sky. Dark smoke rose, twisting and curling. When the wind </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pushed it toward them, men blinked and wept and rubbed their eyes. Allard turned his head </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">away, coughing and cursing. <i>A taste of things to come</i>, thought Davos. Many and more would </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">burn before this war was done. </text>
<text top="942" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Melisandre was robed all in scarlet satin and blood velvet, her eyes as red as the great </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ruby that glistened at her throat as if it too were afire. “In ancient books of Asshai it is written </text>

<text top="1039" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.” She lifted </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">her voice, so it carried out over the gathered host. “<i>Azor Ahai, beloved of R’hllor! The </i></text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis Baratheon strode forward like a soldier marching into battle. His squires stepped </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up to attend him. Davos watched as his son Devan pulled a long padded glove over the king’s </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">right hand. The boy wore a cream-colored doublet with a fiery heart sewn on the breast. </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Bryen Farring was similarly garbed as he tied a stiff leather cape around His Grace’s neck. </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Behind, Davos heard a faint clank and clatter of bells. “Under the sea, smoke rises in bubbles, </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and flames burn green and blue and black,” Patchface sang somewhere. “I know, I know, oh, </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">oh, oh.” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The king plunged into the fire with his teeth clenched, holding the leather cloak before </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him to keep off the flames. He went straight to the Mother, grasped the sword with his gloved </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">hand, and wrenched it free of the burning wood with a single hard jerk. Then he was </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">retreating, the sword held high, jade-green flames swirling around cherry-red steel. Guards </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">rushed to beat out the cinders that clung to the king’s clothing. </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>A sword of fire!</i>” shouted Queen Selyse. Ser Axell Florent and the other queen’s men </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">took up the cry. “<i>A sword of fire! It burns! It burns! A sword of fire!</i>” </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Melisandre lifted her hands above her head. “<i>Behold! A sign was promised, and now a </i></text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>sign is seen! Behold Lightbringer! Azor Ahai has come again! All hail the Warrior of Light! </i></text>

<text top="502" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A ragged wave of shouts gave answer, just as Stannis’s glove began to smolder. Cursing, </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the king thrust the point of the sword into the damp earth and beat out the flames against his </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="29" height="15" font="1">leg. </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="376" height="15" font="1">“Lord, cast your light upon us!” Melisandre called out. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“For the night is dark and full of terrors,” Selyse and her queen’s men replied. <i>Should I </i></text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>speak the words as well?</i> Davos wondered. <i>Do I owe Stannis that much? Is this fiery god truly </i></text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="5"><i>his own?</i> His shortened fingers twitched. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Stannis peeled off the glove and let it fall to the ground. The gods in the pyre were </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">scarcely recognizable anymore. The head fell off the Smith with a puff of ash and embers. </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Melisandre sang in the tongue of Asshai, her voice rising and falling like the tides of the sea. </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">Stannis untied his singed leather cape and listened in silence. Thrust in the ground, </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lightbringer still glowed ruddy hot, but the flames that clung to the sword were dwindling </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">and dying. </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">By the time the song was done, only charwood remained of the gods, and the king’s </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">patience had run its course. He took the queen by the elbow and escorted her back into </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Dragonstone, leaving Lightbringer where it stood. The red woman remained a moment to </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watch as Devan knelt with Bryen Farring and rolled up the burnt and blackened sword in the </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">king’s leather cloak. <i>The Red Sword of Heroes looks a proper mess</i>, thought Davos. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A few of the lords lingered to speak in quiet voices upwind of the fire. They fell silent </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">when they saw Davos looking at them. <i>Should Stannis fall, they will pull me down in an </i></text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="375" height="15" font="1">“A lord can choose more than one badge,” Davos said. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">Dale smiled. “A black ship <i>and</i> an onion, Father?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Allard kicked at a stone. “The Others take our onion . . . <i>and</i> that flaming heart. It was an </text>

<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When did you grow so devout?” Davos said. “What does a smuggler’s son know of the </text>

<text top="288" left="171" width="489" height="15" font="1">“I’m a knight’s son, Father. If you won’t remember, why should they?” </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A knight’s son, but not a knight,” said Davos. “Nor will you ever be, if you meddle in </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">affairs that do not concern you. Stannis is our rightful king, it is not for us to question him. </text>

<text top="467" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I will speak to the king about it,” Davos promised. Better it come from him than from </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Allard. His sons were good fighters and better sailors, but they did not know how to talk to </text>

<text top="608" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">whore . . . a vain search, since Stannis permitted none on his island. Ships lined the strand; </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">war galleys and fishing vessels, stout carracks and fat-bottomed cogs. The best berths had </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">been taken by the largest vessels: Stannis’s flagship <i>Fury</i> rocking between <i>Lord Steffon</i> and </text>

<text top="750" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A weathered little inn sat on the end of the stone pier where <i>Black Betha</i>,  <i>Wraith</i>, and </text>

<text top="809" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">front squatted a waist-high gargoyle, so eroded by rain and salt that his features were all but </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">obliterated. He and Davos were old friends, though. He gave a pat to the stone head as he </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">went in. “Luck,” he murmured. </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Across the noisy common room, Salladhor Saan sat eating grapes from a wooden bowl. </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">When he spied Davos, he beckoned him closer. “Ser knight, come sit with me. Eat a grape. </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">Eat two. They are marvelously sweet.” The Lyseni was a sleek, smiling man whose </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">flamboyance was a byword on both sides of the narrow sea. Today he wore flashing cloth-of-</text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">silver, with dagged sleeves so long the ends of them pooled on the floor. His buttons were </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">carved jade monkeys, and atop his wispy white curls perched a jaunty green cap decorated </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">with a fan of peacock feathers. </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Davos threaded his way through the tables to a chair. In the days before his knighthood, </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he had often bought cargoes from Salladhor Saan. The Lyseni was a smuggler himself, as well </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“You did not see the gods burn, my lord?” he asked. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The red priests have a great temple on Lys. Always they are burning this and burning </text>

<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stannis too, it is to be hoped.” He seemed utterly unconcerned that someone might overhear </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him, eating his grapes and dribbling the seeds out onto his lip, flicking them off with a finger. </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“My <i>Bird of a Thousand Colors</i> came in yesterday, good ser. She is not a warship, no, but a </text>

<text top="291" left="139" width="618" height="15" font="1">Children go hungry in the city, it is said.” He dangled the grapes before Davos and smiled. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="188" height="15" font="1">“It’s ale I need, and news.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“The men of Westeros are ever rushing,” complained Salladhor Saan. “What good is this, </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">I ask you? He who hurries through life hurries to his grave.” He belched. “The Lord of </text>

<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">on the battlements, who can say? The dwarf has chased off the lout who ruled the gold cloaks </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and put in his place a knight with an iron hand.” He plucked a grape, and squeezed it between </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">thumb and forefinger until the skin burst. Juice ran down between his fingers. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A serving girl pushed her way through, swatting at the hands that groped her as she </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">passed. Davos ordered a tankard of ale, turned back to Saan, and said, “How well is the city </text>

<text top="547" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The other shrugged. “The walls are high and strong, but who will man them? They are </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">building scorpions and spitfires, oh, yes, but the men in the golden cloaks are too few and too </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">green, and there are no others. A swift strike, like a hawk plummeting at a hare, and the great </text>

<text top="708" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Pirate,” said Davos. “You have no wives, only concubines, and you have been well paid </text>

<text top="753" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Only in promises,” said Salladhor Saan mournfully. “Good ser, it is gold I crave, not </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">words on papers.” He popped a grape into his mouth. </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You’ll have your gold when we take the treasury in King’s Landing. No man in the </text>

<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Davos spoke, he thought, <i>This world is twisted beyond hope, when lowborn smugglers must </i></text>

<text top="926" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The serving girl returned with his ale. Davos gave her a copper. “Might be we could take </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">King’s Landing, as you say,” he said as he lifted the tankard, “but how long would we hold it? </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">Tywin Lannister is known to be at Harrenhal with a great host, and Lord Renly . . .” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ah, yes, the young brother,” said Salladhor Saan. “That part is not so good, my friend. </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">The sudden shift in subject left Davos uneasy. “Sword?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A sword plucked from fire, yes. Men tell me things, it is my pleasant smile. How shall a </text>

<text top="372" left="171" width="258" height="15" font="1">“A <i>burning</i> sword,” corrected Davos. </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Burnt,” said Salladhor Saan, “and be glad of that, my friend. Do you know the tale of </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the forging of Lightbringer? I shall tell it to you. It was a time when darkness lay heavy on the </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">world. To oppose it, the hero must have a hero’s blade, oh, like none that had ever been. And </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">so for thirty days and thirty nights Azor Ahai labored sleepless in the temple, forging a blade </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in the sacred fires. Heat and hammer and fold, heat and hammer and fold, oh, yes, until the </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">sword was done. Yet when he plunged it into water to temper the steel it burst asunder.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Being a hero, it was not for him to shrug and go in search of excellent grapes such as </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">these, so again he began. The second time it took him fifty days and fifty nights, and this </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sword seemed even finer than the first. Azor Ahai captured a lion, to temper the blade by </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">plunging it through the beast’s red heart, but once more the steel shattered and split. Great </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="510" height="15" font="1">was his woe and great was his sorrow then, for he knew what he must do.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A hundred days and a hundred nights he labored on the third blade, and as it glowed </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">white-hot in the sacred fires, he summoned his wife. ‘Nissa Nissa’ he said to her, for that was </text>

<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">this thing, why I cannot say, and Azor Ahai thrust the smoking sword through her living heart. </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">It is said that her cry of anguish and ecstasy left a crack across the face of the moon, but her </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood and her soul and her strength and her courage all went into the steel. Such is the tale of </text>

<text top="764" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Now do you see my meaning? Be glad that it is just a burnt sword that His Grace pulled </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from that fire. Too much light can hurt the eyes, my friend, and fire <i>burns</i>.” Salladhor Saan </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">finished the last grape and smacked his lips. “When do you think the king will bid us sail, </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Davos Seaworth lingered over his tankard for a good while, thinking. A year ago, he </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">had been with Stannis in King’s Landing when King Robert staged a tourney for Prince </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Joffrey’s name day. He remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr, and the flaming sword he </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had wielded in the melee. The man had made for a colorful spectacle, his red robes flapping </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">while his blade writhed with pale green flames, but everyone knew there was no true magic to </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">it, and in the end his fire had guttered out and Bronze Yohn Royce had brained him with a </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">common mace. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>A true sword of fire, now, that would be a wonder to behold. Yet at such a cost . . .</i> When </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he thought of Nissa Nissa, it was his own Marya he pictured, a good-natured plump woman </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with sagging breasts and a kindly smile, the best woman in the world. He tried to picture </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself driving a sword through her, and shuddered. <i>I am not made of the stuff of heroes</i>, he </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">decided. If that was the price of a magic sword, it was more than he cared to pay. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Davos finished his ale, pushed away the tankard, and left the inn. On the way out he </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">patted the gargoyle on the head and muttered, “Luck.” They would all need it. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was well after dark when Devan came down to <i>Black Betha</i>, leading a snow-white </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">palfrey. “My lord father,” he announced, “His Grace commands you to attend him in the </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">Chamber of the Painted Table. You are to ride the horse and come at once.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was good to see Devan looking so splendid in his squire’s raiment, but the summons </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">made Davos uneasy. <i>Will he bid us sail?</i> he wondered. Salladhor Saan was not the only </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">captain who felt that King’s Landing was ripe for an attack, but a smuggler must learn </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">patience. <i>We have no hope of victory. I said as much to Maester Cressen, the day I returned to </i></text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>Dragonstone, and nothing has changed. We are too few, the foes too many. If we dip our oars, </i></text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="327" height="15" font="5"><i>we die.</i> Nonetheless, he climbed onto the horse. </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When Davos arrived at the Stone Drum, a dozen highborn knights and great bannermen </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">were just leaving. Lords Celtigar and Velaryon each gave him a curt nod and walked on while </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">the others ignored him utterly, but Ser Axell Florent stopped for a word. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Queen Selyse’s uncle was a keg of a man with thick arms and bandy legs. He had the </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">prominent ears of a Florent, even larger than his niece’s. The coarse hair that sprouted from </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his did not stop him hearing most of what went on in the castle. For ten years Ser Axell had </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">served as castellan of Dragonstone while Stannis sat on Robert’s council in King’s Landing, </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but of late he had emerged as the foremost of the queen’s men. “Ser Davos, it is good to see </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">you, as ever,” he said. </text>
<text top="850" left="171" width="144" height="15" font="1">“And you, my lord.” </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I made note of you this morning as well. The false gods burned with a merry light, did </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">they not?” </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They burned brightly.” Davos did not trust this man, for all his courtesy. House Florent </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">had declared for Renly. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The Lady Melisandre tells us that sometimes R’hllor permits his faithful servants to </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">glimpse the future in flames. It seemed to me as I watched the fire this morning that I was </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">looking at a dozen beautiful dancers, maidens garbed in yellow silk spinning and swirling </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before a great king. I think it was a true vision, ser. A glimpse of the glory that awaits His </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>Stannis has no taste for such dancing</i>, Davos thought, but he dared not offend the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">queen’s uncle. “I saw only fire,” he said, “but the smoke was making my eyes water. You </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">must pardon me, ser, the king awaits.” He pushed past, wondering why Ser Axell had troubled </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="341" height="15" font="1">himself. <i>He is a queen’s man and I am the king’s.</i> </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Stannis sat at his Painted Table with Maester Pylos at his shoulder, an untidy pile of </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">papers before them. “Ser,” the king said when Davos entered, “come have a look at this </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">letter.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Obediently, he selected a paper at random. “It looks handsome enough, Your Grace, but I </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fear I cannot read the words.” Davos could decipher maps and charts as well as any, but </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">letters and other writings were beyond his powers. <i>But my Devan has learned his letters, and </i></text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="5"><i>young Steffon and Stannis as well.</i> </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’d forgotten.” A furrow of irritation showed between the king’s brows. “Pylos, read it </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">to him.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace.” The maester took up one of the parchments and cleared his throat. “<i>All </i></text>

<text top="555" left="139" width="319" height="15" font="1">parchment rustled softly as Pylos laid it down. </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Make it <i>Ser</i> Jaime the Kingslayer henceforth,” Stannis said, frowning. “Whatever else </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the man may be, he remains a knight. I don’t know that we ought to call Robert my <i>beloved</i> </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">brother either. He loved me no more than he had to, nor I him.” </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="327" height="15" font="1">“A harmless courtesy, Your Grace,” Pylos said. </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A lie. Take it out.” Stannis turned to Davos. “The maester tells me that we have one </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hundred seventeen ravens on hand. I mean to use them all. One hundred seventeen ravens will </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to the Wall. Perhaps a hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow. If so, a </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="653" height="15" font="1">hundred maesters will read my words to as many lords in as many solars and </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bedchambers . . . and then the letters will like as not be consigned to the fire, and lips pledged </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">to silence. These great lords love Joffrey, or Renly, or Robb Stark. I am their rightful king, but </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="370" height="15" font="1">they will deny me if they can. So I have need of you.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="310" height="15" font="1">“I am yours to command, my king. As ever.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis nodded. “I mean for you to sail <i>Black Betha</i> north, to Gulltown, the Fingers, the </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Three Sisters, even White Harbor. Your son Dale will go south in <i>Wraith</i>, past Cape Wrath </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and the Broken Arm, all along the coast of Dorne as far as the Arbor. Each of you will carry a </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chest of letters, and you will deliver one to every port and holdfast and fishing village. Nail </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="463" height="15" font="1">them to the doors of septs and inns for every man to read who can.” </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="272" height="15" font="1">Davos said, “That will be few enough.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Ser Davos speaks truly, Your Grace,” said Maester Pylos. “It would be better to have </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="158" height="15" font="1">the letters read aloud.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="593" height="15" font="1">“Better, but more dangerous,” said Stannis. “These words will not be kindly received.” </text>
</page>
<page number="86" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Give me knights to do the reading,” Davos said. “That will carry more weight than </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="156" height="15" font="1">anything I might say.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis seemed well satisfied with that. “I can give you such men, yes. I have a hundred </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knights who would sooner read than fight. Be open where you can and stealthy where you </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">must. Use every smuggler’s trick you know, the black sails, the hidden coves, whatever it </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">requires. If you run short of letters, capture a few septons and set them to copying out more. I </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mean to use your second son as well. He will take <i>Lady Marya</i> across the narrow sea, to </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Braavos and the other Free Cities, to deliver other letters to the men who rule there. The world </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="1">will know of my claim, and of Cersei’s infamy.” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>You can tell them</i>, Davos thought, <i>but will they believe?</i> He glanced thoughtfully at </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Maester Pylos. The king caught the look. “Maester, perhaps you ought get to your writing. </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">We will need a great many letters, and soon.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="329" height="15" font="1">“As you will.” Pylos bowed, and took his leave. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The king waited until he was gone before he said, “What is it you would not say in the </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">presence of my maester, Davos?” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My liege, Pylos is pleasant enough, but I cannot see the chain about his neck without </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="223" height="15" font="1">mourning for Maester Cressen.” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Is it his fault the old man died?” Stannis glanced into the fire. “I never wanted Cressen </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">at that feast. He’d angered me, yes, he’d given me bad counsel, but I did not want him dead. </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">I’d hoped he might be granted a few years of ease and comfort. He had earned that much, at </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">least, but”—he ground his teeth together—“but he died. And Pylos serves me ably.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="554" height="15" font="1">“Pylos is the least of it. The letter . . . What did your lords make of it, I wonder?” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stannis snorted. “Celtigar pronounced it admirable. If I showed him the contents of my </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">privy, he would declare that admirable as well. The others bobbed their heads up and down </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like a flock of geese, all but Velaryon, who said that steel would decide the matter, not words </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="623" height="15" font="1">on parchment. As if I had never suspected. The Others take my lords, I’ll hear your views.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“Your words were blunt and strong.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="83" height="15" font="1">“And true.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="574" height="15" font="1">“And true. Yet you have no proof. Of this incest. No more than you did a year ago.” </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“There’s proof of a sort at Storm’s End. Robert’s bastard. The one he fathered on my </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wedding night, in the very bed they’d made up for me and my bride. Delena was a Florent, </text>

<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. He is said to be the very image of my brother. If men were to see him, and then look </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">again at Joffrey and Tommen, they could not help but wonder, I would think.” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="377" height="15" font="1">“Yet how are men to see him, if he is at Storm’s End?” </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stannis drummed his fingers on the Painted Table. “It is a difficulty. One of many.” He </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">raised his eyes. “You have more to say about the letter. Well, get on with it. I did not make </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">you a knight so you could learn to mouth empty courtesies. I have my lords for that. Say what </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">you would say, Davos.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Davos bowed his head. “There was a phrase at the end. How did it go? <i>Done in the Light </i></text>

<text top="993" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” The king’s jaw was clenched. </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">“Your people will mislike those words.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="245" height="15" font="1">“As you did?” said Stannis sharply. </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="297" height="15" font="1">“Have you gone devout on me, smuggler?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">“That was to be my question for you, my liege.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Was it now? It sounds as though you love my new god no more than you love my new </text>

<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I do not know this Lord of Light,” Davos admitted, “but I knew the gods we burned this </text>

<text top="352" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“That may be so,” Davos said, “but when I was a boy in Flea Bottom begging for a </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">copper, sometimes the septons would feed me.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="126" height="15" font="1">“<i>I</i> feed you now.” </text>

<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stannis stood abruptly. “<i>R’hllor.</i> Why is that so hard? They will not love me, you say? </text>

<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to the south window to gaze out at the moonlit sea. “I stopped believing in gods the day I saw </text>

<text top="628" left="171" width="231" height="15" font="1">“If you do not believe in gods—” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“—why trouble with this new one?” Stannis broke in. “I have asked myself as well. I </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">know little and care less of gods, but the red priestess has power.” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="5"><i>Yes, but what sort of power?</i> “Cressen had wisdom.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I trusted in his wisdom and your wiles, and what did they avail me, smuggler? The </text>

<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">am I to take it? There are four kings in the realm, and three of them have more men and more </text>

<text top="840" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">such dread in grown men is not to be despised. A frightened man is a beaten man. And </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="314" height="15" font="1">perhaps she <i>can</i> do more. I mean to find out.” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“When I was a lad I found an injured goshawk and nursed her back to health. <i>Proudwing</i>, </text>

<text top="154" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There was no safe anchorage at Pyke, but Theon Greyjoy wished to look on his father’s </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">castle from the sea, to see it as he had seen it last, ten years before, when Robert Baratheon’s </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">war galley had borne him away to be a ward of Eddard Stark. On that day he had stood beside </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the rail, listening to the stroke of the oars and the pounding of the master’s drum while he </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watched Pyke dwindle in the distance. Now he wanted to see it grow larger, to rise from the </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">sea before him. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Obedient to his wishes, the <i>Myraham</i> beat her way past the point with her sails snapping </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and her captain cursing the wind and his crew and the follies of highborn lordlings. Theon </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">drew the hood of his cloak up against the spray, and looked for home. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The shore was all sharp rocks and glowering cliffs, and the castle seemed one with the </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rest, its towers and walls and bridges quarried from the same grey-black stone, wet by the </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same salt waves, festooned with the same spreading patches of dark green lichen, speckled by </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the droppings of the same seabirds. The point of land on which the Greyjoys had raised their </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">fortress had once thrust like a sword into the bowels of the ocean, but the waves had </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hammered at it day and night until the land broke and shattered, thousands of years past. All </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">that remained were three bare and barren islands and a dozen towering stacks of rock that rose </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from the water like the pillars of some sea god’s temple, while the angry waves foamed and </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="149" height="15" font="1">crashed among them. </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Drear, dark, forbidding, Pyke stood atop those islands and pillars, almost a part of them, </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">its curtain wall closing off the headland around the foot of the great stone bridge that leapt </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">from the cliff-top to the largest islet, dominated by the massive bulk of the Great Keep. </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Farther out were the Kitchen Keep and the Bloody Keep, each on its own island. Towers and </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">outbuildings clung to the stacks beyond, linked to each other by covered archways when the </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="544" height="15" font="1">pillars stood close, by long swaying walks of wood and rope when they did not. </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Sea Tower rose from the outmost island at the point of the broken sword, the oldest </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">part of the castle, round and tall, the sheer-sided pillar on which it stood half-eaten through by </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the endless battering of the waves. The base of the tower was white from centuries of salt </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spray, the upper stories green from the lichen that crawled over it like a thick blanket, the </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">jagged crown black with soot from its nightly watchfire. </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Above the Sea Tower snapped his father’s banner. The <i>Myraham</i> was too far off for </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Theon to see more than the cloth itself, but he knew the device it bore: the golden kraken of </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">House Greyjoy, arms writhing and reaching against a black field. The banner streamed from </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">an iron mast, shivering and twisting as the wind gusted, like a bird struggling to take flight. </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">And here at least the direwolf of Stark did not fly above, casting its shadow down upon the </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="114" height="15" font="1">Greyjoy kraken. </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon had never seen a more stirring sight. In the sky behind the castle, the fine red tail </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the comet was visible through thin, scuttling clouds. All the way from Riverrun to Seagard, </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the Mallisters had argued about its meaning. <i>It is my comet</i>, Theon told himself, sliding a hand </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">into his fur-lined cloak to touch the oilskin pouch snug in its pocket. Inside was the letter </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">Robb Stark had given him, paper as good as a crown. </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Does the castle look as you remember it, milord?” the captain’s daughter asked as she </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">pressed herself against his arm. </text>
<text top="1017" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“It looks smaller,” Theon confessed, “though perhaps that is only the distance.” The </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Myraham</i> was a fat-bellied southron merchanter up from Oldtown, carrying wine and cloth </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and seed to trade for iron ore. Her captain was a fat-bellied southron merchanter as well, and </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the stony sea that foamed at the feet of the castle made his plump lips quiver, so he stayed </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">well out, farther than Theon would have liked. An ironborn captain in a longship would have </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">taken them along the cliffs and under the high bridge that spanned the gap between the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gatehouse and the Great Keep, but this plump Oldtowner had neither the craft, the crew, nor </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the courage to attempt such a thing. So they sailed past at a safe distance, and Theon must </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">content himself with seeing Pyke from afar. Even so, the <i>Myraham</i> had to struggle mightily to </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">keep itself off those rocks. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“It must be windy there,” the captain’s daughter observed. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He laughed. “Windy and cold and damp. A miserable hard place, in truth . . . but my lord </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">father once told me that hard places breed hard men, and hard men rule the world.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The captain’s face was as green as the sea when he came bowing up to Theon and asked, </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="265" height="15" font="1">“May we make for port now, milord?” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You may,” Theon said, a faint smile playing about his lips. The promise of gold had </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">turned the Oldtowner into a shameless lickspittle. It would have been a much different voyage </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">if a longship from the islands had been waiting at Seagard as he’d hoped. Ironborn captains </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were proud and willful, and did not go in awe of a man’s blood. The islands were too small </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for awe, and a longship smaller still. If every captain was a king aboard his own ship, as was </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">often said, it was small wonder they named the islands the land of ten thousand kings. And </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">when you have seen your kings shit over the rail and turn green in a storm, it was hard to bend </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the knee and pretend they were gods. “The Drowned God makes men,” old King Urron </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="1">Redhand had once said, thousands of years ago, “but it’s men who make crowns.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A longship would have made the crossing in half the time as well. The <i>Myraham</i> was a </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wallowing tub, if truth be told, and he would not care to be aboard her in a storm. Still, Theon </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could not be too unhappy. He was here, undrowned, and the voyage had offered certain other </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">amusements. He put an arm around the captain’s daughter. “Summon me when we make </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lordsport,” he told her father. “We’ll be below, in my cabin.” He led the girl away aft, while </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">her father watched them go in sullen silence. </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The cabin was the captain’s, in truth, but it had been turned over to Theon’s use when </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they sailed from Seagard. The captain’s daughter had not been turned over to his use, but she </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had come to his bed willingly enough all the same. A cup of wine, a few whispers, and there </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she was. The girl was a shade plump for his taste, with skin as splotchy as oatmeal, but her </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">breasts filled his hands nicely and she had been a maiden the first time he took her. That was </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">surprising at her age, but Theon found it diverting. He did not think the captain approved, and </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that was amusing as well, watching the man struggle to swallow his outrage while performing </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his courtesies to the high lord, the rich purse of gold he’d been promised never far from his </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">thoughts. </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As Theon shrugged out of his wet cloak, the girl said, “You must be so happy to see your </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">home again, milord. How many years have you been away?” </text>
<text top="889" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ten, or close as makes no matter,” he told her. “I was a boy of ten when I was taken to </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Winterfell, as a ward of Eddard Stark.” A ward in name, a hostage in truth. Half his days a </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hostage . . . but no longer. His life was his own again, and nowhere a Stark to be seen. He </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">drew the captain’s daughter close and kissed her on her ear. “Take off your cloak.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She dropped her eyes, suddenly shy, but did as he bid her. When the heavy garment, </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sodden with spray, fell from her shoulders to the deck, she gave him a little bow and smiled </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">anxiously. She looked rather stupid when she smiled, but he had never required a woman to </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">be clever. “Come here,” he told her. </text>
<text top="1056" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">She did. “I have never seen the Iron Islands.” </text>
</page>
<page number="90" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Count yourself fortunate.” Theon stroked her hair. It was fine and dark, though the wind </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had made a tangle of it. “The islands are stern and stony places, scant of comfort and bleak of </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">prospect. Death is never far here, and life is mean and meager. Men spend their nights </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">drinking ale and arguing over whose lot is worse, the fisherfolk who fight the sea or the </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">farmers who try and scratch a crop from the poor thin soil. If truth be told, the miners have it </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">worse than either, breaking their backs down in the dark, and for what? Iron, lead, tin, those </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">are our treasures. Small wonder the ironmen of old turned to raiding.” </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The stupid girl did not seem to be listening. “I could go ashore with you,” she said. “I </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">would, if it please you . . .” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="587" height="15" font="1">“You could go ashore,” Theon agreed, squeezing her breast, “but not with me, I fear.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’d work in your castle, milord. I can clean fish and bake bread and churn butter. Father </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">says my peppercrab stew is the best he’s ever tasted. You could find me a place in your </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="338" height="15" font="1">kitchens and I could make you peppercrab stew.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And warm my bed by night?” He reached for the laces of her bodice and began to undo </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them, his fingers deft and practiced. “Once I might have carried you home as a prize, and kept </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you to wife whether you willed it or no. The ironmen of old did such things. A man had his </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rock wife, his true bride, ironborn like himself, but he had his salt wives too, women captured </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">on raids.” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The girl’s eyes grew wide, and not because he had bared her breasts. “I would be your </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">salt wife, milord.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I fear those days are gone.” Theon’s finger circled one heavy teat, spiraling in toward </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the fat brown nipple. “No longer may we ride the wind with fire and sword, taking what we </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">want. Now we scratch in the ground and toss lines in the sea like other men, and count </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ourselves lucky if we have salt cod and porridge enough to get us through a winter.” He took </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="348" height="15" font="1">her nipple in his mouth, and bit it until she gasped. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="573" height="15" font="1">“You can put it in me again, if it please you,” she whispered in his ear as he sucked. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When he raised his head from her breast, the skin was dark red where his mouth had </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">marked her. “It would please me to teach you something new. Unlace me and pleasure me </text>

<text top="265" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His climax came on him sudden as a storm, and he filled the girl’s mouth with his seed. </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Startled, she tried to pull away, but Theon held her tight by the hair. Afterward, she crawled </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">up beside him. “Did I please milord?” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="191" height="15" font="1">“Well enough,” he told her. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="220" height="15" font="1">“It tasted salty,” she murmured. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="109" height="15" font="1">“Like the sea?” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="351" height="15" font="1">She nodded. “I have always loved the sea, milord.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“As I have,” he said, rolling her nipple idly between his fingers. It was true. The sea </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">meant freedom to the men of the Iron Islands. He had forgotten that until the <i>Myraham</i> had </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">raised sail at Seagard. The sounds brought old feelings back; the creak of wood and rope, the </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">captain’s shouted commands, the snap of the sails as the wind filled them, each as familiar as </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the beating of his own heart, and as comforting. <i>I must remember this</i>, Theon vowed to </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="327" height="15" font="1">himself. <i>I must never go far from the sea again.</i> </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Take me with you, milord,” the captain’s daughter begged. “I don’t need to go to your </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">castle. I can stay in some town, and be your salt wife.” She reached out to stroke his cheek. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon Greyjoy pushed her hand aside and climbed off the bunk. “My place is Pyke, and </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="152" height="15" font="1">yours is on this ship.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="165" height="15" font="1">“I can’t stay here now.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">He laced up his breeches. “Why not?” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My father,” she told him. “Once you’re gone, he’ll punish me, milord. He’ll call me </text>

<text top="736" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Theon swept his cloak off its peg and over his shoulders. “Fathers are like that,” he </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">admitted as he pinned the folds with a silver clasp. “Tell him he should be pleased. As many </text>

<text top="820" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The <i>Myraham</i> was rounding a wooded point. Below the pine-clad bluffs, a dozen fishing </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">boats were pulling in their nets. The big cog stayed well out from them, tacking. Theon </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">moved to the bow for a better view. He saw the castle first, the stronghold of the Botleys. </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">When he was a boy it had been timber and wattle, but Robert Baratheon had razed that </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">structure to the ground. Lord Sawane had rebuilt in stone, for now a small square keep </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crowned the hill. Pale green flags drooped from the squat corner towers, each emblazoned </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">with a shoal of silvery fish. </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beneath the dubious protection of the fish-ridden little castle lay the village of Lordsport, </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">its harbor aswarm with ships. When last he’d seen Lordsport, it had been a smoking </text>

<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the bones of dead leviathans, the houses no more than broken walls and cold ashes. After ten </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">years, few traces of the war remained. The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the old, and cut fresh sod for their roofs. A new inn had risen beside the landing, twice the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">size of the old one, with a lower story of cut stone and two upper stories of timber. The sept </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beyond had never been rebuilt, though; only a seven-sided foundation remained where it had </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stood. Robert Baratheon’s fury had soured the ironmen’s taste for the new gods, it would </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Theon was more interested in ships than gods. Among the masts of countless fishing </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boats, he spied a Tyroshi trading galley off-loading beside a lumbering Ibbenese cog with her </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">black-tarred hull. A great number of longships, fifty or sixty at the least, stood out to sea or </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lay beached on the pebbled shore to the north. Some of the sails bore devices from the other </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">islands; the blood moon of Wynch, Lord Goodbrother’s banded black warhorn, Harlaw’s </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silver scythe. Theon searched for his uncle Euron’s <i>Silence</i>. Of that lean and terrible red ship </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he saw no sign, but his father’s <i>Great Kraken</i> was there, her bow ornamented with a grey iron </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">ram in the shape of its namesake. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Had Lord Balon anticipated him and called the Greyjoy banners? His hand went inside </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his cloak again, to the oilskin pouch. No one knew of his letter but Robb Stark; they were no </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fools, to entrust their secrets to a bird. Still, Lord Balon was no fool either. He might well </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="547" height="15" font="1">have guessed why his son was coming home at long last, and acted accordingly. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The thought did not please him. His father’s war was long done, and lost. This was </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">Theon’s hour—his plan, his glory, and in time his crown. <i>Yet if the longships are hosting . . .</i> </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It might be only a caution, now that he thought on it. A defensive move, lest the war spill </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">out across the sea. Old men were cautious by nature. His father was old now, and so too his </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">uncle Victarion, who commanded the Iron Fleet. His uncle Euron was a different song, to be </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">sure, but the <i>Silence</i> did not seem to be in port. <i>It’s all for the good</i>, Theon told himself. <i>This </i></text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="339" height="15" font="5"><i>way, I shall be able to strike all the more quickly.</i> </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As the <i>Myraham</i> made her way landward, Theon paced the deck restlessly, scanning the </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shore. He had not thought to find Lord Balon himself at quayside, but surely his father would </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">have sent someone to meet him. Sylas Sourmouth the steward, Lord Botley, perhaps even </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dagmer Cleftjaw. It would be good to look on Dagmer’s hideous old face again. It was not as </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">though they had no word of his arrival. Robb had sent ravens from Riverrun, and when they’d </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">found no longship at Seagard, Jason Mallister had sent his own birds to Pyke, supposing that </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">Robb’s were lost. </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yet he saw no familiar faces, no honor guard waiting to escort him from Lordsport to </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Pyke, only smallfolk going about their small business. Shorehands rolled casks of wine off the </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Tyroshi trader, fisherfolk cried the day’s catch, children ran and played. A priest in the </text>

<text top="800" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">while above him a slattern leaned out a window in the inn, calling out to some passing </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="117" height="15" font="1">Ibbenese sailors. </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A handful of Lordsport merchants had gathered to meet the ship. They shouted questions </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as the <i>Myraham</i> was tying up. “We’re out of Oldtown,” the captain called down, “bearing </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">apples and oranges, wines from the Arbor, feathers from the Summer Isles. I have pepper, </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">woven leathers, a bolt of Myrish lace, mirrors for milady, a pair of Oldtown woodharps sweet </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as any you ever heard.” The gangplank descended with a creak and a thud. “And I’ve brought </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="161" height="15" font="1">your heir back to you.” </text>
<text top="967" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The Lordsport men gazed on Theon with blank, bovine eyes, and he realized that they did </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">not know who he was. It made him angry. He pressed a golden dragon into the captain’s </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">palm. “Have your men bring my things.” Without waiting for a reply, he strode down the </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">gangplank. “Innkeeper,” he barked, “I require a horse.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As you say, m’lord,” the man responded, without so much as a bow. He had forgotten </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">how bold the ironborn could be. “Happens as I have one might do. Where would you be </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">riding, m’lord?” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Pyke.” The fool <i>still</i> did not know him. He should have worn his good doublet, with the </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="235" height="15" font="1">kraken embroidered on the breast. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You’ll want to be off soon, to reach Pyke afore dark,” the innkeeper said. “My boy will </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">go with you and show you the way.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Your boy will not be needed,” a deep voice called, “nor your horse. I shall see my </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">nephew back to his father’s house.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The speaker was the priest he had seen leading the horses along the shoreline. As the man </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="652" height="15" font="1">approached, the smallfolk bent the knee, and Theon heard the innkeeper murmur, </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="91" height="15" font="1">“Damphair.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tall and thin, with fierce black eyes and a beak of a nose, the priest was garbed in </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">mottled robes of green and grey and blue, the swirling colors of the Drowned God. A </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">waterskin hung under his arm on a leather strap, and ropes of dried seaweed were braided </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="382" height="15" font="1">through his waist-long black hair and untrimmed beard. </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A memory prodded at Theon. In one of his rare curt letters, Lord Balon had written of his </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">youngest brother going down in a storm, and turning holy when he washed up safe on shore. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">“Uncle Aeron?” he said doubtfully. </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="551" height="15" font="1">“Nephew Theon,” the priest replied. “Your lord father bid me fetch you. Come.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“In a moment, Uncle.” He turned back to the <i>Myraham</i>. “My things,” he commanded the </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">captain. </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A sailor fetched him down his tall yew bow and quiver of arrows, but it was the captain’s </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">daughter who brought the pack with his good clothing. “Milord.” Her eyes were red. When he </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">took the pack, she made as if to embrace him, there in front of her own father and his priestly </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">uncle and half the island. </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">Theon turned deftly aside. “You have my thanks.” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="330" height="15" font="1">“Please,” she said, “I do love you well, milord.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I must go.” He hurried after his uncle, who was already well down the pier. Theon </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">caught him with a dozen long strides. “I had not looked for you, Uncle. After ten years, I </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">thought perhaps my lord father and lady mother might come themselves, or send Dagmer with </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">an honor guard.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It is not for you to question the commands of the Lord Reaper of Pyke.” The priest’s </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">manner was chilly, most unlike the man Theon remembered. Aeron Greyjoy had been the </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">most amiable of his uncles, feckless and quick to laugh, fond of songs, ale, and women. “As </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to Dagmer, the Cleftjaw is gone to Old Wyk at your father’s behest, to roust the Stonehouses </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="129" height="15" font="1">and the Drumms.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“To what purpose? Why are the longships hosting?” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Why have longships ever hosted?” His uncle had left the horses tied up in front of the </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">waterside inn. When they reached them, he turned to Theon. “Tell me true, nephew. Do you </text>

<text top="993" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon seldom prayed at all, but that was not something you confessed to a priest, even </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="627" height="15" font="1">your father’s own brother. “Ned Stark prayed to a tree. No, I care nothing for Stark’s gods.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="110" height="15" font="1">“Good. Kneel.” </text>
<text top="1063" left="171" width="339" height="15" font="1">The ground was all stones and mud. “Uncle, I—” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="560" height="15" font="1">“<i>Kneel.</i> Or are you too proud now, a lordling of the green lands come among us?” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon knelt. He had a purpose here, and might need Aeron’s help to achieve it. A crown </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="454" height="15" font="1">was worth a little mud and horseshit on his breeches, he supposed. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Bow your head.” Lifting the skin, his uncle pulled the cork and directed a thin stream of </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">seawater down upon Theon’s head. It drenched his hair and ran over his forehead into his </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">eyes. Sheets washed down his cheeks, and a finger crept under his cloak and doublet and </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down his back, a cold rivulet along his spine. The salt made his eyes burn, until it was all he </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could do not to cry out. He could taste the ocean on his lips. “Let Theon your servant be born </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">again from the sea, as you were,” Aeron Greyjoy intoned. “Bless him with salt, bless him with </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">stone, bless him with steel. Nephew, do you still know the words?” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="394" height="15" font="1">“What is dead may never die,” Theon said, remembering. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What is dead may never die,” his uncle echoed, “but rises again, harder and stronger. </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">Stand.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon stood, blinking back tears from the salt in his eyes. Wordless, his uncle corked the </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">waterskin, untied his horse, and mounted. Theon did the same. They set off together, leaving </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the inn and the harbor behind them, up past the castle of Lord Botley into the stony hills. The </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="220" height="15" font="1">priest ventured no further word. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I have been half my life away from home,” Theon ventured at last. “Will I find the </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">islands changed?” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Men fish the sea, dig in the earth, and die. Women birth children in blood and pain, and </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="628" height="15" font="1">die. Night follows day. The winds and tides remain. The islands are as our god made them.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods, he has grown grim</i>, Theon thought. “Will I find my sister and my lady mother at </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">Pyke?” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You will not. Your mother dwells on Harlaw, with her own sister. It is less raw there, </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and her cough troubles her. Your sister has taken <i>Black Wind</i> to Great Wyk, with messages </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">from your lord father. She will return e’er long, you may be sure.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon did not need to be told that <i>Black Wind</i> was Asha’s longship. He had not seen his </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sister in ten years, but that much he knew of her. Odd that she would call it that, when Robb </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Stark had a wolf named Grey Wind. “Stark is grey and Greyjoy’s black,” he murmured, </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="287" height="15" font="1">smiling, “but it seems we’re both windy.” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="253" height="15" font="1">The priest had nothing to say to that. </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And what of you, Uncle?” Theon asked. “You were no priest when I was taken from </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Pyke. I remember how you would sing the old reaving songs standing on the table with a horn </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">of ale in hand.” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Young I was, and vain,” Aeron Greyjoy said, “but the sea washed my follies and my </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">vanities away. That man drowned, nephew. His lungs filled with seawater, and the fish ate the </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">scales off his eyes. When I rose again, I saw clearly.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>He is as mad as he is sour.</i> Theon had liked what he remembered of the old Aeron </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="449" height="15" font="1">Greyjoy. “Uncle, why has my father called his swords and sails?” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="252" height="15" font="1">“Doubtless he will tell you at Pyke.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“I would know his plans now.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="538" height="15" font="1">“From me, you shall not. We are commanded not to speak of this to any man.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Even to <i>me?</i>” Theon’s anger flared. He’d led men in war, hunted with a king, won </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">honor in tourney melees, ridden with Brynden Blackfish and Greatjon Umber, fought in the </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Whispering Wood, bedded more girls than he could name, and yet this uncle was treating him </text>

<page number="95" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as though he were still a child of ten. “If my father makes plans for war, I must know of them. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">I am not ‘<i>any man</i>,’ I am heir to Pyke and the Iron Islands.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">“As to that,” his uncle said, “we shall see.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The words were a slap in the face. “<i>We shall see?</i> My brothers are both dead. I am my </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="1">lord father’s only living son.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="134" height="15" font="1">“Your sister lives.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Asha</i>, he thought, confounded. She was three years older than Theon, yet still . . . “A </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">woman may inherit only if there is no male heir in the direct line,” he insisted loudly. “I will </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">not be cheated of my rights, I warn you.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His uncle grunted. “You <i>warn</i> a servant of the Drowned God, boy? You have forgotten </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">more than you know. And you are a great fool if you believe your lord father will ever hand </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">these holy islands over to a Stark. Now be silent. The ride is long enough without your </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">magpie chatterings.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon held his tongue, though not without struggle. <i>So that is the way of it</i>, he thought. </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">As if ten years in Winterfell could make a Stark. Lord Eddard had raised him among his own </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">children, but Theon had never been one of them. The whole castle, from Lady Stark to the </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lowliest kitchen scullion, knew he was hostage to his father’s good behavior, and treated him </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">accordingly. Even the bastard Jon Snow had been accorded more honor than he had. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Eddard had tried to play the father from time to time, but to Theon he had always </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remained the man who’d brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home. As a </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boy, he had lived in fear of Stark’s stern face and great dark sword. His wife was, if anything, </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">even more distant and suspicious. </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As for their children, the younger ones had been mewling babes for most of his years at </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Winterfell. Only Robb and his baseborn half-brother Jon Snow had been old enough to be </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">worth his notice. The bastard was a sullen boy, quick to sense a slight, jealous of Theon’s </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">high birth and Robb’s regard for him. For Robb himself, Theon did have a certain affection, </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as for a younger brother . . . but it would be best not to mention that. In Pyke, it would seem, </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the old wars were still being fought. That ought not surprise him. The Iron Islands lived in the </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">past; the present was too hard and bitter to be borne. Besides, his father and uncles were old, </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and the old lords were like that; they took their dusty feuds to the grave, forgetting nothing </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="130" height="15" font="1">and forgiving less. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It had been the same with the Mallisters, his companions on the ride from Riverrun to </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Seagard. Patrek Mallister was not too ill a fellow; they shared a taste for wenches, wine, and </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hawking. But when old Lord Jason saw his heir growing overly fond of Theon’s company, he </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had taken Patrek aside to remind him that Seagard had been built to defend the coast against </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">reavers from the Iron islands, the Greyjoys of Pyke chief among them. Their Booming Tower </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was named for its immense bronze bell, rung of old to call the townsfolk and farmhands into </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="431" height="15" font="1">the castle when longships were sighted on the western horizon. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Never mind that the bell has been rung just once in three hundred years,” Patrek had </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">told Theon the day after, as he shared his father’s cautions and a jug of green-apple wine. </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When my brother stormed Seagard,” Theon said. Lord Jason had slain Rodrik Greyjoy </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">under the walls of the castle, and thrown the ironmen back into the bay. “If your father </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="572" height="15" font="1">supposes I bear him some enmity for that, it’s only because he never knew Rodrik.” </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They had a laugh over that as they raced ahead to an amorous young miller’s wife that </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Patrek knew. <i>Would that Patrek were with me now.</i> Mallister or no, he was a more amiable </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">riding companion than this sour old priest that his uncle Aeron had turned into. </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">plodding pace, past a shepherd’s croft and the abandoned workings of a mine. This new, holy </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Aeron Greyjoy was not much for talk. They rode in a gloom of silence. Finally Theon could </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="465" height="15" font="1">suffer it no longer. “Robb Stark is Lord of Winterfell now,” he said. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="344" height="15" font="1">Aeron rode on. “One wolf is much like the other.” </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="203" height="15" font="1">“It means a new day, Uncle.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">“Every morning brings a new day, much like the old.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“In Riverrun, they would tell you different. They say the red comet is a herald of a new </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">age. A messenger from the gods.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A sign it is,” the priest agreed, “but from our god, not theirs. A burning brand it is, such </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as our people carried of old. It is the flame the Drowned God brought from the sea, and it </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">proclaims a rising tide. It is time to hoist our sails and go forth into the world with fire and </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="126" height="15" font="1">sword, as he did.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">Theon smiled. “I could not agree more.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“A man agrees with god as a raindrop with the storm.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>This raindrop will one day be a king, old man.</i> Theon had suffered quite enough of his </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="520" height="15" font="1">uncle’s gloom. He put his spurs into his horse and trotted on ahead, smiling. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was nigh on sunset when they reached the walls of Pyke, a crescent of dark stone that </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ran from cliff to cliff, with the gatehouse in the center and three square towers to either side. </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon could still make out the scars left by the stones of Robert Baratheon’s catapults. A new </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">south tower had risen from the ruins of the old, its stone a paler shade of grey, and as yet </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">unmarred by patches of lichen. That was where Robert had made his breach, swarming in </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">over the rubble and corpses with his warhammer in hand and Ned Stark at his side. Theon had </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">watched from the safety of the Sea Tower, and sometimes he still saw the torches in his </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="347" height="15" font="1">dreams, and heard the dull thunder of the collapse. </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The gates stood open to him, the rusted iron portcullis drawn up. The guards atop the </text>

<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beyond the curtain wall were half a hundred acres of headland hard against the sky and </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the sea. The stables were here, and the kennels, and a scatter of other outbuildings. Sheep and </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">swine huddled in their pens while the castle dogs ran free. To the south were the cliffs, and </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the wide stone bridge to the Great Keep. Theon could hear the crashing of waves as he swung </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down from his saddle. A stableman came to take his horse. A pair of gaunt children and some </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thralls stared at him with dull eyes, but there was no sign of his lord father, nor anyone else he </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="464" height="15" font="1">recalled from boyhood. <i>A bleak and bitter homecoming</i>, he thought. </text>

<text top="408" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stiffly, she led him across the headland to the bridge. That at least was as he remembered; the </text>
<text top="428" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ancient stones slick with spray and spotted by lichen, the sea foaming under their feet like </text>
<text top="447" left="139" width="422" height="15" font="1">some great wild beast, the salt wind clutching at their clothes. </text>
<text top="472" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Whenever he’d imagined his homecoming, he had always pictured himself returning to </text>
<text top="492" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the snug bedchamber in the Sea Tower, where he’d slept as a child. Instead the old woman led </text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him to the Bloody Keep. The halls here were larger and better furnished, if no less cold nor </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">damp. Theon was given a suite of chilly rooms with ceilings so high that they were lost in </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gloom. He might have been more impressed if he had not known that these were the very </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chambers that had given the Bloody Keep its name. A thousand years before, the sons of the </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">River King had been slaughtered here, hacked to bits in their beds so that pieces of their </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="394" height="15" font="1">bodies might be sent back to their father on the mainland. </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But Greyjoys were not murdered in Pyke except once in a great while by their brothers, </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and his brothers were both dead. It was not fear of ghosts that made him glance about with </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">distaste. The wall hangings were green with mildew, the mattress musty-smelling and </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sagging, the rushes old and brittle. Years had come and gone since these chambers had last </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">been opened. The damp went bone-deep. “I’ll have a basin of hot water and a fire in this </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hearth,” he told the crone. “See that they light braziers in the other rooms to drive out some of </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="556" height="15" font="1">the chill. And gods be good, get someone in here at once to change these rushes.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="297" height="15" font="1">“Yes, m’lord. As you command.” She fled. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After some time, they brought the hot water he had asked for. It was only tepid, and soon </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cold, and seawater in the bargain, but it served to wash the dust of the long ride from his face </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and hair and hands. While two thralls lit his braziers, Theon stripped off his travel-stained </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">clothing and dressed to meet his father. He chose boots of supple black leather, soft </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">lambswool breeches of silvery-grey, a black velvet doublet with the golden kraken of the </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Greyjoys embroidered on the breast. Around his throat he fastened a slender gold chain, </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">around his waist a belt of bleached white leather. He hung a dirk at one hip and a longsword </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at the other, in scabbards striped black-and-gold. Drawing the dirk, he tested its edge with his </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thumb, pulled a whetstone from his belt pouch, and gave it a few licks. He prided himself on </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">keeping his weapons sharp. “When I return, I shall expect a warm room and clean rushes,” he </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">warned the thralls as he drew on a pair of black gloves, the silk decorated with a delicate </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">scrollwork tracery in golden thread. </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon returned to the Great Keep through a covered stone walkway, the echoes of his </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">footsteps mingling with the ceaseless rumble of the sea below. To get to the Sea Tower on its </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">crooked pillar, he had to cross three further bridges, each narrower than the one before. The </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">last was made of rope and wood, and the wet salt wind made it sway underfoot like a living </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thing. Theon’s heart was in his mouth by the time he was halfway across. A long way below, </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the waves threw up tall plumes of spray as they crashed against the rock. As a boy, he used to </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">run across this bridge, even in the black of night. <i>Boys believe nothing can hurt them</i>, his </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">doubt whispered. <i>Grown men know better.</i> </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The door was grey wood studded with iron, and Theon found it barred from the inside. </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He hammered on it with a fist, and cursed when a splinter snagged the fabric of his glove. The </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="1">wood was damp and moldy, the iron studs rusted. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">After a moment the door was opened from within by a guard in a black iron breastplate </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">and pot-helm. “You are the son?” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Out of my way, or you’ll learn who I am.” The man stood aside. Theon climbed the </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">twisting steps to the solar. He found his father seated beside a brazier, beneath a robe of musty </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sealskins that covered him foot to chin. At the sound of boots on stone, the Lord of the Iron </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Islands lifted his eyes to behold his last living son. He was smaller than Theon remembered </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. And so gaunt. Balon Greyjoy had always been thin, but now he looked as though the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gods had put him in a cauldron and boiled every spare ounce of flesh from his bones, until </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">nothing remained but hair and skin. Bone-thin and bone-hard he was, with a face that might </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have been chipped from flint. His eyes were flinty too, black and sharp, but the years and the </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">salt winds had turned his hair the grey of a winter sea, flecked with whitecaps. Unbound, it </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">hung past the small of the back. </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">“Nine years, is it?” Lord Balon said at last. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="354" height="15" font="1">“Ten,” Theon answered, pulling off his torn gloves. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“A boy they took,” his father said. “What are you now?” </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="385" height="15" font="1">“A man,” Theon answered. “Your blood and your heir.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="251" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon grunted. “We shall see.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="208" height="15" font="1">“You shall,” Theon promised. </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="563" height="15" font="1">“Ten years, you say. Stark had you as long as I. And now you come as his envoy.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="549" height="15" font="1">“Not his,” Theon said. “Lord Eddard is dead, beheaded by the Lannister queen.” </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They are both dead, Stark and that Robert who broke my walls with his stones. I vowed </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">I’d live to see them both in their graves, and I have.” He grimaced. “Yet the cold and the </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">damp still make my joints ache, as when they were alive. So what does it serve?” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">“It serves.” Theon moved closer. “I bring a letter—” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Did Ned Stark dress you like that?” his father interrupted, squinting up from beneath his </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">robe. “Was it his pleasure to garb you in velvets and silks and make you his own sweet </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">daughter?” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon felt the blood rising to his face. “I am no man’s daughter. If you mislike my garb, </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">I will change it.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You will.” Throwing off the furs, Lord Balon pushed himself to his feet. He was not so </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">tall as Theon remembered. “That bauble around your neck—was it bought with gold or iron?” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon touched the gold chain. He had forgotten. <i>It has been so long . . .</i> In the Old Way, </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">women might decorate themselves with ornaments bought with coin, but a warrior wore only </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the jewelry he took off the corpses of enemies slain by his own hand. <i>Paying the iron price</i>, it </text>

<page number="99" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You blush red as a maid, Theon. A question was asked. Is it the gold price you paid, or </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">the iron?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="199" height="15" font="1">“The gold,” Theon admitted. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His father slid his fingers under the necklace and gave it a yank so hard it was like to take </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon’s head off, had the chain not snapped first. “My daughter has taken an axe for a lover,” </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon said. “I will not have my son bedeck himself like a whore.” He dropped the </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">broken chain onto the brazier, where it slid down among the coals. “It is as I feared. The green </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">lands have made you soft, and the Starks have made you theirs.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="531" height="15" font="1">“You’re wrong. Ned Stark was my gaoler, but my blood is still salt and iron.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon turned away to warm his bony hands over the brazier. “Yet the Stark pup </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">sends you to me like a well-trained raven, clutching his little message.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“There is nothing small about the letter I bear,” Theon said, “and the offer he makes is </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">one <i>I</i> suggested to him.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="604" height="15" font="1">“This wolf king heeds your counsel, does he?” The notion seemed to amuse Lord Balon. </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He heeds me, yes. I’ve hunted with him, trained with him, shared meat and mead with </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">him, warred at his side. I have earned his trust. He looks on me as an older brother, he—” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>No.</i>” His father jabbed a finger at his face. “Not here, not in Pyke, not in my hearing, </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">you will not name him <i>brother</i>, this son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword. </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="485" height="15" font="1">Or have you forgotten Rodrik and Maron, who were your own blood?” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I forget nothing.” Ned Stark had killed neither of his brothers, in truth. Rodrik had been </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">slain by Lord Jason Mallister at Seagard, Maron crushed in the collapse of the old south </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tower . . . but Stark <i>would</i> have done for them just as quick had the tide of battle chanced to </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">sweep them together. “I remember my brothers very well,” Theon insisted. Chiefly he </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">remembered Rodrik’s drunken cuffs and Maron’s cruel japes and endless lies. “I remember </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">when my father was a king too.” He took out Robb’s letter and thrust it forward. “Here. Read </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">it . . . Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon broke the seal and unfolded the parchment. His black eyes flicked back and </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">forth. “So the boy would give me a crown again,” he said, “and all I need do is destroy his </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="1">enemies.” His thin lips twisted in a smile. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“By now Robb is at the Golden Tooth,” Theon said. “Once it falls, he’ll be through the </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hills in a day. Lord Tywin’s host is at Harrenhal, cut off from the west. The Kingslayer is a </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">captive at Riverrun. Only Ser Stafford Lannister and the raw green levies he’s been gathering </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">remain to oppose Robb in the west. Ser Stafford will put himself between Robb’s army and </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lannisport, which means the city will be undefended when we descend on it by sea. If the </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gods are with us, even Casterly Rock itself may fall before the Lannisters so much as realize </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">that we are upon them.” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="373" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon grunted. “Casterly Rock has never fallen.” </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">“Until now.” Theon smiled. <i>And how sweet that will be.</i> </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His father did not return the smile. “So this is why Robb Stark sends you back to me, </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">after so long? So you might win my consent to this plan of his?” </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It is my plan, not Robb’s,” Theon said proudly. <i>Mine, as the victory will be mine, and in </i></text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>time the crown.</i> “I will lead the attack myself, if it please you. As my reward I would ask that </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">you grant me Casterly Rock for my own seat, once we have taken it from the Lannisters.” </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">With the Rock, he could hold Lannisport and the golden lands of the west. It would mean </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="411" height="15" font="1">wealth and power such as House Greyjoy had never known. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You reward yourself handsomely for a notion and a few lines of scribbling.” His father </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">read the letter again. “The pup says nothing about a reward. Only that you speak for him, and </text>

<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">taken away.” Lord Balon tossed the letter onto the brazier, atop the necklace. The parchment </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="238" height="15" font="1">curled, blackened, and took flame. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">Theon was aghast. “Have you gone mad?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His father laid a stinging backhand across his cheek. “Mind your tongue. You are not in </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Winterfell now, and I am not Robb the Boy, that you should speak to me so. I am the Greyjoy, </text>

<text top="424" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon edged backward, away from the sudden fury in his father’s tone. “Take it, then,” </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">he spat, his cheek still tingling. “Call yourself King of the Iron islands, no one will </text>

<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon laughed. “Well, at the least you are no craven. No more than I’m a fool. Do </text>

<text top="731" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Dothraki named the comet <i>shierak qiya</i>, the Bleeding Star. The old men muttered </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that it omened ill, but Daenerys Targaryen had seen it first on the night she had burned Khal </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Drogo, the night her dragons had awakened. <i>It is the herald of my coming</i>,<i> </i>she told herself as </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she gazed up into the night sky with wonder in her heart. <i>The gods have sent it to show me the </i></text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="36" height="15" font="5"><i>way.</i> </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yet when she put the thought into words, her handmaid Doreah quailed. “That way lies </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="448" height="15" font="1">the red lands, <i>Khaleesi</i>. A grim place and terrible, the riders say.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The way the comet points is the way we must go,” Dany insisted . . . though in truth, it </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">was the only way open to her. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">She dare not turn north onto the vast ocean of grass they called the Dothraki sea. The first </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>khalasar</i> they met would swallow up her ragged band, slaying the warriors and slaving the </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rest. The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river were likewise closed to them. They were </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">too few to defend themselves even against that unwarlike folk, and the Lhazareen had small </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">reason to love them. She might have struck downriver for the ports at Meereen and Yunkai </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and Astapor, but Rakharo warned her that Pono’s <i>khalasar</i> had ridden that way, driving </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thousands of captives before them to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shores of Slaver’s Bay. “Why should I fear Pono?” Dany objected. “He was Drogo’s <i>ko</i>, and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">always spoke me gently.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ko Pono spoke you gently,” Ser Jorah Mormont said. “Khal Pono will kill you. He was </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">the first to abandon Drogo. Ten thousand warriors went with him. You have a hundred.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>No</i>, Dany thought. <i>I have four. The rest are women, old sick men and boys whose hair </i></text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="5"><i>has never been braided.</i> “I have the dragons,” she pointed out. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Hatchlings,” Ser Jorah said. “One swipe from an <i>arakh</i> would put an end to them, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">though Pono is more like to seize them for himself. Your dragon eggs were more precious </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than rubies. A living dragon is beyond price. In all the world, there are only three. Every man </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">who sees them will want them, my queen.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They are <i>mine</i>,” she said fiercely. They had been born from her faith and her need, </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">given life by the deaths of her husband and unborn son and the <i>maegi</i> Mirri Maz Duur. Dany </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had walked into the flames as they came forth, and they had drunk milk from her swollen </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="378" height="15" font="1">breasts. “No man will take them from me while I live.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You will not live long should you meet Khal Pono. Nor Khal Jhaqo, nor any of the </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">others. You must go where they do not.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Dany had named him the first of her Queensguard . . . and when Mormont’s gruff </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">counsel and the omens agreed, her course was clear. She called her people together and </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mounted her silver mare. Her hair had burned away in Drogo’s pyre, so her handmaids garbed </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her in the skin of the <i>hrakkar</i> Drogo had slain, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. Its fearsome </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">head made a hood to cover her naked scalp, its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and down her back. The cream-colored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lion’s mane </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">and coiled its tail around her arm, while Ser Jorah took his accustomed place by her side. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We follow the comet,” Dany told her <i>khalasar</i>. Once it was said, no word was raised </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">against it. They had been Drogo’s people, but they were hers now. <i>The Unburnt</i>, they called </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">her, and <i>Mother of Dragons</i>. Her word was their law. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They rode by night, and by day took refuge from the sun beneath their tents. Soon </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">enough Dany learned the truth of Doreah’s words. This was no kindly country. They left a </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trail of dead and dying horses behind them as they went, for Pono, Jhaqo, and the others had </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seized the best of Drogo’s herds, leaving to Dany the old and the scrawny, the sickly and the </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lame, the broken animals and the ill-tempered. It was the same with the people. <i>They are not </i></text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>strong</i>, she told herself, <i>so I must be their strength. I must show no fear, no weakness, no </i></text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>doubt. However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo’s </i></text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>queen.</i> She felt older than her fourteen years. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">done. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Three days into the march, the first man died. A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes, </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not rise again. An hour later he was done. Blood </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living. “His time was past,” her </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">handmaid Irri declared. “No man should live longer than his teeth.” The others agreed. Dany </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bid them kill the weakest of their dying horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">night lands. </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Two nights later, it was an infant girl who perished. Her mother’s anguished wailing </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lasted all day, but there was nothing to be done. The child had been too young to ride, poor </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="588" height="15" font="1">thing. Not for her the endless black grasses of the night lands; she must be born again. </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There was little forage in the red waste, and less water. It was a sere and desolate land of </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">low hills and barren windswept plains. The rivers they crossed were dry as dead men’s bones. </text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Their mounts subsisted on the tough brown devilgrass that grew in clumps at the base of rocks </text>
</page>
<page number="102" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and dead trees. Dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column, but they found neither wells </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nor springs, only bitter pools, shallow and stagnant, shrinking in the hot sun. The deeper they </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rode into the waste, the smaller the pools became, while the distance between them grew. If </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay, they were hard dry </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="204" height="15" font="1">gods, deaf to prayers for rain. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Wine gave out first, and soon thereafter the clotted mare’s milk the horselords loved </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">better than mead. Then their stores of flatbread and dried meat were exhausted as well. Their </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">hunters found no game, and only the flesh of their dead horses filled their bellies. Death </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">followed death. Weak children, wrinkled old women, the sick and the stupid and the heedless, </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the cruel land claimed them all. Doreah grew gaunt and hollow-eyed, and her soft golden hair </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="156" height="15" font="1">turned brittle as straw. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany hungered and thirsted with the rest of them. The milk in her breasts dried up, her </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nipples cracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was lean and </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for. Her father had been slain before she was </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">born, and her splendid brother Rhaegar as well. Her mother had died bringing her into the </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">world while the storm screamed outside. Gentle Ser Willem Darry, who must have loved her </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">after a fashion, had been taken by a wasting sickness when she was very young. Her brother </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Viserys, Khal Drogo who was her sun-and-stars, even her unborn son, the gods had claimed </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">them all. <i>They will not have my dragons</i>, Dany vowed. <i>They will not.</i> </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The dragons were no larger than the scrawny cats she had once seen skulking along the </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">walls of Magister Illyrio’s estate in Pentos . . . until they unfolded their wings. Their span was </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">three times their length, each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin, gorgeously colored, </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stretched taut between long thin bones. When you looked hard, you could see that most of </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their body was neck, tail, and wing. <i>Such little things</i>, she thought as she fed them by hand, or </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rather, tried to feed them, for the dragons would not eat. They would hiss and spit at each </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bloody morsel of horsemeat, steam rising from their nostrils, yet they would not take the </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="586" height="15" font="1">food . . . until Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were children. </text>
<text top="652" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="5"><i>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat</i>, he had said. </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, the dragons ripped at it eagerly, </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their heads striking like snakes. So long as the meat was seared, they gulped down several </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">times their own weight every day, and at last began to grow larger and stronger. Dany </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">marveled at the smoothness of their scales, and the <i>heat</i> that poured off them, so palpable that </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Each evenfall as the <i>khalasar</i> set out, she would choose a dragon to ride upon her </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">shoulder. Irri and Jhiqui carried the others in a cage of woven wood slung between their </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mounts, and rode close behind her, so Dany was never out of their sight. It was the only way </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">to keep them quiescent. </text>
<text top="864" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aegon’s dragons were named for the gods of Old Valyria,” she told her bloodriders one </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">morning after a long night’s journey. “Visenya’s dragon was Vhagar, Rhaenys had Meraxes, </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Aegon rode Balerion, the Black Dread. It was said that Vhagar’s breath was so hot that it </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could melt a knight’s armor and cook the man inside, that Meraxes swallowed horses whole, </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Balerion . . . his fire was as black as his scales, his wings so vast that whole towns were </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="395" height="15" font="1">swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead.” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily. The largest of her three was shiny black, </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns. “<i>Khaleesi</i>,” </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="354" height="15" font="1">Aggo murmured, “there sits Balerion, come again.” </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It may be as you say, blood of my blood,” Dany replied gravely, “but he shall have a </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">new name for this new life. I would name them all for those the gods have taken. The green </text>

<page number="103" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one shall be Rhaegal, for my valiant brother who died on the green banks of the Trident. The </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cream-and-gold I call Viserion. Viserys was cruel and weak and frightened, yet he was my </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="355" height="15" font="1">brother still. His dragon will do what he could not.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="344" height="15" font="1">“And the black beast?” asked Ser Jorah Mormont. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“The black,” she said, “is Drogon.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Yet even as her dragons prospered, her <i>khalasar</i> withered and died. Around them the </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">land turned ever more desolate. Even devilgrass grew scant; horses dropped in their tracks, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot. Doreah took a fever and </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters, her </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse. Jhogo </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dothraki sea, when the Lysene girl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She gave Doreah water from her own skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="572" height="15" font="1">hand until she died, shivering. Only then would she permit the <i>khalasar</i> to press on. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They saw no sign of other travelers. The Dothraki began to mutter fearfully that the </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">comet had led them to some hell. Dany went to Ser Jorah one morning as they made camp </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">amidst a jumble of black wind-scoured stones. “Are we lost?” she asked him. “Does this </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">waste have no end to it?” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It has an end,” he answered wearily. “I have seen the maps the traders draw, my queen. </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Few caravans come this way, that is so, yet there are great kingdoms to the east, and cities full </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="364" height="15" font="1">of wonders. Yi Ti, Qarth, Asshai by the Shadow . . .” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="192" height="15" font="1">“Will we live to see them?” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I will not lie to you. The way is harder than I dared think.” The knight’s face was grey </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">and exhausted. The wound he had taken to his hip the night he fought Khal Drogo’s </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">bloodriders had never fully healed; she could see how he grimaced when he mounted his </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horse, and he seemed to slump in his saddle as they rode. “Perhaps we are doomed if we press </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="479" height="15" font="1">on . . . but I know for a certainty that we are doomed if we turn back.” </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany kissed him lightly on the cheek. It heartened her to see him smile. <i>I must be strong </i></text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>for him as well</i>, she thought grimly. <i>A knight he may be, but I am the blood of the dragon.</i> </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The next pool they found was scalding-hot and stinking of brimstone, but their skins </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">were almost empty. The Dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank it tepid. The </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">taste was no less foul, but water was water, and all of them thirsted. Dany looked at the </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">horizon with despair. They had lost a third of their number, and still the waste stretched </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before them, bleak and red and endless. <i>The comet mocks my hopes</i>, she thought, lifting her </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">eyes to where it scored the sky. <i>Have I crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons </i></text>

<text top="862" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The next day, dawn broke as they were crossing a cracked and fissured plain of hard red </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">earth. Dany was about to command them to make camp when her outriders came racing back </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at a gallop. “A city, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” they cried. “A city pale as the moon and lovely as a maid. An </text>

<text top="945" left="171" width="150" height="15" font="1">“Show me,” she said. </text>
<text top="970" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the city appeared before her, its walls and towers shimmering white behind a veil </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of heat, it looked so beautiful that Dany was certain it must be a mirage. “Do you know what </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="220" height="15" font="1">place this might be? Ser Jorah.” </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The exile knight gave a weary shake of the head. “No, my queen. I have never traveled </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The distant white walls promised rest and safety, a chance to heal and grow strong, and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dany wanted nothing so much as to rush toward them. Instead she turned to her bloodriders. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“Blood of my blood, go ahead of us and learn the name of this city, and what manner of </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">welcome we should expect.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="184" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ai, Khaleesi</i>,” said Aggo. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Her riders were not long in returning. Rakharo swung down from his saddle. From his </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">medallion belt hung the great curving <i>arakh</i> that Dany had bestowed on him when she named </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him bloodrider. “This city is dead, <i>Khaleesi</i>. Nameless and godless we found it, the gates </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">broken, only wind and flies moving through the streets.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jhiqui shuddered. “When the gods are gone, the evil ghosts feast by night. Such places </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">are best shunned. It is known.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="179" height="15" font="1">“It is known,” Irri agreed. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Not to me.” Dany put her heels into her horse and showed them the way, trotting </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">beneath the shattered arch of an ancient gate and down a silent street. Ser Jorah and her </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">bloodriders followed, and then, more slowly, the rest of the Dothraki. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">How long the city had been deserted she could not know, but the white walls, so </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beautiful from afar, were cracked and crumbling when seen up close. Inside was a maze of </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">narrow crooked alleys. The buildings pressed close, their facades blank, chalky, windowless. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Everything was white, as if the people who lived here had known nothing of color. They rode </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">past heaps of sun-washed rubble where houses had fallen in, and elsewhere saw the faded </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scars of fire. At a place where six alleys came together, Dany passed an empty marble plinth. </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dothraki had visited this place before, it would seem. Perhaps even now the missing statue </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stood among the other stolen gods in Vaes Dothrak. She might have ridden past it a hundred </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">times, never knowing. On her shoulder, Viserion <i>hissed</i>. </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They made camp before the remnants of a gutted palace, on a windswept plaza where </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">devilgrass grew between the paving stones. Dany sent out men to search the ruins. Some went </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">reluctantly, yet they went . . . and one scarred old man returned a brief time later, hopping and </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grinning, his hands overflowing with figs. They were small, withered things, yet her people </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">grabbed for them greedily, jostling and pushing at each other, stuffing the fruit into their </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">cheeks and chewing blissfully. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Other searchers returned with tales of other fruit trees, hidden behind closed doors in </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">secret gardens. Aggo showed her a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grapes, and Jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold. Yet they found bones </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">too, the skulls of the unburied dead, bleached and broken. “Ghosts,” Irri muttered. “Terrible </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="411" height="15" font="1">ghosts. We must not stay here, <i>Khaleesi</i>, this is their place.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I fear no ghosts. Dragons are more powerful than ghosts.” <i>And figs are more important.</i> </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Go with Jhiqui and find me some clean sand for a bath, and trouble me no more with silly </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">talk.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the coolness of her tent, Dany blackened horsemeat over a brazier and reflected on her </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">choices. There was food and water here to sustain them, and enough grass for the horses to </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">regain their strength. How pleasant it would be to wake every day in the same place, to linger </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="559" height="15" font="1">among shady gardens, eat figs, and drink cool water, as much as she might desire. </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When Irri and Jhiqui returned with pots of white sand, Dany stripped and let them scrub </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her clean. “Your hair is coming back, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Jhiqui said as she scraped sand off her back. </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dany ran a hand over the top of her head, feeling the new growth. Dothraki men wore their </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hair in long oiled braids, and cut them only when defeated. <i>Perhaps I should do the same</i>, she </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought, <i>to remind them that Drogo’s strength lives within me now.</i> Khal Drogo had died with </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="302" height="15" font="1">his hair uncut, a boast few men could make. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Across the tent, Rhaegal unfolded green wings to flap and flutter a half-foot before </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thumping to the carpet. When he landed, his tail lashed back and forth in fury, and he raised </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his head and screamed. <i>If I had wings, I would want to fly too</i>, Dany thought. The Targaryens </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of old had ridden upon dragonback when they went to war. She tried to imagine what it would </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">feel like, to straddle a dragon’s neck and soar high into the air. <i>It would be like standing on a </i></text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>mountaintop, only better. The whole world would be spread out below. If I flew high enough, I </i></text>
<text top="266" left="139" width="488" height="15" font="5"><i>could even see the Seven Kingdoms, and reach up and touch the comet.</i> </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Irri broke her reverie to tell her that Ser Jorah Mormont was outside, awaiting her </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pleasure. “Send him in,” Dany commanded, sand-scrubbed skin tingling. She wrapped herself </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the lionskin. The <i>hrakkar</i> had been much bigger than Dany, so the pelt covered everything </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">that wanted covering. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ve brought you a peach,” Ser Jorah said, kneeling. It was so small she could almost </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hide it in her palm, and overripe too, but when she took the first bite, the flesh was so sweet </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she almost cried. She ate it slowly, savoring every mouthful, while Ser Jorah told her of the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">tree it had been plucked from, in a garden near the western wall. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Fruit and water and shade,” Dany said, her cheeks sticky with peach juice. “The gods </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="250" height="15" font="1">were good to bring us to this place.” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“We should rest here until we are stronger,” the knight urged. “The red lands are not kind </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">to the weak.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">“My handmaids say there are ghosts here.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There are ghosts everywhere,” Ser Jorah said softly. “We carry them with us wherever </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">we go.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Yes</i>, she thought. <i>Viserys, Khal Drogo, my son Rhaego, they are with me always.</i> “Tell </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="399" height="15" font="1">me the name of your ghost, Jorah. You know all of mine.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">His face grew very still. “Her name was Lynesse.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="96" height="15" font="1">“Your wife?” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="133" height="15" font="1">“My second wife.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>It pains him to speak of her</i>, Dany saw, but she wanted to know the truth. “Is that all you </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would say of her?” The lion pelt slid off one shoulder and she tugged it back into place. “Was </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="106" height="15" font="1">she beautiful?” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Very beautiful.” Ser Jorah lifted his eyes from her shoulder to her face. “The first time I </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beheld her, I thought she was a goddess come to earth, the Maid herself made flesh. Her birth </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">was far above my own. She was the youngest daughter of Lord Leyton Hightower of </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Oldtown. The White Bull who commanded your father’s Kingsguard was her great-uncle. The </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="418" height="15" font="1">Hightowers are an ancient family, very rich and very proud.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And loyal,” Dany said. “I remember, Viserys said the Hightowers were among those </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">who stayed true to my father.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="174" height="15" font="1">“That’s so,” he admitted. </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="249" height="15" font="1">“Did your fathers make the match?” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No,” he said. “Our marriage . . . that makes a long tale and a dull one, Your Grace. I </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">would not trouble you with it.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="296" height="15" font="1">“I have nowhere to go,” she said. “Please.” </text>

<page number="106" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As my queen commands.” Ser Jorah frowned. “My home . . . you must understand that </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to understand the rest. Bear Island is beautiful, but remote. Imagine old gnarled oaks and tall </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pines, flowering thornbushes, grey stones bearded with moss, little creeks running icy down </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steep hillsides. The hall of the Mormonts is built of huge logs and surrounded by an earthen </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">palisade. Aside from a few crofters, my people live along the coasts and fish the seas. The </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="638" height="15" font="1">island lies far to the north, and our winters are more terrible than you can imagine, <i>Khaleesi.</i>” </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Still, the island suited me well enough, and I never lacked for women. I had my share of </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fishwives and crofter’s daughters, before and after I was wed. I married young, to a bride of </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">my father’s choosing, a Glover of Deepwood Motte. Ten years we were wed, or near enough </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as makes no matter. She was a plain-faced woman, but not unkind. I suppose I came to love </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her after a fashion, though our relations were dutiful rather than passionate. Three times she </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">miscarried while trying to give me an heir. The last time she never recovered. She died not </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">long after.” </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="576" height="15" font="1">Dany put her hand on his and gave his fingers a squeeze. “I am sorry for you, truly.” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah nodded. “By then my father had taken the black, so I was Lord of Bear Island </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in my own right. I had no lack of marriage offers, but before I could reach a decision Lord </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion against the Usurper, and Ned Stark called his banners to help </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">his friend Robert. The final battle was on Pyke. When Robert’s stonethrowers opened a </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">breach in King Balon’s wall, a priest from Myr was the first man through, but I was not far </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">behind. For that I won my knighthood.” </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“To celebrate his victory, Robert ordained that a tourney should be held outside </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lannisport. It was there I saw Lynesse, a maid half my age. She had come up from Oldtown </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">with her father to see her brothers joust. I could not take my eyes off her. In a fit of madness, I </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">begged her favor to wear in the tourney, never dreaming she would grant my request, yet she </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">did.” </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I fight as well as any man, <i>Khaleesi</i>, but I have never been a tourney knight. Yet with </text>

<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Robert gave me the champion’s laurel. I crowned Lynesse queen of love and beauty, and that </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">very night went to her father and asked for her hand. I was drunk, as much on glory as on </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wine. By rights I should have gotten a contemptuous refusal, but Lord Leyton accepted my </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">offer. We were married there in Lannisport, and for a fortnight I was the happiest man in the </text>

<text top="819" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Only a fortnight?” asked Dany. <i>Even I was given more happiness than that, with Drogo </i></text>

<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">home was a great disappointment to Lynesse. It was too cold, too damp, too far away, my </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">castle no more than a wooden longhall. We had no masques, no mummer shows, no balls or </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">fairs. Seasons might pass without a singer ever coming to play for us, and there’s not a </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">goldsmith on the island. Even meals became a trial. My cook knew little beyond his roasts </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">and stews, and Lynesse soon lost her taste for fish and venison.” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I lived for her smiles, so I sent all the way to Oldtown for a new cook, and brought a </text>

<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">worse than before. I could no longer pay the cook and the harper, and Lynesse grew wild </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">when I spoke of pawning her jewels.” </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The rest . . . I did things it shames me to speak of. For gold. So Lynesse might keep her </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">jewels, her harper, and her cook. In the end it cost me all. When I heard that Eddard Stark was </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">coming to Bear Island, I was so lost to honor that rather than stay and face his judgment, I </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">took her with me into exile. Nothing mattered but our love, I told myself. We fled to Lys, </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="289" height="15" font="1">where I sold my ship for gold to keep us.” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His voice was thick with grief, and Dany was reluctant to press him any further, yet she </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">had to know how it ended. “Did she die there?” she asked him gently. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Only to me,” he said. “In half a year my gold was gone, and I was obliged to take </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">service as a sellsword. While I was fighting Braavosi on the Rhoyne, Lynesse moved into the </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">manse of a merchant prince named Tregar Ormollen. They say she is his chief concubine </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="300" height="15" font="1">now, and even his wife goes in fear of her.” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="275" height="15" font="1">Dany was horrified. “Do you hate her?” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Almost as much as I love her,” Ser Jorah answered. “Pray excuse me, my queen. I find I </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="106" height="15" font="1">am very tired.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She gave him leave to go, but as he was lifting the flap of her tent, she could not stop </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="641" height="15" font="1">herself calling after him with one last question. “What did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah smiled sadly. “Why, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys.” He bowed low. </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">“Sleep well, my queen.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany shivered, and pulled the lionskin tight about her. <i>She looked like me.</i> It explained </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">much that she had not truly understood. <i>He wants me</i>, she realized. <i>He loves me as he loved </i></text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>her, not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman.</i> She tried to imagine herself </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in Ser Jorah’s arms, kissing him, pleasuring him, letting him enter her. It was no good. When </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="389" height="15" font="1">she closed her eyes, his face kept changing into Drogo’s. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Khal Drogo had been her sun-and-stars, her first, and perhaps he must be her last. The </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>maegi</i> Mirri Maz Duur had sworn she should never bear a living child, and what man would </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">want a barren wife? And what man could hope to rival Drogo, who had died with his hair </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">uncut and rode now through the night lands, the stars his <i>khalasar?</i> </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She had heard the longing in Ser Jorah’s voice when he spoke of his Bear Island. <i>He can </i></text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>never have me, but one day I can give him back his home and honor. That much I can do for </i></text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="34" height="15" font="5"><i>him.</i> </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">No ghosts troubled her sleep that night. She dreamed of Drogo and the first ride they had </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">taken together on the night they were wed. In the dream it was not horses they rode, but </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">dragons. </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The next morn, she summoned her bloodriders. “Blood of my blood,” she told the three </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of them, “I have need of you. Each of you is to choose three horses, the hardiest and healthiest </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that remain to us. Load as much water and food as your mounts can bear, and ride forth for </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">me. Aggo shall strike southwest, Rakharo due south. Jhogo, you are to follow <i>shierak qiya</i> on </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="79" height="15" font="1">southeast.” </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="319" height="15" font="1">“What shall we seek, <i>Khaleesi?</i>” asked Jhogo. </text>
</page>
<page number="108" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Whatever there is,” Dany answered. “Seek for other cities, living and dead. Seek for </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">caravans and people. Seek for rivers and lakes and the great salt sea. Find how far this waste </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">extends before us, and what lies on the other side. When I leave this place, I do not mean to </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">strike out blind again. I will know where I am bound, and how best to get there.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And so they went, the bells in their hair ringing softly, while Dany settled down with her </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">small band of survivors in the place they named <i>Vaes Tolorro</i>, the city of bones. Day </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">followed night followed day. Women harvested fruit from the gardens of the dead. Men </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">groomed their mounts and mended saddles, stirrups, and shoes. Children wandered the twisty </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">alleys and found old bronze coins and bits of purple glass and stone flagons with handles </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">carved like snakes. One woman was stung by a red scorpion, but hers was the only death. The </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">horses began to put on some flesh. Dany tended Ser Jorah’s wound herself, and it began to </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">heal. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Rakharo was the first to return. Due south the red waste stretched on and on, he reported, </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water. Between here and there lay only </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">swirling sand, wind-scoured rocks, and plants bristly with sharp thorns. He had passed the </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">jaws. Other than that, he had seen nothing. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany gave him charge of a dozen of her strongest men, and set them to pulling up the </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">plaza to get to the earth beneath. If devilgrass could grow between the paving stones, other </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">grasses would grow when the stones were gone. They had wells enough, no lack of water. </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">Given seed, they could make the plaza bloom. </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Aggo was back next. The southwest was barren and burnt, he swore. He had found the </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ruins of two more cities, smaller than <i>Vaes Tolorro</i> but otherwise the same. One was warded </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears, so he dared not enter, but he had explored </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the second for as long as he could. He showed Dany an iron bracelet he had found, set with a </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">uncut fire opal the size of her thumb. There were scrolls as well, but they were dry and </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="346" height="15" font="1">crumbling and Aggo had left them where they lay. </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany thanked him and told him to see to the repair of the gates. If enemies had crossed </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the waste to destroy these cities in ancient days, they might well come again. “If so, we must </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">be ready,” she declared. </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jhogo was gone so long that Dany feared him lost, but finally when they had all but </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ceased to look for him, he came riding up from the southeast. One of the guards that Aggo </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had posted saw him first and gave a shout, and Dany rushed to the walls to see for herself. It </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was true. Jhogo came, yet not alone. Behind him rode three queerly garbed strangers atop </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">ugly humped creatures that dwarfed any horse. </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They drew rein before the city gates, and looked up to see Dany on the wall above them. </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Blood of my blood,” Jhogo called, “I have been to the great city Qarth, and returned with </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="352" height="15" font="1">three who would look on you with their own eyes.” </text>
<text top="889" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany stared down at the strangers. “Here I stand. Look, if that is your pleasure . . . but </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">first tell me your names.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The pale man with the blue lips replied in guttural Dothraki, “I am Pyat Pree, the great </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="71" height="15" font="1">warlock.” </text>
<text top="978" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The bald man with the jewels in his nose answered in the Valyrian of the Free Cities, “I </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="468" height="15" font="1">am Xaro Xhoan Daxos of the Thirteen, a merchant prince of Qarth.” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The woman in the lacquered wooden mask said in the Common Tongue of the Seven </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">Kingdoms, “I am Quaithe of the Shadow. We come seeking dragons.” </text>

<text top="180" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Whitetree</i>, the village was named on Sam’s old maps. Jon did not think it much of a </text>
<text top="199" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">village. Four tumbledown one-room houses of unmortared stone surrounded an empty </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sheepfold and a well. The houses were roofed with sod, the windows shuttered with ragged </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pieces of hide. And above them loomed the pale limbs and dark red leaves of a monstrous </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="114" height="15" font="1">great weirwood. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">It was the biggest tree Jon Snow had ever seen, the trunk near eight feet wide, the </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">branches spreading so far that the entire village was shaded beneath their canopy. The size did </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not disturb him so much as the face . . . the mouth especially, no simple carved slash, but a </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="330" height="15" font="1">jagged hollow large enough to swallow a sheep. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="513" height="15" font="5"><i>Those are not sheep bones, though. Nor is that a sheep’s skull in the ashes.</i> </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“An old tree.” Mormont sat his horse, frowning. “<i>Old</i>,” his raven agreed from his </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">shoulder. “<i>Old, old, old.</i>” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“And powerful.” Jon could feel the power. </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Thoren Smallwood dismounted beside the trunk, dark in his plate and mail. “Look at that </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">face. Small wonder men feared them, when they first came to Westeros. I’d like to take an axe </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">to the bloody thing myself.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon said, “My lord father believed no man could tell a lie in front of a heart tree. The old </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">gods know when men are lying.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">“My father believed the same,” said the Old Bear. “Let me have a look at that skull.” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon dismounted. Slung across his back in a black leather shoulder sheath was Longclaw, </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the hand-and-a-half bastard blade the Old Bear had given him for saving his life. <i>A bastard </i></text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>sword for a bastard</i>, the men joked. The hilt had been fashioned new for him, adorned with a </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wolf’s-head pommel in pale stone, but the blade itself was Valyrian steel, old and light and </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="96" height="15" font="1">deadly-sharp. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He knelt and reached a gloved hand down into the maw. The inside of the hollow was red </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with dried sap and blackened by fire. Beneath the skull he saw another, smaller, the jaw </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">broken off. It was half-buried in ash and bits of bone. </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When he brought the skull to Mormont, the Old Bear lifted it in both hands and stared </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">into the empty sockets. “The wildlings burn their dead. We’ve always known that. Now I </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="489" height="15" font="1">wished I’d asked them why, when there were still a few around to ask.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon Snow remembered the wight rising, its eyes shining blue in the pale dead face. He </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">knew why, he was certain. </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Would that bones could talk,” the Old Bear grumbled. “This fellow could tell us much. </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">How he died. Who burned him, and why. Where the wildlings have gone.” He sighed. “The </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">children of the forest could speak to the dead, it’s said. But I can’t.” He tossed the skull back </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">into the mouth of the tree, where it landed with a puff of fine ash. “Go through all these </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">houses. Giant, get to the top of this tree, have a look. I’ll have the hounds brought up too. </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Perchance this time the trail will be fresher.” His tone did not suggest that he held out much </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">hope of the last. </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Two men went through each house, to make certain nothing was missed. Jon was paired </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with dour Eddison Tollett, a squire grey of hair and thin as a pike, whom the other brothers </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">called Dolorous Edd. “Bad enough when the dead come walking,” he said to Jon as they </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crossed the village, “now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will come of </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>that</i>, I’ll warrant. And who’s to say the bones wouldn’t lie? Why should death make a man </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely dull fellows, full of tedious complaints—the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">ground’s too cold, my gravestone should be larger, why does <i>he</i> get more worms than I </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon had to stoop to pass through the low door. Within he found a packed-dirt floor. There </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were no furnishings, no sign that people had lived here but for some ashes beneath the smoke </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">hole in the roof. “What a dismal place to live,” he said. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“I was born in a house much like this,” declared Dolorous Edd. “Those were my </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">enchanted years. Later I fell on hard times.” A nest of dry straw bedding filled one corner of </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the room. Edd looked at it with longing. “I’d give all the gold in Casterly Rock to sleep in a </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="82" height="15" font="1">bed again.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="155" height="15" font="1">“You call that a bed?” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If it’s softer than the ground and has a roof over it, I call it a bed.” Dolorous Edd sniffed </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">the air. “I smell dung.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The smell was very faint. “Old dung,” said Jon. The house felt as though it had been </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">empty for some time. Kneeling, he searched through the straw with his hands to see if </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">anything had been concealed beneath, then made a round of the walls. It did not take very </text>

<text top="488" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Nothing was what he had expected; Whitetree was the fourth village they had passed, and </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">it had been the same in all of them. The people were gone, vanished with their scant </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">possessions and whatever animals they may have had. None of the villages showed any signs </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of having been attacked. They were simply . . . empty. “What do you think happened to them </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">all?” Jon asked. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Something worse than we can imagine,” suggested Dolorous Edd. “Well, <i>I</i> might be </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">able to imagine it, but I’d sooner not. Bad enough to know you’re going to come to some </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">awful end without thinking about it aforetime.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Two of the hounds were sniffing around the door as they reemerged. Other dogs ranged </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through the village. Chett was cursing them loudly, his voice thick with the anger he never </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seemed to put aside. The light filtering through the red leaves of the weirwood made the boils </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on his face look even more inflamed than usual. When he saw Jon his eyes narrowed; there </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="217" height="15" font="1">was no love lost between them. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The other houses had yielded no wisdom. “<i>Gone</i>,” cried Mormont’s raven, flapping up </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">into the weirwood to perch above them. “<i>Gone, gone, gone.</i>” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“There were wildlings at Whitetree only a year ago.” Thoren Smallwood looked more a </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">lord than Mormont did, clad in Ser Jaremy Rykker’s gleaming black mail and embossed </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">breastplate. His heavy cloak was richly trimmed with sable, and clasped with the crossed </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hammers of the Rykkers, wrought in silver. Ser Jaremy’s cloak, once . . . but the wight had </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="411" height="15" font="1">claimed Ser Jaremy, and the Night’s Watch wasted nothing. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A year ago Robert was king, and the realm was at peace,” declared Jarman Buckwell, </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">the square stolid man who commanded the scouts. “Much can change in a year’s time.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“One thing hasn’t changed,” Ser Mallador Locke insisted. “Fewer wildlings means fewer </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">worries. I won’t mourn, whatever’s become of them. Raiders and murderers, the lot of them.” </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon heard a rustling from the red leaves above. Two branches parted, and he glimpsed a </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">little man moving from limb to limb as easily as a squirrel. Bedwyck stood no more than five </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">feet tall, but the grey streaks in his hair showed his age. The other rangers called him Giant. </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">He sat in a fork of the tree over their heads and said, “There’s water to the north. A lake, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">might be. A few flint hills rising to the west, not very high. Nothing else to see, my lords.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“We might camp here tonight,” Smallwood suggested. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Old Bear glanced up, searching for a glimpse of sky through the pale limbs and red </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">leaves of the weirwood. “No,” he declared. “Giant, how much daylight remains to us?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="166" height="15" font="1">“Three hours, my lord.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We’ll press on north,” Mormont decided. “If we reach this lake, we can make camp by </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the shore, perchance catch a few fish. Jon, fetch me paper, it’s past time I wrote Maester </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">Aemon.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Jon found parchment, quill, and ink in his saddlebag and brought them to the Lord </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Commander.  <i>At Whitetree</i>, Mormont scrawled. <i>The fourth village. All empty. The wildlings </i></text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>are gone.</i> “Find Tarly and see that he gets this on its way,” he said as he handed Jon the </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">message. When he whistled, his raven came flapping down to land on his horse’s head. </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="415" height="15" font="1">“<i>Corn</i>,” the raven suggested, bobbing. The horse whickered. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jon mounted his garron, wheeled him about, and trotted off. Beyond the shade of the </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">great weirwood the men of the Night’s Watch stood beneath lesser trees, tending their horses, </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chewing strips of salt beef, pissing, scratching, and talking. When the command was given to </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">move out again, the talk died, and they climbed back into their saddles. Jarman Buckwell’s </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scouts rode out first, with the vanguard under Thoren Smallwood heading the column proper. </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Then came the Old Bear with the main force, Ser Mallador Locke with the baggage train and </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">packhorses, and finally Ser Ottyn Wythers and the rear guard. Two hundred men all told, with </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">half again as many mounts. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By day they followed game trails and streambeds, the “ranger’s roads” that led them ever </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">deeper into the wilderness of leaf and root. At night they camped beneath a starry sky and </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gazed up at the comet. The black brothers had left Castle Black in good spirits, joking and </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trading tales, but of late the brooding silence of the wood seemed to have sombered them all. </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jests had grown fewer and tempers shorter. No one would admit to being afraid—they were </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">men of the Night’s Watch, after all—but Jon could feel the unease. Four empty villages, no </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wildlings anywhere, even the game seemingly fled. The haunted forest had never seemed </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="299" height="15" font="1">more haunted, even veteran rangers agreed. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">As he rode, Jon peeled off his glove to air his burned fingers. <i>Ugly things.</i> He </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">remembered suddenly how he used to muss Arya’s hair. His little stick of a sister. He </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wondered how she was faring. It made him a little sad to think that he might never muss her </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hair again. He began to flex his hand, opening and closing the fingers. If he let his sword hand </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stiffen and grow clumsy, it well might be the end of him, he knew. A man needed his sword </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">beyond the Wall. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon found Samwell Tarly with the other stewards, watering his horses. He had three to </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tend: his own mount, and two packhorses, each bearing a large wire-and-wicker cage full of </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ravens. The birds flapped their wings at Jon’s approach and screamed at him through the bars. </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">A few shrieks sounded suspiciously like words. “Have you been teaching them to talk?” he </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">asked Sam. </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="309" height="15" font="1">“A few words. Three of them can say <i>snow</i>.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“One bird croaking my name was bad enough,” said Jon, “and snow’s nothing a black </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="456" height="15" font="1">brother wants to hear about.” Snow often meant death in the north. </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">“Was there anything in Whitetree?” </text>
</page>
<page number="112" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Bones, ashes, and empty houses.” Jon handed Sam the roll of parchment. “The Old Bear </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">wants word sent back to Aemon.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sam took a bird from one of the cages, stroked its feathers, attached the message, and </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">said, “Fly home now, brave one. Home.” The raven <i>quorked</i> something unintelligible back at </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him, and Sam tossed it into the air. Flapping, it beat its way skyward through the trees. “I </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">wish he could carry me with him.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="55" height="15" font="1">“Still?” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Well,”  said  Sam,  “yes,  but . . . I’m  not  as  frightened as I was, truly. The first night, </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">every time I heard someone getting up to make water, I thought it was wildlings creeping in to </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">slit my throat. I was afraid that if I closed my eyes, I might never open them again, </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only . . . well . . . dawn came after all.” He managed a wan smile. “I may be craven, but I’m </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not <i>stupid</i>. I’m sore and my back aches from riding and from sleeping on the ground, but I’m </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hardly scared at all. Look.” He held out a hand for Jon to see how steady it was. “I’ve been </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">working on my maps.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>The world is strange</i>, Jon thought. Two hundred brave men had left the Wall, and the </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">only one who was not growing more fearful was Sam, the self-confessed coward. “We’ll </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">make a ranger of you yet,” he joked. “Next thing, you’ll want to be an outrider like Grenn. </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">Shall I speak to the Old Bear?” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Don’t you dare!” Sam pulled up the hood of his enormous black cloak and clambered </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">awkwardly back onto his horse. It was a plow horse, big and slow and clumsy, but better able </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to bear his weight than the little garrons the rangers rode. “I had hoped we might stay the </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="581" height="15" font="1">night in the village,” he said wistfully. “It would be nice to sleep under a roof again.” </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Too few roofs for all of us.” Jon mounted again, gave Sam a parting smile, and rode off. </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The column was well under way, so he swung wide around the village to avoid the worst of </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">the congestion. He had seen enough of Whitetree. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ghost emerged from the undergrowth so suddenly that the garron shied and reared. The </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">white wolf hunted well away from the line of march, but he was not having much better </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fortune than the foragers Smallwood sent out after game. The woods were as empty as the </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">villages, Dywen had told him one night around the fire. “We’re a large party,” Jon had said. </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="582" height="15" font="1">“The game’s probably been frightened away by all the noise we make on the march.” </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">“Frightened away by <i>something</i>, no doubt,” Dywen said. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Once the horse had settled, Ghost loped along easily beside him. Jon caught up to </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mormont as he was wending his way around a hawthorn thicket. “Is the bird away?” the Old </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">Bear asked. </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="312" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lord. Sam is teaching them to talk.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Old Bear snorted. “He’ll regret that. Damned things make a lot of noise, but they </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">never say a thing worth hearing.” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">They rode in silence, until Jon said, “If my uncle found all these villages empty as well—</text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="12" height="15" font="1">” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“—he would have made it his purpose to learn why,” Lord Mormont finished for him, </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“and it may well be someone or something did not want that known. Well, we’ll be three </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">hundred when Qhorin joins us. Whatever enemy waits out here will not find us so easy to deal </text>

<text top="1020" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="5"><i>Or they will find us</i>, thought Jon. </text>

<text top="149" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shallows along the banks, and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface, ripples </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">spreading out behind it as it went. Overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It seemed a peaceful place . . . until Koss spotted the dead man. “There, in the reeds.” He </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">pointed, and Arya saw it. The body of a soldier, shapeless and swollen. His sodden green </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="634" height="15" font="1">cloak had hung up on a rotted log, and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="579" height="15" font="1">“I told you there was bodies,” Lommy announced. “I could taste them in that water.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When Yoren saw the corpse, he spat. “Dobber, see if he’s got anything worth the taking. </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mail, knife, a bit o’ coin, what have you.” He spurred his gelding and rode out into the river, </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened. Yoren rode </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back angry, his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees. “We won’t be crossing here. </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Koss, you’ll come with me upriver, look for a ford. Woth, Gerren, you go downstream. The </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dobber found a leather purse in the dead man’s belt. Inside were four coppers and a little </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon. Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Mud Pie! Mud Pie!” In the back of their wagon, Rorge cursed and threatened and told them </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to unchain him while Yoren was gone, but no one paid him any mind. Kurz caught a fish with </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his bare hands. Arya saw how he did it, standing over a shallow pool, calm as still water, his </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near. It didn’t look as hard as catching </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="196" height="15" font="1">cats. Fish didn’t have claws. </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was midday when the others returned. Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">downstream, but someone had burned it up. Yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale. “Might be </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">we could swim the horses over, maybe the donkeys, but there’s no way we’ll get those </text>

<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trailing down from it. “That’s Gods Eye, with the river flowing south. We’re here.” He poked </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a hole beside the line of the river, under the circle. “We can’t go round west of the lake, like I </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thought. East takes us back to the kingsroad.” He moved the stick up to where the line and </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">circle met. “Near as I recall, there’s a town here. The holdfast’s stone, and there’s a lordling </text>

<text top="800" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Gods be good, we’ll find a wind and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown.” He thrust the </text>

<text top="889" left="171" width="609" height="15" font="1">Yoren spat. “There’s for your ghosts.” He tossed the stick down in the mud. “Mount up.” </text>
<text top="914" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya was remembering the stories Old Nan used to tell of Harrenhal. Evil King Harren </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had walled himself up inside, so Aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a </text>

<text top="992" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">believe that, and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago. Hot Pie was being silly; it </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">wouldn’t be ghosts at Harrenhal, it would be <i>knights</i>. Arya could reveal herself to Lady </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe. That was what knights did; </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="623" height="15" font="1">they kept you safe, especially women. Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl. </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wagons rolled along smartly. They saw the first house an hour shy of evenfall, a snug little </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thatch-roofed cottage surrounded by fields of wheat. Yoren rode out ahead, hallooing, but got </text>

<text top="285" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A little farther up the road, they glimpsed a forester’s cabin surrounded by old trees and </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting, and later a ramshackle stilt-house leaning over the </text>

<text top="343" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ripening in the sun, but here there were no men sitting in trees, nor walking the rows with </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">scythes. Finally the town came into view; a cluster of white houses spread out around the </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">walls of the holdfast, a big sept with a shingled wooden roof, the lord’s towerhouse sitting on </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">a small rise to the west . . . and no sign of any people, anywhere. </text>
<text top="427" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Yoren sat on his horse, frowning through his tangle of beard. “Don’t like it,” he said, </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“but there it is. We’ll go have us a look. A <i>careful</i> look. See maybe there’s some folk hiding. </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">Might be they left a boat behind, or some weapons we can use.” </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl, and split the </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rest of them into four groups of five to search the town. “Keep your eyes and ears open,” he </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warned them, before he rode off to the towerhouse to see if there was any sign of the lordling </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="96" height="15" font="1">or his guards. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya found herself with Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy. Squat, kettle-bellied Woth had </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pulled an oar on a galley once, which made him the next best thing they had to a sailor, so </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Yoren told him to take them down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat. As they </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">rode between the silent white houses, gooseprickles crawled up Arya’s arms. This empty town </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they’d found the crying girl and the </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything? What </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">could scare them so much? </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The sun was low to the west, and the houses cast long dark shadows. A sudden clap of </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sound made Arya reach for Needle, but it was only a shutter banging in the wind. After the </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="390" height="15" font="1">open river shore, the closeness of the town unnerved her. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees, Arya put her knees into her </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">horse, galloping past Woth and Gendry. She burst out onto the grassy sward beside the </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pebbled shore. The setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beaten copper. It was the biggest lake she had ever seen, with no hint of a far shore. She saw a </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rambling inn to her left, built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings. To her right, a long </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pier jutted into the lake, and there were other docks farther east, wooden fingers reaching out </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">from the town. But the only boat in view was an upside-down rowboat abandoned on the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rocks beneath the inn, its bottom thoroughly rotted out. “They’re gone,” Arya said, dejected. </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">What would they do now? </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“There’s an inn,” Lommy said, when the others rode up. “Do you think they left any </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">food? Or ale?” </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="236" height="15" font="1">“Let’s go see,” Hot Pie suggested. </text>
<text top="1031" left="171" width="563" height="15" font="1">“Never you mind about no inn,” snapped Woth. “Yoren said we’re to find a boat.” </text>
</page>
<page number="115" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They took the boats.” Somehow Arya knew it was true; they could search the whole </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">town, and they’d find no more than the upside-down rowboat. Despondent, she climbed off </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around her legs. A few lantern bugs </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were coming out, their little lights blinking on and off. The green water was warm as tears, </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but there was no salt in it. It tasted of summer and mud and growing things. Arya plunged her </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned back the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt good. She wished she </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could take off her clothes and swim, gliding through the warm water like a skinny pink otter. </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="335" height="15" font="1">Maybe she could swim all the way to Winterfell. </text>
<text top="285" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Woth was shouting at her to help search, so she did, peering into boathouses and sheds </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">while her horse grazed along the shore. They found some sails, some nails, buckets of tar </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">gone hard, and a mother cat with a litter of newborn kittens. But no boats. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The town was as dark as any forest when Yoren and the others reappeared. “Tower’s </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">empty,” he said. “Lord’s gone off to fight maybe, or to get his smallfolk to safety, no telling. </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Not a horse or pig left in town, but we’ll eat. Saw a goose running loose, and some chickens, </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">and there’s good fish in the Gods Eye.” </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“The boats are gone,” Arya reported. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">“We could patch the bottom of that rowboat,” said Koss. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">“Might do for four o’ us,” Yoren said. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There’s nails,” Lommy pointed out. “And there’s trees all around. We could build us all </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">boats.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Yoren spat. “You know anything ‘bout boat-building, dyer’s boy?” Lommy looked </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">blank. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">“A raft,” suggested Gendry. “Anyone can build a raft, and long poles for pushing.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Yoren looked thoughtful. “Lake’s too deep to pole across, but if we stayed to the </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="1">shallows near shore . . . it’d mean leaving the wagons. Might be that’s best. I’ll sleep on it.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="282" height="15" font="1">“Can we stay at the inn?” Lommy asked. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We’ll stay in the holdfast, with the gates barred,” the old man said. “I like the feel o’ </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">stone walls about me when I sleep.” </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya could not keep quiet. “We shouldn’t stay here,” she blurted. “The people didn’t. </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">They all ran off, even their lord.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="375" height="15" font="1">“Arry’s scared,” Lommy announced, braying laughter. </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">“I’m <i>not</i>,” she snapped back, “but <i>they</i> were.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Smart boy,” said Yoren. “Thing is, the folks who lived here were at war, like it or no. </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="449" height="15" font="1">We’re not. Night’s Watch takes no part, so no man’s our enemy.” </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>And no man’s our friend</i>, she thought, but this time she held her tongue. Lommy and the </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="534" height="15" font="1">rest were looking at her, and she did not want to seem craven in front of them. </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The holdfast gates were studded with iron nails. Within, they found a pair of iron bars the </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">size of saplings, with postholes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate. When they </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">announced when they’d explored the holdfast top to bottom, but it was better than most, and </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">should do for a night well enough. The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high, with </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a wooden catwalk inside the battlements. There was a postern gate to the north, and Gerren </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn, leading to a narrow, winding tunnel. </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake. Yoren had them roll a </text>

<page number="116" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wagon on top of the trap, to make certain no one came in that way. He divided them into three </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watches, and sent Tarber, Kurz, and Cutjack off to the abandoned towerhouse to keep an eye </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="499" height="15" font="1">out from on high. Kurz had a hunting horn to sound if danger threatened. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They drove their wagons and animals inside and barred the gates behind them. The barn </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was a ramshackle thing, large enough to hold half the animals in the town. The haven, where </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the townfolk would shelter in times of trouble, was even larger, low and long and built of </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stone, with a thatched roof. Koss went out the postern gate and brought the goose back, and </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">two chickens as well, and Yoren allowed a cookfire. There was a big kitchen inside the </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">holdfast, though all the pots and kettles had been taken. Gendry, Dobber, and Arya drew cook </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">duty. Dobber told Arya to pluck the fowl while Gendry split wood. “Why can’t I split the </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">wood?” she asked, but no one listened. Sullenly, she set to plucking a chicken while Yoren sat </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="499" height="15" font="1">on the end of the bench sharpening the edge of his dirk with a whetstone. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the food was ready, Arya ate a chicken leg and a bit of onion. No one talked much, </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not even Lommy. Gendry went off by himself afterward, polishing his helm with a look on </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his face like he wasn’t even there. The crying girl whimpered and wept, but when Hot Pie </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="462" height="15" font="1">offered her a bit of goose she gobbled it down and looked for more. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya drew second watch, so she found a straw pallet in the haven. Sleep did not come </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">easy, so she borrowed Yoren’s stone and set to honing Needle. Syrio Forel had said that a dull </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blade was like a lame horse. Hot Pie squatted on the pallet beside her, watching her work. </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Where’d you get a good sword like that?” he asked. When he saw the look she gave him, he </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">raised his hands defensively. “I never said you stole it, I just wanted to know where you got it, </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">is all.” </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="288" height="15" font="1">“My brother gave it to me,” she muttered. </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="245" height="15" font="1">“I never knew you had no brother.” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya paused to scratch under her shirt. There were fleas in the straw, though she couldn’t </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="436" height="15" font="1">see why a few more would bother her. “I have lots of brothers.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“You do? Are they bigger than you, or littler?” </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I shouldn’t be talking like this. Yoren said I should keep my mouth shut.</i> “Bigger,” she </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lied. “They have swords too, big longswords, and they showed me how to kill people who </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">bother me.” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I was talking, not bothering.” Hot Pie went off and let her alone and Arya curled up on </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her pallet. She could hear the crying girl from the far side of the haven. <i>I wish she’d just be </i></text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="5"><i>quiet. Why does she have to cry all the time?</i> </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She must have slept, though she never remembered closing her eyes. She dreamed a wolf </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was howling, and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once. Arya sat up on her pallet </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with her heart thumping. “Hot Pie, wake up.” She scrambled to her feet. “Woth, Gendry, </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">didn’t you hear?” She pulled on a boot. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">All around her, men and boys stirred and crawled from their pallets. “What’s wrong?” </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="102" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie asked. </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“Hear what?” Gendry wanted to know. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“Arry had a bad dream,” someone else said. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="272" height="15" font="1">“No, I heard it,” she insisted. “A wolf.” </text>

<text top="1032" left="171" width="442" height="15" font="1">“Let them howl,” Gerren said, “they’re out there, we’re in here.” </text>
<text top="1057" left="171" width="402" height="15" font="1">Woth agreed. “Never saw no wolf could storm a holdfast.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie was saying, “I never heard nothing.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It was a <i>wolf</i>,” she shouted at them as she yanked on her second boot. “Something’s </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">wrong, someone’s coming, get <i>up!</i>” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Before they could hoot her down again, the sound came shuddering through the night—</text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only it was no wolf this time, it was Kurz blowing his hunting horn, sounding danger. In a </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">heartbeat, all of them were pulling on clothes and snatching for whatever weapons they </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">owned. Arya ran for the gate as the horn sounded again. As she dashed past the barn, Biter </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">threw himself furiously against his chains, and Jaqen H’ghar called out from the back of their </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">wagon. “Boy! Sweet boy! Is it war, red war? Boy, free us. A man can fight. <i>Boy!</i>” She </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="599" height="15" font="1">ignored him and plunged on. By then she could hear horses and shouts beyond the wall. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She scrambled up onto the catwalk. The parapets were a bit too high and Arya a bit too </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">short; she had to wedge her toes into the holes between the stones to see over. For a moment </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she thought the town was full of lantern bugs. Then she realized they were men with torches, </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">galloping between the houses. She saw a roof go up, flames licking at the belly of the night </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with hot orange tongues as the thatch caught. Another followed, and then another, and soon </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="251" height="15" font="1">there were fires blazing everywhere. </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="439" height="15" font="1">Gendry climbed up beside her, wearing his helm. “How many?” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flung them. “A hundred,” she said. “Two hundred, I don’t know.” Over the roar of the flames, </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="348" height="15" font="1">she could hear shouts. “They’ll come for us soon.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="219" height="15" font="1">“There,” Gendry said, pointing. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A column of riders moved between the burning buildings toward the holdfast. Firelight </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">glittered off metal helms and spattered their mail and plate with orange and yellow highlights. </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">One carried a banner on a tall lance. She thought it was red, but it was hard to tell in the night, </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="516" height="15" font="1">with the fires roaring all around. Everything seemed red or black or orange. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The fire leapt from one house to another. Arya saw a tree consumed, the flames creeping </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">across its branches until it stood against the night in robes of living orange. Everyone was </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">awake now, manning the catwalks or struggling with the frightened animals below. She could </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hear Yoren shouting commands. Something bumped against her leg, and she glanced down to </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">discover the crying girl clutching her. “Get away!” She wrenched her leg free. “What are you </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="545" height="15" font="1">doing up here? Run and hide someplace, you stupid.” She shoved the girl away. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The riders reined up before the gates. “<i>You in the holdfast!</i>” shouted a knight in a tall </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="398" height="15" font="1">helm with a spiked crest. “<i>Open, in the name of the king!</i>” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aye, and which king is that?” old Reysen yelled back down, before Woth cuffed him </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="86" height="15" font="1">into silence. </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Yoren climbed the battlement beside the gate, his faded black cloak tied to a wooden </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">staff. “<i>You men hold down here!</i>” he shouted. “<i>The townfolk’s gone.</i>” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And who are you, old man? One of Lord Beric’s cravens?” called the knight in the </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">spiked helm. “If that fat fool Thoros is in there, ask him how he likes <i>these</i> fires.” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Got no such man here,” Yoren shouted back. “Only some lads for the Watch. Got no </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">part o’ your war.” He hoisted up the staff, so they could all see the color of his cloak. “Have a </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="295" height="15" font="1">look. That’s black, for the Night’s Watch.” </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Or black for House Dondarrion,” called the man who bore the enemy banner. Arya </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could see its colors more clearly now in the light of the burning town: a golden lion on red. </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">“Lord Beric’s sigil is a purple lightning bolt on a black field.” </text>
</page>
<page number="118" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Suddenly Arya remembered the morning she had thrown the orange in Sansa’s face and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gotten juice all over her stupid ivory silk gown. There had been some southron lordling at the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tourney, her sister’s stupid friend Jeyne was in love with him. He had a lightning bolt on his </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shield and her father had sent him out to behead the Hound’s brother. It seemed a thousand </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">years ago now, something that had happened to a different person in a different life . . . to </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Arya Stark the Hand’s daughter, not Arry the orphan boy. How would Arry know lords and </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="1">such? </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Are you blind, man?” Yoren waved his staff back and forth, making the cloak ripple. </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">“You see a bloody lightning bolt?” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“By night all banners look black,” the knight in the spiked helm observed. “Open, or </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">we’ll know you for outlaws in league with the king’s enemies.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="287" height="15" font="1">Yoren spat. “Who’s got your command?” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I do.” The reflections of burning houses glimmered dully on the armor of his warhorse </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as the others parted to let him pass. He was a stout man with a manticore on his shield, and </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ornate scrollwork crawling across his steel breastplate. Through the open visor of his helm, a </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">face pale and piggy peered up. “Ser Amory Lorch, bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister of </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Casterly Rock, the Hand of the King. The <i>true</i> king, Joffrey.” He had a high, thin voice. “In </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">his name, I command you to open these gates.” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">All around them, the town burned. The night air was full of smoke, and the drifting red </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">embers outnumbered the stars. Yoren scowled. “Don’t see the need. Do what you want to the </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">town, it’s naught to me, but leave us be. We’re no foes to you.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Look with your eyes</i>, Arya wanted to shout at the men below. “Can’t they see we’re no </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">lords or knights?” she whispered. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="384" height="15" font="1">“I don’t think they care, Arry,” Gendry whispered back. </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And she looked at Ser Amory’s face, the way Syrio had taught her to look, and she saw </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">that he was right. </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If you are no traitors, open your gates,” Ser Amory called. “We’ll make certain you’re </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="233" height="15" font="1">telling it true and be on our way.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="599" height="15" font="1">Yoren was chewing sourleaf. “Told you, no one here but us. You got my word on that.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="479" height="15" font="1">The knight in the spiked helm laughed. “The crow gives us his <i>word</i>.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You lost, old man?” mocked one of the spearmen. “The Wall’s a long way north o’ </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">here.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I command you once more, in King Joffrey’s name, to prove the loyalty you profess and </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">open these gates,” said Ser Amory. </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="565" height="15" font="1">For a long moment Yoren considered, chewing. Then he spat. “Don’t think I will.” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“So be it. You defy the king’s command, and so proclaim yourselves rebels, black cloaks </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">or no.” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="357" height="15" font="1">“Got me young boys in here,” Yoren shouted down. </text>
<text top="940" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Young boys and old men die the same.” Ser Amory raised a languid fist, and a spear </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">came hurtling from the fire-bright shadows behind. Yoren must have been the target, but it </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was Woth beside him who was hit. The spearhead went in his throat and exploded out the </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="620" height="15" font="1">back of his neck, dark and wet. Woth grabbed at the shaft, and fell boneless from the walk. </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Storm the walls and kill them all,” Ser Amory said in a bored voice. More spears flew. </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Arya yanked down Hot Pie by the back of his tunic. From outside came the rattle of armor, </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the scrape of swords on scabbards, the banging of spears on shields, mingled with curses and </text>

<page number="119" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the hoofbeats of racing horses. A torch sailed spinning above their heads, trailing fingers of </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">fire as it thumped down in the dirt of the yard. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Blades!</i>” Yoren shouted. “Spread apart, defend the wall wherever they hit. Koss, Urreg, </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">hold the postern. Lommy, pull that spear out of Woth and get up where he was.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie dropped his shortsword when he tried to unsheath it. Arya shoved the blade back </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="481" height="15" font="1">into his hand. “I don’t know how to sword-fight,” he said, white-eyed. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It’s easy,” Arya said, but the lie died in her throat as a <i>hand</i> grasped the top of the </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">parapet. She saw it by the light of the burning town, so clear that it was as if time had stopped. </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The fingers were blunt, callused, wiry black hairs grew between the knuckles, there was dirt </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">under the nail of the thumb. <i>Fear cuts deeper than swords</i>, she remembered as the top of a </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">pot-helm loomed up behind the hand. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She slashed down hard, and Needle’s castle-forged steel bit into the grasping fingers </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">between the knuckles. “<i>Winterfell!</i>” she screamed. Blood spurted, fingers flew, and the </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">helmed face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Behind!” Hot Pie yelled. Arya whirled. The second man was bearded and helmetless, </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing. As he swung his leg over the </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">parapet, she drove her point at his eyes. Needle never touched him; he reeled backward and </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="371" height="15" font="1">fell. <i>I hope he falls on his face and cuts off his tongue.</i> </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Watch <i>them</i>, not me!” she screamed at Hot Pie. The next time someone tried to climb </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their part of the wall, the boy hacked at his hands with his shortsword until the man dropped </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">away. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Amory had no ladders, but the holdfast walls were rough-cut and unmortared, easy to </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">climb, and there seemed to be no end to the foes. For each one Arya cut or stabbed or shoved </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back, another was coming over the wall. The knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart, </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but Yoren tangled his black banner around his spike, and forced the point of his dirk through </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his armor while the man was fighting the cloth. Every time Arya looked up, more torches </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were flying, trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind her eyes. She saw a gold lion </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">on a red banner and thought of Joffrey, wishing he was here so she could drive Needle </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through his sneery face. When four men assaulted the gate with axes, Koss shot them down </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with arrows, one by one. Dobber wrestled a man off the walk, and Lommy smashed his head </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with a rock before he could rise, and hooted until he saw the knife in Dobber’s belly and </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">realized he wouldn’t be getting up either. Arya jumped over a dead boy no older than Jon, </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lying with his arm cut off. She didn’t think she’d done it, but she wasn’t sure. She heard Qyle </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on his shield smashed his face in with a spiked </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mace. Everything smelled of blood and smoke and iron and piss, but after a time it seemed </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like that was only one smell. She never saw how the skinny man got over the wall, but when </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he did she fell on him with Gendry and Hot Pie. Gendry’s sword shattered on the man’s helm, </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tearing it off his head. Underneath he was bald and scared-looking, with missing teeth and a </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">speckly grey beard, but even as she was feeling sorry for him she was killing him, shouting, </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“<i>Winterfell! Winterfell!</i>” while Hot Pie screamed “<i>Hot Pie!</i>” beside her as he hacked at the </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">man’s scrawny neck. </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the skinny man was dead, Gendry stole his sword and leapt down into the yard to </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fight some more. Arya looked past him, and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast, </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">firelight shining off mail and blades, and she knew that they’d gotten over the wall </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">somewhere, or broken through at the postern. She jumped down beside Gendry, landing the </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">way Syrio had taught her. The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">around her. </text>
</page>
<page number="120" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. “<i>Boy!</i>” he yelled, the way </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he always yelled it. “Get <i>out</i>, it’s done, we’ve lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="1">others, the boys, you get them out. <i>Now!</i>” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="133" height="15" font="1">“How?” Arya said. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="303" height="15" font="1">“That trap,” he screamed. “Under the barn.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Quick as that he was gone, off to fight, sword in hand. Arya grabbed Gendry by the arm. </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“He said go,” she shouted, “the barn, the way out.” Through the slits of his helm, the Bull’s </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eyes shone with reflected fire. He nodded. They called Hot Pie down from the wall and found </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear thrust through his calf. They found </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gerren too, but he was hurt too bad to move. As they were running toward the barn, Arya </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded by smoke and slaughter. </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead. The girl </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wouldn’t walk, even when slapped. Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Needle in the left. Ahead, the night was a sullen red. <i>The barn’s on fire</i>, she thought. Flames </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">were licking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw, and she could hear the </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">screaming of the animals trapped within. Hot Pie stepped out of the barn. “<i>Arry, come on!</i> </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">Lommy’s <i>gone</i>, leave her if she won’t come!” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stubbornly, Arya dragged all the harder, pulling the crying girl along. Hot Pie scuttled </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">back inside, abandoning them . . . but Gendry came back, the fire shining so bright on his </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">polished helm that the horns seemed to glow orange. He ran to them, and hoisted the crying </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">girl up over his shoulder. “<i>Run!</i>” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Rushing through the barn doors was like running into a furnace. The air was swirling </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with smoke, the back wall a sheet of fire ground to roof. Their horses and donkeys were </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">kicking and rearing and screaming. <i>The poor animals</i>, Arya thought. Then she saw the wagon, </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and the three men manacled to its bed. Biter was flinging himself against the chains, blood </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">running down his arms from where the irons clasped his wrists. Rorge screamed curses, </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="435" height="15" font="1">kicking at the wood. “Boy!” called Jaqen H’ghar. “Sweet boy!” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The open trap was only a few feet ahead, but the fire was spreading fast, consuming the </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">old wood and dry straw faster than she would have believed. Arya remembered the Hound’s </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">horrible burned face. “Tunnel’s narrow,” Gendry shouted. “How do we get her through?” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“Pull her,” Arya said. “Push her.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“Good boys, kind boys,” called Jaqen H’ghar, coughing. </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">“<i>Get these fucking chains off!</i>” Rorge screamed. </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="542" height="15" font="1">Gendry ignored them. “You go first, then her, then me. Hurry, it’s a long way.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="565" height="15" font="1">“When you split the firewood,” Arya remembered, “where did you leave the axe?” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Out by the haven.” He spared a glance for the chained men. “I’d save the donkeys first. </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">There’s no time.” </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You take her!” she yelled. “You get her out! You do it!” The fire beat at her back with </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hot red wings as she fled the burning barn. It felt blessedly cool outside, but men were dying </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all around her. She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield, and she saw them kill him where </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he stood. Smoke was everywhere. There was no sign of Yoren, but the axe was where Gendry </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had left it, by the woodpile outside the haven. As she wrenched it free, a mailed hand grabbed </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her arm. Spinning, Arya drove the head of the axe hard between his legs. She never saw his </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face, only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk. Going back into that barn </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was the hardest thing she ever did. Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">snake, and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and </text>

<page number="121" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">men. She chewed her lip, and darted through the doors, crouched low where the smoke wasn’t </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">quite so thick. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A donkey was caught in a ring of fire, shrieking in terror and pain. She could smell the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stench of burning hair. The roof was gone up too, and things were falling down, pieces of </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">flaming wood and bits of straw and hay. Arya put a hand over her mouth and nose. She </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">couldn’t see the wagon for the smoke, but she could still hear Biter screaming. She crawled </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">toward the sound. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And then a wheel was looming over her. The wagon <i>jumped</i> and moved a half foot when </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Biter threw himself against his chains again. Jaqen saw her, but it was too hard to breathe, let </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">alone talk. She threw the axe into the wagon. Rorge caught it and lifted it over his head, rivers </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of sooty sweat pouring down his noseless face. Arya was running, coughing. She heard the </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steel crash through the old wood, and again, again. An instant later came a <i>crack</i> as loud as </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="584" height="15" font="1">thunder, and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she didn’t care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life. Under the </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smoke and the screams of dying horses. She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">cried. For whom, she could not say. </text>

<text top="611" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The queen was not disposed to wait on Varys. “Treason is vile enough,” she declared </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">furiously, “but this is barefaced naked villainy, and I do not need that mincing eunuch to tell </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">me what must be done with villains.” </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion took the letters from his sister’s hand and compared them side by side. There </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">were two copies, the words exactly alike, though they had been written by different hands. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Maester Frenken received the first missive at Castle Stokeworth,” Grand Maester </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="1">Pycelle explained. “The second copy came through Lord Gyles.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger fingered his beard. “If Stannis bothered with <i>them</i>, it’s past certain every </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">other lord in the Seven Kingdoms saw a copy as well.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I want these letters burned, every one,” Cersei declared. “No hint of this must reach my </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">son’s ears, or my father’s.” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I imagine Father’s heard rather more than a hint by now,” Tyrion said dryly. “Doubtless </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stannis sent a bird to Casterly Rock, and another to Harrenhal. As for burning the letters, to </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">what point? The song is sung, the wine is spilled, the wench is pregnant. And this is not as </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">dire as it seems, in truth.” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei turned on him in green-eyed fury. “Are you utterly witless? Did you read what he </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">says?  <i>The boy Joffrey</i>, he calls him. And he dares to accuse <i>me</i> of incest, adultery, and </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">treason!” </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Only because you’re guilty.</i> It was astonishing to see how angry Cersei could wax over </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">accusations she knew perfectly well to be true. <i>If we lose the war, she ought to take up </i></text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>mummery, she has a gift for it.</i> Tyrion waited until she was done and said, “Stannis must have </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">some pretext to justify his rebellion. What did you expect him to write? ‘Joffrey is my </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="271" height="15" font="1">“I will not suffer to be called a whore!” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Why, sister, he never claims Jaime paid you.</i> Tyrion made a show of glancing over the </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">writing again. There had been some niggling phrase . . . “Done in the Light of the Lord,” he </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="262" height="15" font="1">read. “A queer choice of words, that.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Pycelle cleared his throat. “These words often appear in letters and documents from the </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Free Cities. They mean no more than, let us say, <i>written in the sight of god</i>. The god of the red </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">priests. It is their usage, I do believe.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Varys told us some years past that Lady Selyse had taken up with a red priest,” </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger reminded them. </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion tapped the paper. “And now it would seem her lord husband has done the same. </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">We can use that against him. Urge the High Septon to reveal how Stannis has turned against </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">the gods as well as his rightful king . . .” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes, yes,” the queen said impatiently, “but first we must stop this filth from spreading </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">further. The council must issue an edict. Any man heard speaking of incest or calling Joff a </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">bastard should lose his tongue for it.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“A prudent measure,” said Grand Maester Pycelle, his chain of office clinking as he </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">nodded. </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A folly,” sighed Tyrion. “When you tear out a man’s tongue, you are not proving him a </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">liar, you’re only telling the world that you fear what he might say.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="376" height="15" font="1">“So what would <i>you</i> have us do?” his sister demanded. </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Very little. Let them whisper, they’ll grow bored with the tale soon enough. Any man </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with a thimble of sense will see it for a clumsy attempt to justify usurping the crown. Does </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Stannis offer proof? How could he, when it never happened?” Tyrion gave his sister his </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">sweetest smile. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="263" height="15" font="1">“That’s so,” she had to say. “Still . . .” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace, your brother has the right of this.” Petyr Baelish steepled his fingers. “If we </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">attempt to silence this talk, we only lend it credence. Better to treat it with contempt, like the </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="359" height="15" font="1">pathetic lie it is. And meantime, fight fire with fire.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="378" height="15" font="1">Cersei gave him a measuring look. “What sort of fire?” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. But more easily believed. Lord Stannis </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">has spent most of his marriage apart from his wife. Not that I fault him, I’d do the same were I </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">married to Lady Selyse. Nonetheless, if we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stannis a cuckold, well . . . the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="502" height="15" font="1">particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He has never been much loved, that’s true.” Cersei considered a moment. “So we pay </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him back in his own coin. Yes, I like this. Who can we name as Lady Selyse’s lover? She has </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">two brothers, I believe. And one of her uncles has been with her on Dragonstone all this </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">time . . .” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Ser Axell Florent is her castellan.” Loath as Tyrion was to admit it, Littlefinger’s </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">scheme had promise. Stannis had never been enamored of his wife, but he was bristly as a </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hedgehog where his honor was concerned and mistrustful by nature. If they could sow discord </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">between him and his followers, it could only help their cause. “The child has the Florent ears, </text>

</page>
<page number="123" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger gestured languidly. “A trade envoy from Lys once observed to me that Lord </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Stannis must love his daughter very well, since he’d erected hundreds of statues of her all </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">along the walls of Dragonstone. ‘My lord’ I had to tell him, ‘those are gargoyles.’” He </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chuckled. “Ser Axell might serve for Shireen’s father, but in my experience, the more bizarre </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be repeated. Stannis keeps an especially grotesque </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="251" height="15" font="1">fool, a lackwit with a tattooed face.” </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Grand Maester Pycelle gaped at him, aghast. “Surely you do not mean to suggest that </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">Lady Selyse would bring a <i>fool</i> into her bed?” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You’d have to be a fool to want to bed Selyse Florent,” said Littlefinger. “Doubtless </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Patchface reminded her of Stannis. And the best lies contain within them nuggets of truth, </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">enough to give a listener pause. As it happens, this fool is utterly devoted to the girl and </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">follows her everywhere. They even look somewhat alike. Shireen has a mottled, half-frozen </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="96" height="15" font="1">face as well.” </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Pycelle was lost. “But that is from the greyscale that near killed her as a babe, poor </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">thing.” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I like my tale better,” said Littlefinger, “and so will the smallfolk. Most of them believe </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="1">that if a woman eats rabbit while pregnant, her child will be born with long floppy ears.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei smiled the sort of smile she customarily reserved for Jaime. “Lord Petyr, you are a </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="124" height="15" font="1">wicked creature.” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="184" height="15" font="1">“Thank you, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And a most accomplished liar,” Tyrion added, less warmly. <i>This one is more dangerous </i></text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="5"><i>than I knew</i>, he reflected. </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger’s grey-green eyes met the dwarf’s mismatched stare with no hint of unease. </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">“We all have our gifts, my lord.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The queen was too caught up in her revenge to take note of the exchange. “Cuckolded by </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="598" height="15" font="1">a halfwit fool! Stannis will be laughed at in every winesink this side of the narrow sea.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The story should not come from us,” Tyrion said, “or it will be seen for a self-serving </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">lie.” <i>Which it is, to be sure.</i> </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Once more Littlefinger supplied the answer. “Whores love to gossip, and as it happens I </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">own a brothel or three. And no doubt Varys can plant seeds in the alehouses and pot-shops.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“Varys,” Cersei said, frowning. “Where <i>is</i> Varys?” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“I have been wondering about that myself, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The Spider spins his secret webs day and night,” Grand Maester Pycelle said ominously. </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">“I mistrust that one, my lords.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And he speaks so kindly of you.” Tyrion pushed himself off his chair. As it happened, </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he knew what the eunuch was about, but it was nothing the other councilors needed to hear. </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">“Pray excuse me, my lords. Other business calls.” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="354" height="15" font="1">Cersei was instantly suspicious. “King’s business?” </text>
<text top="940" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">“Nothing you need trouble yourself about.” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="179" height="15" font="1">“I’ll be the judge of that.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Would you spoil my surprise?” Tyrion said. “I’m having a gift made for Joffrey. A little </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">chain.” </text>
<text top="1035" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What does he need with another chain? He has gold chains and silver, more than he can </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">wear. If you think for a moment you can buy Joff’s love with gifts—” </text>

<page number="124" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why, surely I <i>have</i> the king’s love, as he has mine. And <i>this</i> chain I believe he may one </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">day treasure above all others.” The little man bowed and waddled to the door. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bronn was waiting outside the council chambers to escort him back to the Tower of the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Hand. “The smiths are in your audience chamber, waiting your pleasure,” he said as they </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="122" height="15" font="1">crossed the ward. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Waiting my pleasure. I like the ring of that, Bronn. You almost sound a proper courtier. </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">Next you’ll be kneeling.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="135" height="15" font="1">“Fuck you, dwarf.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That’s Shae’s task.” Tyrion heard Lady Tanda calling to him merrily from the top of the </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">serpentine steps. Pretending not to notice her, he waddled a bit faster. “See that my litter is </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">readied, I’ll be leaving the castle as soon as I’m done here.” Two of the Moon Brothers had </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the door guard. Tyrion greeted them pleasantly, and grimaced before starting up the stairs. </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="338" height="15" font="1">The climb to his bedchamber made his legs ache. </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Within he found a boy of twelve laying out clothing on the bed; his squire, such that he </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">was. Podrick Payne was so shy he was furtive. Tyrion had never quite gotten over the </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="429" height="15" font="1">suspicion that his father had inflicted the boy on him as a joke. </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your garb, my lord,” the boy mumbled when Tyrion entered, staring down at his boots. </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Even when he worked up the courage to speak, Pod could never quite manage to look at you. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">“For the audience. And your chain. The Hand’s chain.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Very good. Help me dress.” The doublet was black velvet covered with golden studs in </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the shape of lions’ heads, the chain a loop of solid gold hands, the fingers of each clasping the </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrist of the next. Pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold, cut to his height. </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="384" height="15" font="1">On a normal man, it would be no more than a half-cape. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Hand’s private audience chamber was not so large as the king’s, nor a patch on the </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">vastness of the throne room, but Tyrion liked its Myrish rugs, wall hangings, and sense of </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">intimacy. As he entered, his steward cried out, “Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King.” He </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">liked that too. The gaggle of smiths, armorers, and ironmongers that Bronn had collected fell </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">to their knees. </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He hoisted himself up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid them </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rise. “Goodmen, I know you are all busy, so I will be succinct. Pod, if you please.” The boy </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">handed him a canvas sack. Tyrion yanked the drawstring and upended the bag. Its contents </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">spilled onto the rug with a muffled <i>thunk</i> of metal on wool. “I had these made at the castle </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="316" height="15" font="1">forge. I want a thousand more just like them.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One of the smiths knelt to inspect the object: three immense steel links, twisted together. </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="129" height="15" font="1">“A mighty chain.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Mighty, but short,” the dwarf replied. “Somewhat like me. I fancy one a good deal </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">longer. Do you have a name?” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They call me Ironbelly, m’lord.” The smith was squat and broad, plainly dressed in </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="415" height="15" font="1">wool and leather, but his arms were as thick as a bull’s neck. </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I want every forge in King’s Landing turned to making these links and joining them. All </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">other work is to be put aside. I want every man who knows the art of working metal set to this </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">task, be he master, journeyman, or apprentice. When I ride up the Street of Steel, I want to </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hear hammers ringing, night or day. And I want a man, a strong man, to see that all this is </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">done. Are you that man, Goodman Ironbelly?” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">“Might be I am, m’lord. But what of the mail and swords the queen was wanting?” </text>
</page>
<page number="125" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Another smith spoke up. “Her Grace commanded us to make chain-mail and armor, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">swords and daggers and axes, all in great numbers. For arming her new gold cloaks, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="363" height="15" font="1">“That work can wait,” Tyrion said. “The chain first.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“M’lord, begging your pardon, Her Grace said those as didn’t meet their numbers would </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">have their hands crushed,” the anxious Smith persisted. “Smashed on their own anvils, she </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="1">said.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Sweet Cersei, always striving to make the smallfolk love us.</i> “No one will have their </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">hands smashed. You have my word on it.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Iron is grown dear,” Ironbelly declared, “and this chain will be needing much of it, and </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">coke beside, for the fires.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lord Baelish will see that you have coin as you need it,” Tyrion promised. He could </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">count on Littlefinger for that much, he hoped. “I will command the City Watch to help you </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="428" height="15" font="1">find iron. Melt down every horseshoe in this city if you must.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">An older man moved forward, richly dressed in a damask tunic with silver fastenings and </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a cloak lined with fox-fur. He knelt to examine the great steel links Tyrion had dumped on the </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">floor. “My lord,” he announced gravely, “this is crude work at best. There is no art to it. </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Suitable labor for common smiths, no doubt, for men who bend horseshoes and hammer out </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kettles, but I am a master armorer, as it please my lord. This is no work for me, nor my fellow </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">masters. We make swords as sharp as song, armor such as a god might wear. Not <i>this</i>.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion tilted his head to the side and gave the man a dose of his mismatched eyes. “What </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="218" height="15" font="1">is your name, master armorer?” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Salloreon, as it please my lord. If the King’s Hand will permit, I should be <i>most</i> honored </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">to forge him a suit of armor suitable to his House and high office.” Two of the others </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sniggered, but Salloreon plunged ahead, heedless. “Plate and scale, I think. The scales gilded </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bright as the sun, the plate enameled a deep Lannister crimson. I would suggest a demon’s </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">head for a helm, crowned with tall golden horns. When you ride into battle, men will shrink </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">away in fear.” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="5"><i>A demon’s head</i>, Tyrion thought ruefully, <i>now what does that say of me?</i> “Master </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Salloreon, I plan to fight the rest of my battles from this chair. It’s links I need, not demon </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">horns. So let me put it to you this way. You will make chains, or you will wear them. The </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">choice is yours.” He rose, and took his leave with nary a backward glance. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bronn was waiting by the gate with his litter and an escort of mounted Black Ears. “You </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">know where we’re bound,” Tyrion told him. He accepted a hand up into the litter. He had </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">done all he could to feed the hungry city—he’d set several hundred carpenters to building </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">fishing boats in place of catapults, opened the kingswood to any hunter who dared to cross the </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">river, even sent gold cloaks foraging to the west and south—yet he still saw accusing eyes </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">everywhere he rode. The litter’s curtains shielded him from that, and besides gave him leisure </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="61" height="15" font="1">to think. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As they wound their slow way down twisty Shadowblack Lane to the foot of Aegon’s </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">High Hill, Tyrion reflected on the events of the morning. His sister’s ire had led her to </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">overlook the true significance of Stannis Baratheon’s letter. Without proof, his accusations </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were nothing; what mattered was that he had named himself a king. <i>And what will Renly make </i></text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="5"><i>of that?</i> They could not <i>both</i> sit the Iron Throne. </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Idly, he pushed the curtain back a few inches to peer out at the streets. Black Ears rode </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on both sides of him, their grisly necklaces looped about their throats, while Bronn went in </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">front to clear the way. He watched the passersby watching him, and played a little game with </text>

<page number="126" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself, trying to sort the informers from the rest. <i>The ones who look the most suspicious are </i></text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="5"><i>likely innocent</i>, he decided. <i>It’s the ones who look innocent I need to beware.</i> </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His destination was behind the hill of Rhaenys, and the streets were crowded. Almost an </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hour had passed before the litter swayed to a stop. Tyrion was dozing, but he woke abruptly </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when the motion ceased, rubbed the sand from his eyes, and accepted Bronn’s hand to climb </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">down. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The house was two stories tall, stone below and timber above. A round turret rose from </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">one corner of the structure. Many of the windows were leaded. Over the door swung an ornate </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">lamp, a globe of gilded metal and scarlet glass. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="397" height="15" font="1">“A brothel,” Bronn said. “What do you mean to do here?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="283" height="15" font="1">“What does one usually do in a brothel?” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">The sellsword laughed. “Shae’s not enough?” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She was pretty enough for a camp follower, but I’m no longer in camp. Little men have </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="401" height="15" font="1">big appetites, and I’m told the girls here are fit for a king.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="174" height="15" font="1">“Is the boy old enough?” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Not Joffrey. Robert. This house was a great favorite of his.” <i>Although Joffrey may </i></text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>indeed be old enough. An interesting notion, that.</i> “If you and the Black Ears care to amuse </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yourselves, feel free, but Chataya’s girls are costly. You’ll find cheaper houses all along the </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">street. Leave one man here who’ll know where to find the others when I wish to return.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="413" height="15" font="1">Bronn nodded. “As you say.” The Black Ears were all grins. </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Inside the door, a tall woman in flowing silks was waiting for him. She had ebon skin </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">and sandalwood eyes. “I am Chataya,” she announced, bowing deeply. “And you are—” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let us not get into the habit of names. Names are dangerous.” The air smelled of some </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">exotic spice, and the floor beneath his feet displayed a mosaic of two women entwined in </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">love. “You have a pleasant establishment.” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I have labored long to make it so. I am glad the Hand is pleased.” Her voice was </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">flowing amber, liquid with the accents of the distant Summer Isles. </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="593" height="15" font="1">“Titles can be as dangerous as names,” Tyrion warned. “Show me a few of your girls.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It will be my great delight. You will find that they are all as sweet as they are beautiful, </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and skilled in every art of love.” She swept off gracefully, leaving Tyrion to waddle after as </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">best he could on legs half the length of hers. </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">From behind an ornate Myrish screen carved with flowers and fancies and dreaming </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">maidens, they peered unseen into a common room where an old man was playing a cheerful </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">air on the pipes. In a cushioned alcove, a drunken Tyroshi with a purple beard dandled a </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">buxom young wench on his knee. He’d unlaced her bodice and was tilting his cup to pour a </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thin trickle of wine over her breasts so he might lap it off. Two other girls sat playing at tiles </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">before a leaded glass window. The freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in her honeyed </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hair. The other had skin as smooth and black as polished jet, wide dark eyes, small pointed </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">breasts. They dressed in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts. The sunlight </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pouring through the colored glass outlined their sweet young bodies through the thin cloth, </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Tyrion felt a stirring in his groin. “I would respectfully suggest the dark-skinned girl,” </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="96" height="15" font="1">said Chataya. </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“She’s young.” </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">even younger. Tyrion remembered how shy she’d seemed as he drew her dress up over her </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">head the first time. Long dark hair and blue eyes you could drown in, and he had. So long </text>

<text top="207" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Her blood is the blood of summer, my lord, but my daughter was born here in King’s </text>

<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that there is no shame to be found in the pillow house. In the Summer Isles, those who are </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">skilled at giving pleasure are greatly esteemed. Many highborn youths and maidens serve for </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">a few years after their flowerings, to honor the gods.” </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“What do the gods have to do with it?” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The gods made our bodies as well as our souls, is it not so? They give us voices, so we </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">might worship them with song. They give us hands, so we might build them temples. And </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">they give us desire, so we might mate and worship them in that way.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Remind me to tell the High Septon,” said Tyrion. “If I could pray with my cock, I’d be </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="547" height="15" font="1">much more religious.” He waved a hand. “I will gladly accept your suggestion.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="266" height="15" font="1">“I shall summon my daughter. Come.” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The girl met him at the foot of the stairs. Taller than Shae, though not so tall as her </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mother, she had to kneel before Tyrion could kiss her. “My name is Alayaya,” she said, with </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">only the slightest hint of her mother’s accent. “Come, my lord.” She took him by the hand and </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drew him up two flights of stairs, then down a long hall. Gasps and shrieks of pleasure were </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">coming from behind one of the closed doors, giggles and whispers from another. Tyrion’s </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cock pressed against the lacings of his breeches. <i>This could be humiliating</i>, he thought as he </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">followed Alayaya up another stair to the turret room. There was only one door. She led him </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through and closed it. Within the room was a great canopied bed, a tall wardrobe decorated </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with erotic carvings, and a narrow window of leaded glass in a pattern of red and yellow </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">diamonds. </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You are very beautiful, Alayaya,” Tyrion told her when they were alone. “From head to </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">heels, every part of you is lovely. Yet just now the part that interests me most is your tongue.” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My lord will find my tongue well schooled. When I was a girl I learned when to use it, </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">and when not.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That pleases me.” Tyrion smiled. “So what shall we do now? Perchance you have some </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="92" height="15" font="1">suggestion?” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="550" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” she said. “If my lord will open the wardrobe, he will find what he seeks.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion kissed her hand, and climbed inside the empty wardrobe. Alayaya closed it after </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. He groped for the back panel, felt it slide under his fingers, and pushed it all the way </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">aside. The hollow space behind the walls was pitch-black, but he fumbled until he felt metal. </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">His hand closed around the rung of a ladder. He found a lower rung with his foot, and started </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">down. Well below street level, the shaft opened onto a slanting earthen tunnel, where he </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">found Varys waiting with candle in hand. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys did not look at all like himself. A scarred face and a stubble of dark beard showed </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">under his spiked steel cap, and he wore mail over boiled leather, dirk and shortsword at his </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">belt. “Was Chataya’s to your satisfaction, my lord?” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="598" height="15" font="1">“Almost too much so,” admitted Tyrion. “You’re certain this woman can be relied on?” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I am certain of nothing in this fickle and treacherous world, my lord. Chataya has no </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="378" height="15" font="1">Allar Deem. Shall we go?” He started down the tunnel. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Even his walk is different</i>, Tyrion observed. The scent of sour wine and garlic clung to </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="563" height="15" font="1">Varys instead of lavender. “I like this new garb of yours,” he offered as they went. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The work I do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights. So </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="550" height="15" font="1">“Leather becomes you. You ought to come like this to our next council session.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="291" height="15" font="1">“Your sister would not approve, my lord.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My sister would soil her smallclothes.” He smiled in the dark. “I saw no signs of any of </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">her spies skulking after me.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I am pleased to hear it, my lord. Some of your sister’s hirelings are mine as well, </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">unbeknownst to her. I should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Well,  <i>I’d</i> hate to think I was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of </text>

<text top="441" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Scarcely for naught,” Varys assured him. “They know you are here. Whether any will </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">be bold enough to enter Chataya’s in the guise of patrons I cannot say, but I find it best to err </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">on the side of caution.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">“How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The tunnel was dug for another King’s Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="180" height="15" font="1">“And yet you knew of it.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="503" height="15" font="1">“Little birds fly through many a dark tunnel. Careful, the steps are steep.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They emerged through a trap at the back of a stable, having come perhaps a distance of </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">three blocks under Rhaenys’s Hill. A horse whickered in his stall when Tyrion let the door </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slam shut. Varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and Tyrion gazed about. A mule </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and three horses occupied the stalls. He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">at his teeth. “Old,” he said, “and I have my doubts about his wind.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He is not a mount to carry you into battle, true,” Varys replied, “but he will serve, and </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">attract no notice. As will the others. And the stableboys see and hear only the animals.” The </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eunuch took a cloak from a peg. It was rough-spun, sun-faded, and threadbare, but very ample </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in its cut. “If you will permit me.” When he swept it over Tyrion’s shoulders it enveloped him </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">head to heel, with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows. “Men see </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">what they expect to see,” Varys said as he fussed and pulled. “Dwarfs are not so common a </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sight as children, so a child is what they will see. A boy in an old cloak on his father’s horse, </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">going about his father’s business. Though it would be best if you came most often by night.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I plan to . . . after today. At the moment, though, Shae awaits me.” He had put her up in </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King’s Landing, not far from the sea, but he had </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">not dared visit her there for fear of being followed. </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="209" height="15" font="1">“Which horse will you have?” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shrugged. “This one will do well enough.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="509" height="15" font="1">“I shall saddle him for you.” Varys took tack and saddle down from a peg. </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly. “You missed a lively council. </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">Stannis has crowned himself, it seems.” </text>

<page number="129" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">

<text top="129" left="171" width="591" height="15" font="1">“He accuses my brother and sister of incest. I wonder how he came by that suspicion.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard’s hair, as Ned Stark did, and </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jon Arryn before him. Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear.” The eunuch’s laugh was </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="1">not his usual giggle, but deeper and more throaty. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="226" height="15" font="1">“Someone like you, perchance?” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="232" height="15" font="1">“Am I suspected? It was not me.” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="254" height="15" font="1">“If it had been, would you admit it?” </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No. But why should I betray a secret I have kept so long? It is one thing to deceive a </text>
<text top="313" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">king, and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney. </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="321" height="15" font="1">Besides, the bastards were there for all to see.” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="250" height="15" font="1">“Robert’s bastards? What of them?” </text>
<text top="383" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing,” Varys said as he wrestled with the </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">saddle. “Their mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all </text>
<text top="422" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">black  as  ravens . . . and  as  ill-omened,  it  would seem. So when Joffrey, Myrcella, and </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Tommen slid out between your sister’s thighs, each as golden as the sun, the truth was not </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">hard to glimpse.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shook his head. <i>If she had borne only one child for her husband, it would have </i></text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>been enough to disarm suspicion . . . but then she would not have been Cersei.</i> “If you were </text>

<text top="550" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="1">“Some traitor, doubtless.” Varys tightened the cinch. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="104" height="15" font="1">“Littlefinger?” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="141" height="15" font="1">“I named no name.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">Tyrion let the eunuch help him mount. “Lord Varys,” he said from the saddle, </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King’s Landing, and sometimes I </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">feel you are my worst enemy.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“How odd. I think quite the same of you.” </text>

<text top="790" left="171" width="606" height="15" font="1">Long before the first pale fingers of light pried apart Bran’s shutters, his eyes were open. </text>
<text top="815" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">There were guests in Winterfell, visitors come for the harvest feast. This morning they </text>
<text top="835" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">would be tilting at quintains in the yard. Once that prospect would have filled him with </text>
<text top="854" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">excitement, but that was <i>before</i>. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Not now. The Walders would break lances with the squires of Lord Manderly’s escort, </text>
<text top="899" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but Bran would have no part of it. He must play the prince in his father’s solar. “Listen, and it </text>
<text top="918" left="139" width="634" height="15" font="1">may be that you will learn something of what lordship is all about,” Maester Luwin had said. </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran had never asked to be a prince. It was knighthood he had always dreamed of; bright </text>
<text top="963" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">armor and streaming banners, lance and sword, a warhorse between his legs. Why must he </text>
<text top="982" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">waste his days listening to old men speak of things he only half understood? <i>Because you’re </i></text>
<text top="1002" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>broken</i>, a voice inside reminded him. A lord on his cushioned chair might be crippled—the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stark in Winterfell,” Ser Rodrik said, reminding him of how Robb used to sit with their lord </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">father when his bannermen came to see him. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Wyman Manderly had arrived from White Harbor two days past, traveling by barge </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and litter, as he was too fat to sit a horse. With him had come a long tail of retainers: knights, </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">squires, lesser lords and ladies, heralds, musicians, even a juggler, all aglitter with banners </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and surcoats in what seemed half a hundred colors. Bran had welcomed them to Winterfell </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from his father’s high stone seat with the direwolves carved into the arms, and afterward Ser </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Rodrik had said he’d done well. If that had been the end of it, he would not have minded. But </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="180" height="15" font="1">it was only the beginning. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The feast makes a pleasant pretext,” Ser Rodrik explained, “but a man does not cross a </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hundred leagues for a sliver of duck and a sip of wine. Only those who have matters of import </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">to set before us are like to make the journey.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran gazed up at the rough stone ceiling above his head. Robb would tell him not to play </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the boy, he knew. He could almost hear him, and their lord father as well. <i>Winter is coming, </i></text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="392" height="15" font="5"><i>and you are almost a man grown, Bran. You have a duty.</i> </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">When Hodor came bustling in, smiling and humming tunelessly, he found the boy </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">resigned to his fate. Together they got him washed and brushed. “The white wool doublet </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">today,” Bran commanded. “And the silver brooch. Ser Rodrik will want me to look lordly.” </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">As much as he could, Bran preferred to dress himself, but there were some tasks—pulling on </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">breeches, lacing his boots—that vexed him. They went quicker with Hodor’s help. Once he </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had been taught to do something, he did it deftly. His hands were always gentle, though his </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">strength was astonishing. “You could have been a knight too, I bet,” Bran told him. “If the </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="454" height="15" font="1">gods hadn’t taken your wits, you would have been a great knight.” </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="621" height="15" font="1">“Hodor?” Hodor blinked at him with guileless brown eyes, eyes innocent of </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">understanding. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” said Bran. “Hodor.” He pointed. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">On the wall beside the door hung a basket, stoutly made of wicker and leather, with holes </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cut for Bran’s legs. Hodor slid his arms through the straps and cinched the wide belt tight </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">around his chest, then knelt beside the bed. Bran used the bars sunk into the wall to support </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">himself as he swung the dead weight of his legs into the basket and through the holes. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” Hodor said again, rising. The stableboy stood near seven feet tall all by himself; </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">on his back Bran’s head almost brushed the ceiling. He ducked low as they passed through the </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">door. One time Hodor smelled bread baking and <i>ran</i> to the kitchens, and Bran got such a </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crack that Maester Luwin had to sew up his scalp. Mikken had given him a rusty old visorless </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">helm from the armory, but Bran seldom troubled to wear it. The Walders laughed whenever </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">they saw it on his head. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He rested his hands on Hodor’s shoulders as they descended the winding stair. Outside, </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the sounds of sword and shield and horse already rang through the yard. It made a sweet </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="447" height="15" font="1">music. <i>I’ll just have a look</i>, Bran thought, <i>a quick look, that’s all.</i> </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The White Harbor lordlings would emerge later in the morning, with their knights and </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">men-at-arms. Until then, the yard belonged to their squires, who ranged in age from ten to </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">forty. Bran wished he were one of them so badly that his stomach hurt with the wanting. </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Two quintains had been erected in the courtyard, each a stout post supporting a spinning </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crossbeam with a shield at one end and a padded butt at the other. The shields had been </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">painted red-and-gold, though the Lannister lions were lumpy and misshapen, and already well </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">scarred by the first boys to take a tilt at them. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The sight of Bran in his basket drew stares from those who had not seen it before, but he </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had learned to ignore stares. At least he had a good view; on Hodor’s back, he towered over </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">everyone. The Walders were mounting up, he saw. They’d brought fine armor up from the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Twins, shining silver plate with enameled blue chasings. Big Walder’s crest was shaped like a </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">castle, while Little Walder favored streamers of blue and grey silk. Their shields and surcoats </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">also set them apart from each other. Little Walder quartered the twin towers of Frey with the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brindled boar of his grandmother’s House and the plowman of his mother’s: Crakehall and </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Darry, respectively. Big Walder’s quarterings were the tree-and-ravens of House Blackwood </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and the twining snakes of the Paeges. <i>They must be hungry for honor</i>, Bran thought as he </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">watched them take up their lances. <i>A Stark needs only the direwolf.</i> </text>
<text top="304" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Their dappled grey coursers were swift, strong, and beautifully trained. Side by side they </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">charged the quintains. Both hit the shields cleanly and were well past before the padded butts </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">came spinning around. Little Walder struck the harder blow, but Bran thought Big Walder sat </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his horse better. He would have given both his useless legs for the chance to ride against </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">either. </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Little Walder cast his splintered lance aside, spied Bran, and reined up. “Now there’s an </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="1">ugly horse,” he said of Hodor. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="214" height="15" font="1">“Hodor’s no horse,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="150" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” said Hodor. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Big Walder trotted up to join his cousin. “Well, he’s not as <i>smart</i> as a horse, that’s for </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="491" height="15" font="1">certain.” A few of the White Harbor lads poked each other and laughed. </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Hodor.” Beaming genially, Hodor looked from one Frey to the other, oblivious to their </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">taunting. “Hodor hodor?” </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Little Walder’s mount whickered. “See, they’re talking to each other. Maybe <i>hodor</i> </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="202" height="15" font="1">means ‘I love you’ in horse.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">“You shut up, Frey.” Bran could feel his color rising. </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Little Walder spurred his horse closer, giving Hodor a bump that pushed him backward. </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="1">“What will you do if I don’t?” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="385" height="15" font="1">“He’ll set his wolf on you, cousin,” warned Big Walder. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">“Let him. I always wanted a wolfskin cloak.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="348" height="15" font="1">“Summer would tear your fat head off,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Little Walder banged a mailed fist against his breastplate. “Does your wolf have steel </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">teeth, to bite through plate and mail?” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Enough!</i>” Maester Luwin’s voice cracked through the clangor of the yard as loud as a </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thunderclap. How much he had overheard, Bran could not say . . . but it was enough to anger </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him, clearly. “These threats are unseemly, and I’ll hear no more of them. Is this how you </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="249" height="15" font="1">behave at the Twins, Walder Frey?” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“If I want to.” Atop his courser, Little Walder gave Luwin a sullen glare, as if to say, <i>You </i></text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="5"><i>are only a maester, who are you to reproach a Frey of the Crossing?</i> </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, it is not how Lady Stark’s wards ought behave at Winterfell. What’s at the root of </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="590" height="15" font="1">this?” The maester looked at each boy in turn. “One of you will tell me, I swear, or—” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We were having a jape with Hodor,” confessed Big Walder. “I am sorry if we offended </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="593" height="15" font="1">Prince Bran. We only meant to be amusing.” He at least had the grace to look abashed. </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="597" height="15" font="1">Little Walder only looked peevish. “And me,” he said. “I was only being amusing too.” </text>

<page number="132" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The bald spot atop the maester’s head had turned red, Bran could see; if anything, Luwin </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was more angry than before. “A good lord comforts and protects the weak and helpless,” he </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">told the Freys. “I will not have you making Hodor the butt of cruel jests, do you hear me? </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He’s a goodhearted lad, dutiful and obedient, which is more than I can say for either of you.” </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The maester wagged a finger at Little Walder. “And you will stay <i>out</i> of the godswood and </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">away from those wolves, or answer for it.” Sleeves flapping, he turned on his heels, stalked </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">off a few paces, and glanced back. “Bran. Come. Lord Wyman awaits.” </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“Hodor, go with the maester,” Bran commanded. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” said Hodor. His long strides caught up with the maester’s furiously pumping </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">legs on the steps of the Great Keep. Maester Luwin held the door open, and Bran hugged </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">Hodor’s neck and ducked as they went through. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="192" height="15" font="1">“The Walders—” he began. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ll hear no more of that, it’s done.” Maester Luwin looked worn-out and frayed. “You </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">were right to defend Hodor, but you should never have been there. Ser Rodrik and Lord </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Wyman have broken their fast already while they waited for you. Must I come myself to fetch </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">you, as if you were a little child?” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“No,” Bran said, ashamed. “I’m sorry. I only wanted . . .” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I know what you wanted,” Maester Luwin said, more gently. “Would that it could be, </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">Bran. Do you have any questions before we begin this audience?” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="183" height="15" font="1">“Will we talk of the war?” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>You</i> will talk of naught.” The sharpness was back in Luwin’s voice. “You are still a </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">child of eight . . .” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“Almost nine!” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Eight,” the maester repeated firmly. “Speak nothing but courtesies unless Ser Rodrik or </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">Lord Wyman puts you a question.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="213" height="15" font="1">Bran nodded. “I’ll remember.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="558" height="15" font="1">“I will say nothing to Ser Rodrik of what passed between you and the Frey boys.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="96" height="15" font="1">“Thank you.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They put Bran in his father’s oak chair with the grey velvet cushions, behind a long </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">plank-and-trestle table. Ser Rodrik sat on his right hand and Maester Luwin to his left, armed </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with quills and inkpots and a sheaf of blank parchment to write down all that transpired. Bran </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ran a hand across the rough wood of the table and begged Lord Wyman’s pardons for being </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="33" height="15" font="1">late. </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why, no prince is ever late,” the Lord of White Harbor responded amiably. “Those who </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">arrive before him have come early, that’s all.” Wyman Manderly had a great booming laugh. </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">It was small wonder he could not sit a saddle; he looked as if he outweighed most horses. As </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">windy as he was vast, he began by asking Winterfell to confirm the new customs officers he </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">had appointed for White Harbor. The old ones had been holding back silver for King’s </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Landing rather than paying it over to the new King in the North. “King Robb needs his own </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">coinage as well,” he declared, “and White Harbor is the very place to mint it.” He offered to </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">take charge of the matter, as it please the king, and went from that to speak of how he had </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">strengthened the port’s defenses, detailing the cost of every improvement. </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In addition to a mint, Lord Manderly also proposed to build Robb a warfleet. “We have </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had no strength at sea for hundreds of years, since Brandon the Burner put the torch to his </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">father’s ships. Grant me the gold and within the year I will float you sufficient galleys to take </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">Dragonstone and King’s Landing both.” </text>
</page>
<page number="133" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran’s interest pricked up at talk of warships. No one asked him, but he thought Lord </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Wyman’s notion a splendid one. In his mind’s eye he could see them already. He wondered if </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a cripple had ever commanded a warship. But Ser Rodrik promised only to send the proposal </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">on to Robb for his consideration, while Maester Luwin scratched at the parchment. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Midday came and went. Maester Luwin sent Poxy Tym down to the kitchens, and they </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dined in the solar on cheese, capons, and brown oatbread. While tearing apart a bird with fat </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fingers, Lord Wyman made polite inquiry after Lady Hornwood, who was a cousin of his. </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“She was born a Manderly, you know. Perhaps, when her grief has run its course, she would </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">like to be a Manderly again, eh?” He took a bite from a wing, and smiled broadly. “As it </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">happens, I am a widower these past eight years. Past time I took another wife, don’t you </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">agree, my lords? A man does get lonely.” Tossing the bones aside, he reached for a leg. “Or if </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the lady fancies a younger lad, well, my son Wendel is unwed as well. He is off south </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">guarding Lady Catelyn, but no doubt he will wish to take a bride on his return. A valiant boy, </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and jolly, just the man to teach her to laugh again, eh?” He wiped a bit of grease off his chin </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">with the sleeve of his tunic. </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran could hear the distant clash of arms through the windows. He cared nothing about </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">marriages. <i>I wish I was down in the yard.</i> </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His lordship waited until the table had been cleared before he raised the matter of a letter </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he had received from Lord Tywin Lannister, who held his elder son, Ser Wylis, taken captive </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">on the Green Fork. “He offers him back to me without ransom, provided I withdraw my levies </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">from His Grace and vow to fight no more.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="344" height="15" font="1">“You will refuse him, of course,” said Ser Rodrik. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Have no fear on that count,” the lord assured them. “King Robb has no more loyal </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">servant than Wyman Manderly. I would be loath to see my son languish at Harrenhal any </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">longer than he must, however. That is an ill place. Cursed, they say. Not that I am the sort to </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swallow such tales, but still, there it is. Look at what’s befallen this Janos Slynt. Raised up to </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lord of Harrenhal by the queen, and cast down by her brother. Shipped off to the Wall, they </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">say. I pray some equitable exchange of captives can be arranged before too very long. I know </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Wylis would not want to sit out the rest of the war. Gallant, that son of mine, and fierce as a </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">mastiff.” </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran’s shoulders were stiff from sitting in the same chair by the time the audience drew </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to a close. And that night, as he sat to supper, a horn sounded to herald the arrival of another </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">guest. Lady Donella Hornwood brought no tail of knights and retainers; only herself, and six </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tired men-at-arms with a moosehead badge on their dusty orange livery. “We are very sorry </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for all you have suffered, my lady,” Bran said when she came before him to speak her words </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of greetings. Lord Hornwood had been killed in the battle on the Green Fork, their only son </text>

<text top="864" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That is good to know.” She was a pale husk of a woman, every line of her face etched </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">with grief. “I am very weary, my lord. If I might have leave to rest, I should be thankful.” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="533" height="15" font="1">“To be sure,” Ser Rodrik said. “There is time enough for talk on the morrow.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the morrow came, most of the morning was given over to talk of grains and greens </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and salting meat. Once the maesters in their Citadel had proclaimed the first of autumn, wise </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">men put away a portion of each harvest . . . though how large a portion was a matter that </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seemed to require much talk. Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest. At Maester </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">Luwin’s suggestion, she vowed to increase that to a quarter. </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Bolton’s bastard is massing men at the Dreadfort,” she warned them. “I hope he means </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to take them south to join his father at the Twins, but when I sent to ask his intent, he told me </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that no Bolton would be questioned by a woman. As if he were trueborn and had a right to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="82" height="15" font="1">that name.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Lord Bolton has never acknowledged the boy, so far as I know,” Ser Rodrik said. “I </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="1">confess, I do not know him.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Few do,” she replied. “He lived with his mother until two years past, when young </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Domeric died and left Bolton without an heir. That was when he brought his bastard to the </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dreadfort. The boy is a sly creature by all accounts, and he has a servant who is almost as </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cruel as he is. Reek, they call the man. It’s said he never bathes. They hunt together, the </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bastard and this Reek, and not for deer. I’ve heard tales, things I can scarce believe, even of a </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bolton. And now that my lord husband and my sweet son have gone to the gods, the Bastard </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">looks at my lands hungrily.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran wanted to give the lady a hundred men to defend her rights, but Ser Rodrik only </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">said, “He may look, but should he do more I promise you there will be dire retribution. You </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will be safe enough, my lady . . . though perhaps in time, when your grief is passed, you may </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="204" height="15" font="1">find it prudent to wed again.” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I am past my childbearing years, what beauty I had long fled,” she replied with a tired </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">half smile, “yet men come sniffing after me as they never did when I was a maid.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="412" height="15" font="1">“You do not look favorably on these suitors?” asked Luwin. </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I shall wed again if His Grace commands it,” Lady Hornwood replied, “but Mors </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Crowfood is a drunken brute, and older than my father. As for my noble cousin of Manderly, </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">my lord’s bed is not large enough to hold one of his majesty, and I am surely too small and </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="170" height="15" font="1">frail to lie beneath him.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran knew that men slept on top of women when they shared a bed. Sleeping under Lord </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Manderly would be like sleeping under a fallen horse, he imagined. Ser Rodrik gave the </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">widow a sympathetic nod. “You will have other suitors, my lady. We shall try and find you a </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="1">prospect more to your taste.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps you need not look very far, ser.” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After she had taken her leave, Maester Luwin smiled. “Ser Rodrik, I do believe my lady </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">fancies you.” </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="385" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="214" height="15" font="1">“She was very sad,” said Bran. </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik nodded. “Sad and gentle, and not at all uncomely for a woman of her years, </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="569" height="15" font="1">for all her modesty. Yet a danger to the peace of your brother’s realm nonetheless.” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="205" height="15" font="1">“Her?” Bran said, astonished. </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin answered. “With no direct heir, there are sure to be many claimants </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">contending for the Hornwood lands. The Tallharts, Flints, and Karstarks all have ties to House </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Hornwood through the female line, and the Glovers are fostering Lord Harys’s bastard at </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Deepwood Motte. The Dreadfort has no claim that I know, but the lands adjoin, and Roose </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="312" height="15" font="1">Bolton is not one to overlook such a chance.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers. “In such cases, her liege lord must find her a suitable </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">match.” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Why  <i>can’t</i> you marry her?” Bran asked. “You said she was comely, and Beth would </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">have a mother.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The old knight put a hand on Bran’s arm. “A kindly thought, my prince, but I am only a </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knight, and besides too old. I might hold her lands for a few years, but as soon as I died Lady </text>
</page>
<page number="135" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Hornwood would find herself back in the same mire, and Beth’s prospects might be perilous </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">as well.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then let Lord Hornwood’s bastard be the heir,” Bran said, thinking of his half-brother </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="32" height="15" font="1">Jon. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik said, “That would please the Glovers, and perhaps Lord Hornwood’s shade as </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">well, but I do not think Lady Hornwood would love us. The boy is not of her blood.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Still,” said Maester Luwin, “it must be considered. Lady Donella is past her fertile </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="348" height="15" font="1">years, as she said herself. If not the bastard, who?” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“May I be excused?” Bran could hear the squires at their swordplay in the yard below, </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">the ring of steel on steel. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As you will, my prince,” said Ser Rodrik. “You did well.” Bran flushed with pleasure. </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Being a lord was not so tedious as he had feared, and since Lady Hornwood had been so much </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">briefer than Lord Manderly, he even had a few hours of daylight left to visit with Summer. He </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">liked to spend time with his wolf every day, when Ser Rodrik and the maester allowed it. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No sooner had Hodor entered the godswood than Summer emerged from under an oak, </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">almost as if he had known they were coming. Bran glimpsed a lean black shape watching </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from the undergrowth as well. “Shaggy,” he called. “Here, Shaggydog. To me.” But Rickon’s </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">wolf vanished as swiftly as he’d appeared. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hodor knew Bran’s favorite place, so he took him to the edge of the pool beneath the </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">great spread of the heart tree, where Lord Eddard used to kneel to pray. Ripples were running </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">across the surface of the water when they arrived, making the reflection of the weirwood </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">shimmer and dance. There was no wind, though. For an instant Bran was baffled. </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">And then Osha exploded up out of the pool with a great splash, so sudden that even </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Summer leapt back, snarling. Hodor jumped away, wailing “Hodor, <i>Hodor</i>,” in dismay until </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Bran patted his shoulder to soothe his fears. “How can you swim in there?” he asked Osha. </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">“Isn’t it cold?” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As a babe I suckled on icicles, boy. I like the cold.” Osha swam to the rocks and rose </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dripping. She was naked, her skin bumpy with gooseprickles. Summer crept close and sniffed </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="265" height="15" font="1">at her. “I wanted to touch the bottom.” </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“I never knew there was a bottom.” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Might be there isn’t.” She grinned. “What are you staring at, boy? Never seen a woman </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">before?” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I have so.” Bran had bathed with his sisters hundreds of times and he’d seen serving </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">women in the hot pools too. Osha looked different, though, hard and sharp instead of soft and </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">curvy. Her legs were all sinew, her breasts flat as two empty purses. “You’ve got a lot of </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">scars.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Every one hard-earned.” She picked up her brown shift, shook some leaves off of it, and </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">pulled it down over her head. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Fighting giants?” Osha claimed there were still giants beyond the Wall. <i>One day maybe </i></text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="5"><i>I’ll even see one . . .</i> </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Fighting men.” She belted herself with a length of rope. “Black crows, oft as not. Killed </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">me one too,” she said, shaking out her hair. It had grown since she’d come to Winterfell, well </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down past her ears. She looked softer than the woman who had once tried to rob and kill him </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">in the wolfswood. “Heard some yattering in the kitchen today about you and them Freys.” </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="194" height="15" font="1">“Who? What did they say?” </text>
</page>
<page number="136" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She gave him a sour grin. “That it’s a fool boy who mocks a giant, and a mad world </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">when a cripple has to defend him.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Hodor never knew they were mocking him,” Bran said. “Anyhow he never fights.” He </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">remembered once when he was little, going to the market square with his mother and Septa </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mordane. They brought Hodor to carry for them, but he had wandered away, and when they </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">found him some boys had him backed into an alley, poking him with sticks. “<i>Hodor!</i>” he kept </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">shouting, cringing and covering himself, but he had never raised a hand against his </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="382" height="15" font="1">tormentors. “Septon Chayle says he has a gentle spirit.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” she said, “and hands strong enough to twist a man’s head off his shoulders, if he </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">takes a mind to. All the same, he better watch his back around that Walder. Him and you both. </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The big one they call little, it comes to me he’s well named. Big outside, little inside, and </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="181" height="15" font="1">mean down to the bones.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="521" height="15" font="1">“He’d never dare hurt me. He’s scared of Summer, no matter what he says.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Then might be he’s not so stupid as he seems.” Osha was always wary around the </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">direwolves. The day she was taken, Summer and Grey Wind between them had torn three </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wildlings to bloody pieces. “Or might be he is. And that tastes of trouble too.” She tied up her </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="311" height="15" font="1">hair. “You have more of them wolf dreams?” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="321" height="15" font="1">“No.” He did not like to talk about the dreams. </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“A prince should lie better than that.” Osha laughed. “Well, your dreams are your </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">business. Mine’s in the kitchens, and I’d best be getting back before Gage starts to shouting </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">and waving that big wooden spoon of his. By your leave, my prince.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>She should never have talked about the wolf dreams</i>, Bran thought as Hodor carried him </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up the steps to his bedchamber. He fought against sleep as long as he could, but in the end it </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">took him as it always did. On this night he dreamed of the weirwood. It was looking at him </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">with its deep red eyes, calling to him with its twisted wooden mouth, and from its pale </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">branches the three-eyed crow came flapping, pecking at his face and crying his name in a </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">voice as sharp as swords. </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The blast of horns woke him. Bran pushed himself onto his side, grateful for the reprieve. </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He heard horses and boisterous shouting. <i>More guests have come, and half-drunk by the noise </i></text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>of them.</i> Grasping his bars he pulled himself from the bed and over to the window seat. On </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their banner was a giant in shattered chains that told him that these were Umber men, down </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">from the northlands beyond the Last River. </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The next day two of them came together to audience; the Greatjon’s uncles, blustery men </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the winter of their days with beards as white as the bearskin cloaks they wore. A crow had </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">once taken Mors for dead and pecked out his eye, so he wore a chunk of dragonglass in its </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stead. As Old Nan told the tale, he’d grabbed the crow in his fist and bitten its head off, so </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">they named him Crowfood. She would never tell Bran why his gaunt brother Hother was </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="138" height="15" font="1">called Whoresbane. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">No sooner had they been seated than Mors asked for leave to wed Lady Hornwood. “The </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Greatjon’s the Young Wolf’s strong right hand, all know that to be true. Who better to protect </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="470" height="15" font="1">the widow’s lands than an Umber, and what Umber better than me?” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">“Lady Donella is still grieving,” Maester Luwin said. </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“I have a cure for grief under my furs.” Mors laughed. Ser Rodrik thanked him </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="507" height="15" font="1">courteously and promised to bring the matter before the lady and the king. </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hother wanted ships. “There’s wildlings stealing down from the north, more than I’ve </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ever seen before. They cross the Bay of Seals in little boats and wash up on our shores. The </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik pulled at his whiskers. “You have forests of tall pine and old oak. Lord </text>

<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mock him as Lord Lamprey, I’ve heard. The man can scarce walk. If you stuck a sword in his </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">belly, ten thousand eels would wriggle out.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He is fat,” Ser Rodrik admitted, “but he is not stupid. You will work with him, or the </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">king will know the reason why.” And to Bran’s astonishment, the truculent Umbers agreed to </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="363" height="15" font="1">do as he commanded, though not without grumbling. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">While they were sitting at audience, the Glover men arrived from Deepwood Motte, and </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">a large party of Tallharts from Torrhen’s Square. Galbart and Robett Glover had left </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Deepwood in the hands of Robett’s wife, but it was their steward who came to Winterfell. </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“My lady begs that you excuse her absence. Her babes are still too young for such a journey, </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and she was loath to leave them.” Bran soon realized that it was the steward, not Lady Glover, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">who truly ruled at Deepwood Motte. The man allowed that he was at present setting aside </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">only a tenth of his harvest. A hedge wizard had told him there would be a bountiful spirit </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">summer before the cold set in, he claimed. Maester Luwin had a number of choice things to </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">say about hedge wizards. Ser Rodrik commanded the man to set aside a fifth, and questioned </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the steward closely about Lord Hornwood’s bastard, the boy Larence Snow. In the north, all </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">highborn bastards took the surname <i>Snow</i>. This lad was near twelve, and the steward praised </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">his wits and courage. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your notion about the bastard may have merit, Bran,” Maester Luwin said after. “One </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="353" height="15" font="1">day you will be a good lord for Winterfell, I think.” </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No I won’t.” Bran knew he would never be a lord, no more than he could be a knight. </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“Robb’s to marry some Frey girl, you told me so yourself, and the Walders say the same. </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="499" height="15" font="1">He’ll have sons, and they’ll be the lords of Winterfell after him, not me.” </text>
<text top="708" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It may be so, Bran,” Ser Rodrik said, “but I was wed three times and my wives gave me </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">daughters. Now only Beth remains to me. My brother Martyn fathered four strong sons, yet </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">only Jory lived to be a man. When he was slain, Martyn’s line died with him. When we speak </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">of the morrow nothing is ever certain.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Leobald Tallhart had his turn the following day. He spoke of weather portents and the </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slack wits of smallfolk, and told how his nephew itched for battle. “Benfred has raised his </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">own company of lances. Boys, none older than nineteen years, but every one thinks he’s </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">another young wolf. When I told them they were only young rabbits, they laughed at me. Now </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they call themselves the Wild Hares and gallop about the country with rabbitskins tied to the </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">ends of their lances, singing songs of chivalry.” </text>
<text top="914" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran thought that sounded grand. He remembered Benfred Tallhart, a big bluff loud boy </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">who had often visited Winterfell with his father, Ser Helman, and had been friendly with </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Robb and with Theon Greyjoy. But Ser Rodrik was clearly displeased by what he heard. “If </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the king were in need of more men, he would send for them,” he said. “Instruct your nephew </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">that he is to remain at Torrhen’s Square, as his lord father commanded.” </text>
<text top="1017" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I will, ser,” said Leobald, and only then raised the matter of Lady Hornwood. Poor </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">thing, with no husband to defend her lands nor son to inherit. His own lady wife was a </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Hornwood, sister to the late Lord Halys, doubtless they recalled. “An empty hall is a sad one. </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">I had a thought to send my younger son to Lady Donella to foster as her own. Beren is near </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ten, a likely lad, and her own nephew. He would cheer her, I am certain, and perhaps he </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">would even take the name Hornwood . . .” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">“If he were named heir?” suggested Maester Luwin. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">“. . . so the House might continue,” finished Leobald. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran knew what to say. “Thank you for the notion, my lord,” he blurted out before Ser </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">Rodrik could speak. “We will bring the matter to my brother Robb. Oh, and Lady </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">Hornwood.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Leobald seemed surprised that he had spoken. “I’m grateful, my prince,” he said, but </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Bran saw pity in his pale blue eyes, mingled perhaps with a little gladness that the cripple </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">was, after all, not <i>his</i> son. For a moment he hated the man. </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin liked him better, though. “Beren Tallhart may well be our best answer,” </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he told them when Leobald had gone. “By blood he is half Hornwood. If he takes his uncle’s </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">name . . .” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“. . . he will still be a boy,” said Ser Rodrik, “and hard-pressed to hold his lands against </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the likes of Mors Umber or this bastard of Roose Bolton’s. We must think on this carefully. </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">Robb should have our best counsel before he makes his decision.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It may come down to practicalities,” said Maester Luwin. “Which lord he most needs to </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">court. The riverlands are part of his realm, he may wish to cement the alliance by wedding </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="598" height="15" font="1">Lady Hornwood to one of the lords of the Trident. A Blackwood, perhaps, or a Frey—” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lady Hornwood can have one of our Freys,” said Bran. “She can have both of them if </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="75" height="15" font="1">she likes.” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="393" height="15" font="1">“You are not kind, my prince,” Ser Rodrik chided gently. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="567" height="15" font="5"><i>Neither are the Walders.</i> Scowling, Bran stared down at the table and said nothing. </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In the days that followed, ravens arrived from other lordly houses, bearing regrets. The </text>

<text top="711" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Stark had been heard from save for Howland Reed the crannogman, who had not set foot </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">outside his swamps for many a year, and the Cerwyns whose castle lay a half day’s ride from </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Winterfell. Lord Cerwyn was a captive of the Lannisters, but his son, a lad of fourteen, </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">arrived one bright, blustery morning at the head of two-dozen lances. Bran was riding Dancer </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">around the yard when they came through the gate. He trotted over to greet them. Cley Cerwyn </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="344" height="15" font="1">had always been a friend to Bran and his brothers. </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Good morrow, Bran,” Cley called out cheerfully. “Or must I call you Prince Bran now?” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="139" height="15" font="1">“Only if you want.” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cley laughed. “Why not? Everyone else is a king or prince these days. Did Stannis write </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">Winterfell as well?” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="173" height="15" font="1">“Stannis? I don’t know.” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He’s a king now too,” Cley confided. “He says Queen Cersei bedded her brother, so </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">Joffrey is a bastard.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Joffrey the Illborn,” one of the Cerwyn knights growled. “Small wonder he’s faithless, </text>

<text top="1043" left="171" width="620" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” said another, “the gods hate incest. Look how they brought down the </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">For a moment Bran felt as though he could not breathe. A giant hand was crushing his </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">chest. He felt as though he was falling, and clutched desperately at Dancer’s reins. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His terror must have shown on his face. “Bran?” Cley Cerwyn said. “Are you unwell? </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">It’s only another king.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Robb will beat him too.” He turned Dancer’s head toward the stables, oblivious to the </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">puzzled stares the Cerwyns gave him. His blood was roaring in his ears, and had he not been </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="348" height="15" font="1">strapped onto his saddle he might well have fallen. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">That night Bran prayed to his father’s gods for dreamless sleep. If the gods heard, they </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">mocked his hopes, for the nightmare they sent was worse than any wolf dream. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Fly or die!</i>” cried the three-eyed crow as it pecked at him. He wept and pleaded but the </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">crow had no pity. It put out his left eye and then his right, and when he was blind in the dark it </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pecked at his brow, driving its terrible sharp beak deep into his skull. He screamed until he </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was certain his lungs must burst. The pain was an axe splitting his head apart, but when the </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crow wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain, Bran could see again. What </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he saw made him gasp in fear. He was clinging to a tower miles high, and his fingers were </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slipping, nails scrabbling at the stone, his legs dragging him down, stupid useless dead legs. </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“<i>Help me!</i>” he cried. A golden man appeared in the sky above him and pulled him up. “The </text>

<text top="558" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I do not sleep as I did when I was younger,” Grand Maester Pycelle told him, by way of </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">apology for the dawn meeting. “I would sooner be up, though the world be dark, than lie </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">restless abed, fretting on tasks undone,” he said—though his heavy-lidded eyes made him </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">look half-asleep as he said it. </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the airy chambers beneath the rookery, his girl served them boiled eggs, stewed plums, </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and porridge, while Pycelle served the pontifications. “In these sad times, when so many </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">hunger, I think it only fitting to keep my table spare.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Commendable,” Tyrion admitted, breaking a large brown egg that reminded him unduly </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the Grand Maester’s bald spotted head. “I take a different view. If there is food I eat it, in </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">case there is none on the morrow.” He smiled. “Tell me, are your ravens early risers as well?” </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Pycelle stroked the snowy beard that flowed down his chest. “To be sure. Shall I send for </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">quill and ink after we have eaten?” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“No need.” Tyrion laid the letters on the table beside his porridge, twin parchments </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="590" height="15" font="1">tightly rolled and sealed with wax at both ends. “Send your girl away, so we can talk.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Leave us, child,” Pycelle commanded. The serving girl hurried from the room. “These </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="116" height="15" font="1">letters, now . . .” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“For the eyes of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne.” Tyrion peeled the cracked shell away </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">from his egg and took a bite. It wanted salt. “One letter, in two copies. Send your swiftest </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="254" height="15" font="1">birds. The matter is of great import.” </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="404" height="15" font="1">“I shall dispatch them as soon as we have broken our fast.” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Dispatch them now. Stewed plums will keep. The realm may not. Lord Renly is leading </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">his host up the roseroad, and no one can say when Lord Stannis will sail from Dragonstone.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">Pycelle blinked. “If my lord prefers—” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I am here to serve.” The maester pushed himself ponderously to his feet, his chain of </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">office clinking softly. It was a heavy thing, a dozen maester’s collars threaded around and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">through each other and ornamented with gemstones. And it seemed to Tyrion that the gold </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="468" height="15" font="1">and silver and platinum links far outnumbered those of baser metals. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Pycelle moved so slowly that Tyrion had time to finish his egg and taste the plums—</text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">overcooked and watery, to his taste—before the sound of wings prompted him to rise. He </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">spied the raven, dark in the dawn sky, and turned briskly toward the maze of shelves at the far </text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The maester’s medicines made an impressive display; dozens of pots sealed with wax, </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hundreds of stoppered vials, as many milkglass bottles, countless jars of dried herbs, each </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">container neatly labeled in Pycelle’s precise hand. <i>An orderly mind</i>, Tyrion reflected, and </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">indeed, once you puzzled out the arrangement, it was easy to see that every potion had its </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">place.  <i>And such interesting things.</i> He noted sweetsleep and nightshade, milk of the poppy, </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the tears of Lys, powdered greycap, wolfsbane and demon’s dance, basilisk venom, blindeye, </text>

<text top="413" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Standing on his toes and straining upward, he managed to pull a small dusty bottle off the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">high shelf. When he read the label, he smiled and slipped it up his sleeve. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He was back at the table peeling another egg when Grand Maester Pycelle came creeping </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">down the stairs. “It is done, my lord.” The old man seated himself. “A matter like this . . . best </text>

<text top="522" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh, yes.” The porridge was too thick, Tyrion felt, and wanted butter and honey. To be </text>

<text top="720" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion tapped his wooden spoon against the edge of the bowl. “The council exists to </text>

<text top="764" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“Just so,” said Pycelle, “and the king—” </text>

<text top="923" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Pycelle dropped his gaze back to his food. Something about Tyrion’s mismatched green-</text>

<text top="1007" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“That’s just the sort of fellow I am.” Tyrion returned to the unsatisfactory porridge. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And a woman, to be sure,” Grand Maester Pycelle said. “A most uncommon woman, </text>

<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">And I thank you for the hospitality of your table. But a long day awaits.” He swung his legs </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">out and clambered down from his chair. “Be so good as to inform me at once should we </text>

<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He waddled out into the lower bailey; his stunted legs complained of the steps. The sun </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was well up now, and the castle was stirring. Guardsmen walked the walls, and knights and </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">men-at-arms were training with blunted weapons. Nearby, Bronn sat on the lip of a well. A </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pair of comely serving girls sauntered past carrying a wicker basket of rushes between them, </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but the sellsword never looked. “Bronn, I despair of you.” Tyrion gestured at the wenches. </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="610" height="15" font="1">“With sweet sights like that before you, all you see is a gaggle of louts raising a clangor.” </text>

<text top="553" left="171" width="377" height="15" font="1">“Some hedge knight. Tallad, he names himself. Why?” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Bronn pushed a fall of hair from his eyes. “He’s the best of them. But watch him, he falls </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">into a rhythm, delivering the same strokes in the same order each time he attacks.” He </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="422" height="15" font="1">grinned. “That will be the death of him, the day he faces me.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He’s pledged to Joffrey; he’s not like to face you.” They set off across the bailey, Bronn </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">matching his long stride to Tyrion’s short one. These days the sellsword was looking almost </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">respectable. His dark hair was washed and brushed, he was freshly shaved, and he wore the </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">black breastplate of an officer of the City Watch. From his shoulders trailed a cloak of </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lannister crimson patterned with golden hands. Tyrion had made him a gift of it when he </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">named him captain of his personal guard. “How many supplicants do we have today?” he </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">inquired. </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Thirty-odd,” answered Bronn. “Most with complaints, or wanting something, as ever. </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">Your pet was back.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="195" height="15" font="1">He groaned. “Lady Tanda?” </text>

<text top="898" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“—her daughter,” Tyrion finished sourly. Since the hour he had arrived in the Red Keep, </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lady Tanda had been stalking him, armed with a never-ending arsenal of lamprey pies, wild </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">boars, and savory cream stews. Somehow she had gotten the notion that a dwarf lordling </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would be the perfect consort for her daughter Lollys, a large, soft, dim-witted girl who rumor </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">said was still a maid at thirty-and-three. “Send her my regrets.” </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="351" height="15" font="1">“No taste for stuffed goose?” Bronn grinned evilly. </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="577" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps you should eat the goose and marry the maid. Or better still, send Shagga.” </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Shagga’s more like to eat the maid and marry the goose,” observed Bronn. “Anyway, </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">Lollys outweighs him.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There is that,” Tyrion admitted as they passed under the shadow of a covered walkway </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">between two towers. “Who else wants me?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The sellsword grew more serious. “There’s a moneylender from Braavos, holding fancy </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="1">papers and the like, requests to see the king about payment on some loan.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As if Joff could count past twenty. Send the man to Littlefinger, he’ll find a way to put </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A lordling down from the Trident, says your father’s men burned his keep, raped his </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">wife, and killed all his peasants.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I believe they call that <i>war</i>.” Tyrion smelled Gregor Clegane’s work, or that of Ser </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Amory Lorch or his father’s other pet hellhound, the Qohorik. “What does he want of </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">Joffrey?” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“New peasants,” Bronn said. “He walked all this way to sing how loyal he is and beg for </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="97" height="15" font="1">recompense.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I’ll make time for him on the morrow.” Whether truly loyal or merely desperate, a </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">compliant river lord might have his uses. “See that he’s given a comfortable chamber and a </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hot meal. Send him a new pair of boots as well, good ones, courtesy of King Joffrey.” A show </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">of generosity never hurt. </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bronn gave a curt nod. “There’s also a great gaggle of bakers, butchers, and greengrocers </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">clamoring to be heard.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I told them last time, I have nothing to give them.” Only a thin trickle of food was </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">coming into King’s Landing, most of it earmarked for castle and garrison. Prices had risen </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">sickeningly high on greens, roots, flour, and fruit, and Tyrion did not want to think about what </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sorts of flesh might be going into the kettles of the pot-shops down in Flea Bottom. Fish, he </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">hoped. They still had the river and the sea . . . at least until Lord Stannis sailed. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They want protection. Last night a baker was roasted in his own oven. The mob claimed </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">he charged too much for bread.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="72" height="15" font="1">“Did he?” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="175" height="15" font="1">“He’s not apt to deny it.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="224" height="15" font="1">“They didn’t eat him, did they?” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="152" height="15" font="1">“Not that I’ve heard.” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Next time they will,” Tyrion said grimly. “I give them what protection I can. The gold </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">cloaks—” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They claim there were gold cloaks in the mob,” Bronn said. “They’re demanding to </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">speak to the king himself.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Fools.” Tyrion had sent them off with regrets; his nephew would send them off with </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whips and spears. He was half-tempted to allow it . . . but no, he dare not. Soon or late, some </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">enemy would march on King’s Landing, and the last thing he wanted was willing traitors </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">within the city walls. “Tell them King Joffrey shares their fears and will do all he can for </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">them.” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“They want bread, not promises.” </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If I give them bread today, on the morrow I’ll have twice as many at the gates. Who </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">else?” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A black brother down from the Wall. The steward says he brought some rotted hand in a </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">“No. Some knight. Thorne.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Ser <i>Alliser</i> Thorne?” Of all the black brothers he’d met on the Wall, Tyrion Lannister </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had liked Ser Alliser Thorne the least. A bitter, mean-spirited man with too great a sense of </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his own worth. “Come to think on it, I don’t believe I care to see Ser Alliser just now. Find </text>

<text top="341" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Mounted on her white palfrey, Cersei towered high above him, a goddess in green. </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Brother,” she called out, not warmly. The queen had not been pleased by the way he’d dealt </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace.” Tyrion bowed politely. “You look lovely this morning.” Her crown was </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">gold, her cloak ermine. Her retinue sat their mounts behind her: Ser Boros Blount of the </text>

<text top="502" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lancel Lannister, her late husband’s squire up-jumped to knight at his widow’s insistence. </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Vylarr and twenty guardsmen rode escort. “Where are you bound this day, sister?” Tyrion </text>

<text top="566" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m making a round of the gates to inspect the new scorpions and spitfires. I would not </text>

<text top="605" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">fixed him with those clear green eyes of hers, beautiful even in their contempt. “I am </text>

<text top="720" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Not at his present leisurely pace,” Tyrion assured her. “He feasts every night in a </text>

<text top="764" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And every day, more men rally to his banners. His host is now said to be a hundred </text>

<text top="809" left="171" width="178" height="15" font="1">“That seems rather high.” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He has the power of Storm’s End and Highgarden behind him, you little fool,” Cersei </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">snapped down at him. “All the Tyrell bannermen but for the Redwynes, and you have me to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She ignored the question. “And when do you plan to free Jaime? He’s worth a hundred of </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">you.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion grinned crookedly. “Don’t tell Lady Stark, I beg you. We don’t have a hundred of </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="92" height="15" font="1">me to trade.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Father must have been mad to send you. You’re worse than useless.” The queen jerked </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on her reins and wheeled her palfrey around. She rode out the gate at a brisk trot, ermine </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">cloak streaming behind her. Her retinue hastened after. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In truth, Renly Baratheon did not frighten Tyrion half so much as his brother Stannis did. </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Renly was beloved of the commons, but he had never before led men in war. Stannis was </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">otherwise: hard, cold, inexorable. If only they had some way of knowing what was happening </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on Dragonstone . . . but not one of the fisherfolk he had paid to spy out the island had ever </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">returned, and even the informers the eunuch claimed to have placed in Stannis’s household </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had been ominously silent. The striped hulls of Lysene war galleys had been seen offshore, </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though, and Varys had reports from Myr of sellsail captains taking service with Dragonstone. </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>If Stannis attacks by sea while his brother Renly storms the gates, they’ll soon be mounting </i></text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Joffrey’s head on a spike. Worse, mine will be beside him.</i> A depressing thought. He ought to </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="510" height="15" font="1">make plans to get Shae safely out of the city, should the worst seem likely. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Podrick Payne stood at the door of his solar, studying the floor. “He’s inside,” he </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">announced to Tyrion’s belt buckle. “Your solar. My lord. Sorry.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Tyrion sighed. “<i>Look</i> at me, Pod. It unnerves me when you talk to my codpiece, </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="435" height="15" font="1">especially when I’m not wearing one. Who is inside my solar?” </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lord Littlefinger.” Podrick managed a quick look at his face, then hastily dropped his </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">eyes. “I meant, Lord Petyr. Lord Baelish. The master of coin.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You make him sound a crowd.” The boy hunched down as if struck, making Tyrion feel </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">absurdly guilty. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Petyr was seated on his window seat, languid and elegant in a plush plum-colored </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">doublet and a yellow satin cape, one gloved hand resting on his knee. “The king is fighting </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="471" height="15" font="1">hares with a crossbow,” he said. “The hares are winning. Come see.” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had to stand on his toes to get a look. A dead hare lay on the ground below; </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">another, long ears twitching, was about to expire from the bolt in his side. Spent quarrels lay </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">strewn across the hard-packed earth like straws scattered by a storm. “Now!” Joff shouted. </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The gamesman released the hare he was holding, and he went bounding off. Joffrey jerked the </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">trigger on the crossbow. The bolt missed by two feet. The hare stood on his hind legs and </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">twitched his nose at the king. Cursing, Joff spun the wheel to winch back his string, but the </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">animal was gone before he was loaded. “Another!” The gamesman reached into the hutch. </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">This one made a brown streak against the stones, while Joffrey’s hurried shot almost took Ser </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">Preston in the groin. </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="590" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger turned away. “Boy, are you fond of potted hare?” he asked Podrick Payne. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Pod stared at the visitor’s boots, lovely things of red-dyed leather ornamented with black </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">scrollwork. “To eat, my lord?” </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Invest in pots,” Littlefinger advised. “Hares will soon overrun the castle. We’ll be eating </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="129" height="15" font="1">hare thrice a day.” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Better than rats on a skewer,” said Tyrion. “Pod, leave us. Unless Lord Petyr would care </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">for some refreshment?” </text>

<page number="145" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Thank you, but no.” Littlefinger flashed his mocking smile. “Drink with the dwarf, it’s </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">said, and you wake up walking the Wall. Black brings out my unhealthy pallor.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>Have no fear, my lord</i>, Tyrion thought, <i>it’s not the Wall I have in mind for you.</i> He seated </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">himself in a high chair piled with cushions and said, “You look very elegant today, my lord.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“I’m wounded. I strive to look elegant <i>every</i> day.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="152" height="15" font="1">“Is the doublet new?” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="213" height="15" font="1">“It is. You’re most observant.” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“Plum and yellow. Are those the colors of your House?” </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="611" height="15" font="1">“No. But a man gets bored wearing the same colors day in and day out, or so I’ve found.” </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="242" height="15" font="1">“That’s a handsome knife as well.” </text>
<text top="344" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Is it?” There was mischief in Littlefinger’s eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">casually, as if he had never seen it before. “Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle </text>
<text top="383" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">plain, though. It’s yours, if you would like it.” </text>
<text top="408" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Mine?” Tyrion gave him a long look. “No. I think not. Never mine.” <i>He knows, the </i></text>
<text top="428" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="5"><i>insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know, and he thinks that I cannot touch him.</i> </text>
<text top="453" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">If ever truly a man had armored himself in gold, it was Petyr Baelish, not Jaime </text>
<text top="472" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Lannister. Jaime’s famous armor was but gilded  steel,  but  Littlefinger,  ah . . . Tyrion  had </text>
<text top="492" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">learned a few things about sweet Petyr, to his growing disquiet. </text>
<text top="517" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ten years ago, Jon Arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs, where Lord Petyr </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three times as much as any of the king’s other </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">collectors. King Robert had been a prodigious spender. A man like Petyr Baelish, who had a </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gift for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third, was invaluable to his Hand. </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger’s rise had been arrow-swift. Within three years of his coming to court, he was </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">master of coin and a member of the small council, and today the crown’s revenues were ten </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor . . . though the crown’s debts had </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="383" height="15" font="1">grown vast as well. A master juggler was Petyr Baelish. </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Oh, he was clever. He did not simply collect the gold and lock it in a treasure vault, no. </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">He paid the king’s debts in promises, and put the king’s gold to work. He bought wagons, </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">shops, ships, houses. He bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scarce. He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from Lys, stored it, </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moved it, dyed it, sold it. The golden dragons bred and multiplied, and Littlefinger lent them </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">out and brought them home with hatchlings. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And in the process, he moved his own men into place. The Keepers of the Keys were his, </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all four. The King’s Counter and the King’s Scales were men he’d named. The officers in </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">charge of all three mints. Harbormasters, tax farmers, customs sergeants, wool factors, toll </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">collectors, pursers, wine factors; nine of every ten belonged to Littlefinger. They were men of </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">middling birth, by and large; merchants’ sons, lesser lordlings, sometimes even foreigners, but </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">judging from their results, far more able than their highborn predecessors. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone’s friend, always able to find </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage. </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>But do I dare touch him?</i> Tyrion wondered. <i>Even if he is a traitor?</i> He was not at all </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">certain he could, least of all now, while the war raged. Given time, he could replace </text>
<text top="1065" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger’s men with his own in key positions, but . . . </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="611" height="15" font="1">A shout rang up from the yard. “Ah, His Grace has killed a hare,” Lord Baelish observed. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No doubt a slow one,” Tyrion said. “My lord, you were fostered at Riverrun. I’ve heard </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">it said that you grew close to the Tullys.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="284" height="15" font="1">“You might say so. The girls especially.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="99" height="15" font="1">“How close?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">“I had their maidenhoods. Is that close enough?” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The lie—Tyrion was fairly certain it was a lie—was delivered with such an air of </text>
<text top="269" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">nonchalance that one could almost believe it. Could it have been Catelyn Stark who lied? </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">About her defloration, and the dagger as well? The longer he lived, the more Tyrion realized </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that nothing was simple and little was true. “Lord Hoster’s daughters do not love me,” he </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">confessed. “I doubt they would listen to any proposal I might make. Yet coming from you, the </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">same words might fall more sweetly on their ears.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That would depend on the words. If you mean to offer Sansa in return for your brother, </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">waste someone else’s time. Joffrey will never surrender his plaything, and Lady Catelyn is not </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="418" height="15" font="1">so great a fool as to barter the Kingslayer for a slip of a girl.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“I mean to have Arya as well. I have men searching.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="186" height="15" font="1">“Searching is not finding.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ll keep that in mind, my lord. In any case, it was Lady Lysa I hoped you might sway. </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">For her, I have a sweeter offer.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lysa is more tractable than Catelyn, true . . . but also more fearful, and I understand she </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">hates you.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“She believes she has good reason. When I was her guest in the Eyrie, she insisted that </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">I’d murdered her husband and was not inclined to listen to denials.” He leaned forward. “If I </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">gave her Jon Arryn’s true killer, she might think more kindly of me.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That made Littlefinger sit up. “True killer? I confess, you make me curious. Who do you </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">propose?” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was Tyrion’s turn to smile. “Gifts I give my friends, freely. Lysa Arryn would need to </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">understand that.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">“Is it her friendship you require, or her swords?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="56" height="15" font="1">“Both.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger stroked the neat spike of his beard. “Lysa has woes of her own. Clansmen </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">raiding out of the Mountains of the Moon, in greater numbers than ever before . . . and better </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">armed.” </text>
<text top="843" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Distressing,” said Tyrion Lannister, who had armed them. “I could help her with that. A </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">word from me . . .” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="265" height="15" font="1">“And what would this word cost her?” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="575" height="15" font="1">“I want Lady Lysa and her son to acclaim Joffrey as king, to swear fealty, and to—” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“—make war on the Starks and Tullys?” Littlefinger shook his head. “There’s the roach </text>
<text top="957" left="139" width="542" height="15" font="1">in your pudding, Lannister. Lysa will never send her knights against Riverrun.” </text>
<text top="982" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Nor would I ask it. We have no lack of enemies. I’ll use her power to oppose Lord </text>
<text top="1002" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Renly, or Lord Stannis, should he stir from Dragonstone. In return, I will give her justice for </text>
<text top="1021" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jon Arryn and peace in the Vale. I will even name that appalling child of hers Warden of the </text>
<text top="1041" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">East, as his father was before him.” <i>I want to see him fly</i>, a boy’s voice whispered faintly in </text>
<text top="1060" left="139" width="415" height="15" font="1">memory. “And to seal the bargain, I will give her my niece.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He had the pleasure of seeing a look of genuine surprise in Petyr Baelish’s grey-green </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">eyes. “Myrcella?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When she comes of age, she can wed little Lord Robert. Until such time, she’ll be Lady </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">Lysa’s ward at the Eyrie.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“And what does Her Grace the queen think of this ploy?” When Tyrion shrugged, </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger burst into laughter. “I thought not. You’re a dangerous little man, Lannister. Yes, </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">I could sing this song to Lysa.” Again the sly smile, the mischief in his glance. “If I cared to.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="539" height="15" font="1">Tyrion nodded, waiting, knowing Littlefinger could never abide a long silence. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“So,” Lord Petyr continued after a pause, utterly unabashed, “what’s in your pot for me?” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="91" height="15" font="1">“Harrenhal.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was interesting to watch his face. Lord Petyr’s father had been the smallest of small </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">lords, his grandfather a landless hedge knight; by birth, he held no more than a few stony </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">acres on the windswept shore of the Fingers. Harrenhal was one of the richest plums in the </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Seven Kingdoms, its lands broad and rich and fertile, its great castle as formidable as any in </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the realm . . . and so large as to dwarf Riverrun, where Petyr Baelish had been fostered by </text>

<text top="475" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger took a moment to adjust the drape of his cape, but Tyrion had seen the flash </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of hunger in those sly cat’s eyes. <i>I have him</i>, he knew. “Harrenhal is cursed,” Lord Petyr said </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="265" height="15" font="1">after a moment, trying to sound bored. </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then raze it to the ground and build anew to suit yourself. You’ll have no lack of coin. I </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mean to make you liege lord of the Trident. These river lords have proven they cannot be </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">trusted. Let them do you fealty for their lands.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="134" height="15" font="1">“Even the Tullys?” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="328" height="15" font="1">“If there are any Tullys left when we are done.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb. He </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was  <i>trying</i> to watch for bees, but the honey was so sweet. “Harrenhal and all its lands and </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">incomes,” he mused. “With a stroke, you’d make me one of the greatest lords in the realm. </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">Not that I’m ungrateful, my lord, but—why?” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="410" height="15" font="1">“You served my sister well in the matter of the succession.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“As did Janos Slynt. On whom this same castle of Harrenhal was quite recently </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">bestowed—only to be snatched away when he was no longer of use.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion laughed. “You have me, my lord. What can I say? I need you to deliver the Lady </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lysa. I did not need Janos Slynt.” He gave a crooked shrug. “I’d sooner have you seated in </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="502" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal than Renly seated on the Iron Throne. What could be plainer?” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What indeed. You realize that I may need to bed Lysa Arryn again to get her consent to </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">this marriage?” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">“I have little doubt you’ll be equal to the task.” </text>
<text top="940" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I once told Ned Stark that when you find yourself naked with an ugly woman, the only </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thing to do is close your eyes and get on with it.” Littlefinger steepled his fingers and gazed </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">into Tyrion’s mismatched eyes. “Give me a fortnight to conclude my affairs and arrange for a </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="148" height="15" font="5"><i>Two</i>, thought Tyrion. </text>

<text top="232" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">to visit Shae tonight. He was pleasantly surprised when Galt of the Stone Crows informed him </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Is that a crow I hear, calling the raven black? Or would you sooner not hear what I’ve </text>

<text top="341" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">Varys giggled. “Perhaps my little birds have told me.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="376" height="15" font="1">“Have they, indeed?” He wanted to hear this. “Go on.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The Dornishmen thus far have held aloof from these wars. Doran Martell has called his </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">banners, but no more. His hatred for House Lannister is well known, and it is commonly </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="415" height="15" font="1">thought he will join Lord Renly. You wish to dissuade him.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“All this is obvious,” said Tyrion. </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The only puzzle is what you might have offered for his allegiance. The prince is a </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="494" height="15" font="1">sentimental man, and he still mourns his sister Elia and her sweet babe.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="620" height="15" font="1">“My father once told me that a lord never lets sentiment get in the way of </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ambition . . . and it happens we have an empty seat on the small council, now that Lord Janos </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="145" height="15" font="1">has taken the black.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A council seat is not to be despised,” Varys admitted, “yet will it be enough to make a </text>

<text top="634" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why forget?” Tyrion smiled. “I’ve promised to deliver his sister’s killers, alive or dead, </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">as he prefers. <i>After</i> the war is done, to be sure.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Varys gave him a shrewd look. “My little birds tell me that Princess Elia cried </text>

<text top="723" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Is a secret still a secret if everyone knows it?” In Casterly Rock, it was common </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knowledge that Gregor Clegane had killed Elia and her babe. They said he had raped the </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">princess with her son’s blood and brains still on his hands. </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“<i>This</i> secret is your lord father’s sworn man.” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My father would be the first to tell you that fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one </text>

<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Varys stroked a powdered cheek. “And if Prince Doran demands the blood of the lord </text>

<text top="901" left="171" width="548" height="15" font="1">“Robert Baratheon led the rebellion. All commands came from him, in the end.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="254" height="15" font="1">“Robert was not at King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“Neither was Doran Martell.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“So. Blood for his pride, a chair for his ambition. Gold and land, that goes without </text>

<text top="129" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Since you put it that way—yes. Tommen. You could scarcely offer Myrcella to Doran </text>

<text top="174" left="171" width="527" height="15" font="1">“Remind me never to play these guessing games with you again. You cheat.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="1">“Prince Tommen is a good boy.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If I pry him away from Cersei and Joffrey while he’s still young, he may even grow to </text>

<text top="269" left="171" width="140" height="15" font="1">“And a good king?” </text>

<text top="319" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And Tommen is heir, should anything ill befall His Grace. Tommen, whose nature is so </text>

<text top="363" left="171" width="263" height="15" font="1">“You have a suspicious mind, Varys.” </text>
<text top="389" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I shall take that as a tribute, my lord. In any case, Prince Doran will hardly be insensible </text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">of the great honor you do him. Very deftly done, I would say . . . but for one small flaw.” </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="260" height="15" font="1">The dwarf laughed. “Named Cersei?” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“What avails statecraft against the love of a mother for the sweet fruit of her womb? </text>
<text top="478" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Perhaps, for the glory of her House and the safety of the realm, the queen might be persuaded </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">to send away Tommen or Myrcella. But both of them? Surely not.” </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="340" height="15" font="1">“What Cersei does not know will never hurt me.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="546" height="15" font="1">“And if Her Grace were to discover your intentions before your plans are ripe?” </text>

<text top="718" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The words were the same on the hundredth reading as they’d been on the first, when </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Sansa had discovered the folded sheet of parchment beneath her pillow. She did not know </text>
<text top="757" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">how it had gotten there or who had sent it. The note was unsigned, unsealed, and the hand </text>
<text top="776" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">unfamiliar. She crushed the parchment to her chest and whispered the words to herself. </text>
<text top="796" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">“Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home,” she breathed, ever so faintly. </text>
<text top="821" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">What could it mean? Should she take it to the queen to prove that she was being good? </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Nervously, she rubbed her stomach. The angry purple bruise Ser Meryn had given her had </text>
<text top="860" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">faded to an ugly yellow, but still hurt. His fist had been mailed when he hit her. It was her </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">own fault. She must learn to hide her feelings better, so as not to anger Joffrey. When she </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heard that the Imp had sent Lord Slynt to the Wall, she had forgotten herself and said, “I hope </text>
<text top="918" left="139" width="357" height="15" font="1">the Others get him.” The king had not been pleased. </text>

<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa had prayed so hard. Could this be her answer at last, a true knight sent to save her? </text>
<text top="988" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Perhaps it was one of the Redwyne twins, or bold Ser Balon Swann . . . or even Beric </text>

<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the door opened, she hurriedly stuffed the note under her sheet and sat on it. It was </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">her bedmaid, the mousy one with the limp brown hair. “What do you want?” Sansa </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">demanded. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="285" height="15" font="1">“Will milady be wanting a bath tonight?” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="559" height="15" font="1">“A fire, I think . . . I feel a chill.” She was shivering, though the day had been hot. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“As you wish.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sansa watched the girl suspiciously. Had she seen the note? Had she put it under the </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pillow? It did not seem likely; she seemed a stupid girl, not one you’d want delivering secret </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">notes, but Sansa did not know her. The queen had her servants changed every fortnight, to </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">make certain none of them befriended her. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">When a fire was blazing in the hearth, Sansa thanked the maid curtly and ordered her out. </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The girl was quick to obey, as ever, but Sansa decided there was something sly about her </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eyes. Doubtless, she was scurrying off to report to the queen, or maybe Varys. All her maids </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">spied on her, she was certain. </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Once alone, she thrust the note in the flames, watching the parchment curl and blacken. </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Come to the godswood tonight, if you want to go home.</i> She drifted to her window. Below, she </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could see a short knight in moon-pale armor and a heavy white cloak pacing the drawbridge. </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">From his height, it could only be Ser Preston Greenfield. The queen had given her freedom of </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the castle, but even so, he would want to know where she was going if she tried to leave </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Maegor’s Holdfast at this time of night. What was she to tell him? Suddenly she was glad she </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">had burned the note. </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">She unlaced her gown and crawled into her bed, but she did not sleep. <i>Was he still there?</i> </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she wondered. <i>How long will he wait?</i> It was so cruel, to send her a note and tell her nothing. </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="330" height="15" font="1">The thoughts went round and round in her head. </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">If only she had someone to tell her what to do. She missed Septa Mordane, and even </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">more Jeyne Poole, her truest friend. The septa had lost her head with the rest, for the crime of </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">serving House Stark. Sansa did not know what had happened to Jeyne, who had disappeared </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from her rooms afterward, never to be mentioned again. She tried not to think of them too </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">often, yet sometimes the memories came unbidden, and then it was hard to hold back the </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">tears. Once in a while, Sansa even missed her sister. By now Arya was safe back in </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Winterfell, dancing and sewing, playing with Bran and baby Rickon, even riding through the </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">winter town if she liked. Sansa was allowed to go riding too, but only in the bailey, and it got </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="260" height="15" font="1">boring going round in a circle all day. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She was wide-awake when she heard the shouting. Distant at first, then growing louder. </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Many voices yelling together. She could not make out the words. And there were horses as </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">well, and pounding feet, shouts of command. She crept to her window and saw men running </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on the walls, carrying spears and torches. <i>Go back to your bed</i>, Sansa told herself, <i>this is </i></text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>nothing that concerns you, just some new trouble out in the city.</i> The talk at the wells had all </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been of troubles in the city of late. People were crowding in, running from the war, and many </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">had no way to live save by robbing and killing each other. <i>Go to bed.</i> </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But when she looked, the white knight was gone, the bridge across the dry moat down </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="1">but undefended. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa turned away without thinking and ran to her wardrobe. <i>Oh, what am I doing?</i> she </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">asked herself as she dressed. <i>This is madness.</i> She could see the lights of many torches on the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">curtain walls. Had Stannis and Renly come at last to kill Joffrey and claim their brother’s </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">throne? If so, the guards would raise the drawbridge, cutting off Maegor’s Holdfast from the </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">outer castle. Sansa threw a plain grey cloak over her shoulders and picked up the knife she </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">used to cut her meat. <i>If it is some trap, better that I die than let them hurt me more</i>, she told </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="290" height="15" font="1">herself. She hid the blade under her cloak. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">A column of red-cloaked swordsmen ran past as she slipped out into the night. She </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">waited until they were well past before she darted across the undefended drawbridge. In the </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">yard, men were buckling on swordbelts and cinching the saddles of their horses. She glimpsed </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ser Preston near the stables with three others of the Kingsguard, white cloaks bright as the </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moon as they helped Joffrey into his armor. Her breath caught in her throat when she saw the </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">king. Thankfully, he did not see her. He was shouting for his sword and crossbow. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The noise receded as she moved deeper into the castle, never daring to look back for fear </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that Joffrey might be watching . . . or worse, following. The serpentine steps twisted ahead, </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">striped by bars of flickering light from the narrow windows above. Sansa was panting by the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">time she reached the top. She ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed herself against a </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wall to catch her breath. When something brushed against her leg, she almost jumped out of </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her skin, but it was only a cat, a ragged black tom with a chewed-off ear. The creature spit at </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">her and leapt away. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By the time she reached the godswood, the noises had faded to a faint rattle of steel and a </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">distant shouting. Sansa pulled her cloak tighter. The air was rich with the smells of earth and </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">leaf.  <i>Lady would have liked this place</i>, she thought. There was something wild about a </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">godswood; even here, in the heart of the castle at the heart of the city, you could feel the old </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">gods watching with a thousand unseen eyes. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa had favored her mother’s gods over her father’s. She loved the statues, the pictures </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in leaded glass, the fragrance of burning incense, the septons with their robes and crystals, the </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">magical play of the rainbows over altars inlaid with mother-of-pearl and onyx and lapis lazuli. </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Yet she could not deny that the godswood had a certain power too. Especially by night. <i>Help </i></text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="5"><i>me</i>, she prayed, <i>send me a friend, a true knight to champion me . . .</i> </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">She moved from tree to tree, feeling the roughness of the bark beneath her fingers. </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Leaves brushed at her cheeks. Had she come too late? He would not have left so soon, would </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">he? Or had he even been here? Dare she risk calling out? It seemed so hushed and still </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">here . . . </text>
<text top="800" left="171" width="261" height="15" font="1">“I feared you would not come, child.” </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa whirled. A man stepped out of the shadows, heavyset, thick of neck, shambling. </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He wore a dark grey robe with the cowl pulled forward, but when a thin sliver of moonlight </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">touched his cheek, she knew him at once by the blotchy skin and web of broken veins </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">beneath. “Ser Dontos,” she breathed, heartbroken. “Was it you?” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lady.” When he moved closer, she could smell the sour stench of wine on his </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">breath. “Me.” He reached out a hand. </text>
<text top="953" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Sansa shrank back. “<i>Don’t!</i>” She slid her hand under her cloak, to her hidden knife. </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">“What . . . what do you want with me?” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">“Only to help you,” Dontos said, “as you helped me.” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">“You’re drunk, aren’t you?” </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Only one cup of wine, to help my courage. If they catch me now, they’ll strip the skin </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">off my back.” </text>
</page>
<page number="152" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>And what will they do to me?</i> Sansa found herself thinking of Lady again. She could </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smell out falsehood, she <i>could</i>, but she was dead, Father had killed her, on account of Arya. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="397" height="15" font="1">She drew the knife and held it before her with both hands. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">“Are you going to stab me?” Dontos asked. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“I will,” she said. “Tell me who sent you.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="393" height="15" font="1">“No one, sweet lady. I swear it on my honor as a knight.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A knight?” Joffrey had decreed that he was to be a knight no longer, only a fool, lower </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">even than Moon Boy. “I prayed to the gods for a knight to come save me,” she said. “I prayed </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="405" height="15" font="1">and prayed. Why would they send me a drunken old fool?” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I deserve that, though . . . I know it’s queer, but . . . all those years I was a knight, I was </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">truly a fool, and now that I am a fool I think . . . I think I may find it in me to be a knight </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">again, sweet lady. And all because of you . . . your grace, your courage. You saved me, not </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only from Joffrey, but from myself.” His voice dropped. “The singers say there was another </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="1">fool once who was the greatest knight of all . . .” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">“<i>Florian</i>,” Sansa whispered. A shiver went through her. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sweet lady, I would be your Florian,” Dontos said humbly, falling to his knees before </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="30" height="15" font="1">her. </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Slowly, Sansa lowered the knife. Her head seemed terribly light, as if she were floating. </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>This is madness, to trust myself to this drunkard, but if I turn away will the chance ever come </i></text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="382" height="15" font="5"><i>again?</i> “How . . . how would you do it? Get me away?” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Dontos raised his face to her. “Taking you from the castle, that will be the hardest. </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Once you’re out, there are ships that would take you home. I’d need to find the coin and make </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="1">the arrangements, that’s all.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“Could we go now?” she asked, hardly daring to hope. </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This very night? No, my lady, I fear not. First I must find a sure way to get you from the </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">castle when the hour is ripe. It will not be easy, nor quick. They watch me as well.” He licked </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="357" height="15" font="1">his lips nervously. “Will you put away your blade?” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="371" height="15" font="1">Sansa slipped the knife beneath her cloak. “Rise, ser.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Thank you, sweet lady.” Ser Dontos lurched clumsily to his feet, and brushed earth and </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">leaves from his knees. “Your lord father was as true a man as the realm has ever known, but I </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stood by and let them slay him. I said nothing, did nothing . . . and yet, when Joffrey would </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have slain me, you spoke up. Lady, I have never been a hero, no Ryam Redwyne or Barristan </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Bold. I’ve won no tourneys, no renown in war . . . but I was a knight once, and you have </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">helped me remember what that meant. My life is a poor thing, but it is yours.” Ser Dontos </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">placed a hand on the gnarled bole of the heart tree. He was shaking, she saw. “I vow, with </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="399" height="15" font="1">your father’s gods as witness, that I shall send you home.” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>He swore.</i> A solemn oath, before the gods. “Then . . . I will put myself in your hands, ser. </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="527" height="15" font="1">But how will I know, when it is time to go? Will you send me another note?” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Dontos glanced about anxiously. “The risk is too great. You must come here, to the </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">godswood. As often as you can. This is the safest place. The <i>only</i> safe place. Nowhere else. </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Not in your chambers nor mine nor on the steps nor in the yard, even if it seems we are alone. </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="502" height="15" font="1">The stones have ears in the Red Keep, and only here may we talk freely.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="287" height="15" font="1">“Only here,” Sansa said. “I’ll remember.” </text>
</page>
<page number="153" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And if I should seem cruel or mocking or indifferent when men are watching, forgive </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">me, child. I have a role to play, and you must do the same. One misstep and our heads will </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="255" height="15" font="1">adorn the walls as did your father’s.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">She nodded. “I understand.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="499" height="15" font="1">“You will need to be brave and strong . . . and patient, patient above all.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="603" height="15" font="1">“I will be,” she promised, “but . . . please . . . make it as soon as you can. I’m afraid . . .” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“So am I,” Ser Dontos said, smiling wanly. “And now you must go, before you are </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="1">missed.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="213" height="15" font="1">“You will not come with me?” </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="264" height="15" font="1">“Better if we are never seen together.” </text>
<text top="338" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Nodding, Sansa took a step . . . then spun back, nervous, and softly laid a kiss on his </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">cheek, her eyes closed. “My Florian,” she whispered. “The gods heard my prayer.” </text>
<text top="383" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She flew along the river walk, past the small kitchen, and through the pig yard, her </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hurried footsteps lost beneath the squealing of the hogs in their pens. <i>Home</i>, she thought, </text>
<text top="422" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>home, he is going to take me home, he’ll keep me safe, my Florian.</i> The songs about Florian </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="544" height="15" font="1">and Jonquil were her very favorites. <i>Florian was homely too, though not so old.</i> </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She was racing headlong down the serpentine steps when a man lurched out of a hidden </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">doorway. Sansa caromed into him and lost her balance. Iron fingers caught her by the wrist </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before she could fall, and a deep voice rasped at her. “It’s a long roll down the serpentine, </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="634" height="15" font="1">little bird. Want to kill us both?” His laughter was rough as a saw on stone. “Maybe you do.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>The Hound.</i> “No, my lord, pardons, I’d never.” Sansa averted her eyes but it was too late, </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="502" height="15" font="1">he’d seen her face. “Please, you’re hurting me.” She tried to wriggle free. </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And what’s Joff’s little bird doing flying down the serpentine in the black of night?” </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="412" height="15" font="1">When she did not answer, he shook her. “<i>Where were you?</i>” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The g-g-godswood, my lord,” she said, not daring to lie. “Praying . . . praying for my </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="399" height="15" font="1">father, and . . . for the king, praying that he’d not be hurt.” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Think I’m so drunk that I’d believe <i>that?</i>” He let go his grip on her arm, swaying </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slightly as he stood, stripes of light and darkness falling across his terrible burnt face. “You </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">look almost a woman . . . face, teats, and you’re taller too, almost . . . ah, you’re still a stupid </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">little bird, aren’t you? Singing all the songs they taught you . . . sing me a song, why don’t </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">you? Go on. Sing to me. Some song about knights and fair maids. You like knights, don’t </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">you?” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="319" height="15" font="1">He was scaring her. “T-true knights, my lord.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>True</i> knights,” he mocked. “And I’m no lord, no more than I’m a knight. Do I need to </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beat that into you?” Clegane reeled and almost fell. “<i>Gods</i>,” he swore, “too much wine. Do </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">you like wine, little bird? <i>True</i> wine? A flagon of sour red, dark as blood, all a man needs. Or </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a woman.” He laughed, shook his head. “Drunk as a dog, damn me. You come now. Back to </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">your cage, little bird. I’ll take you there. Keep you safe for the king.” The Hound gave her a </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">push, oddly gentle, and followed her down the steps. By the time they reached the bottom, he </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="524" height="15" font="1">had lapsed back into a brooding silence, as if he had forgotten she was there. </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When they reached Maegor’s Holdfast, she was alarmed to see that it was Ser Boros </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Blount who now held the bridge. His high white helm turned stiffly at the sound of their </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">footsteps. Sansa flinched away from his gaze. Ser Boros was the worst of the Kingsguard, an </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="346" height="15" font="1">ugly man with a foul temper, all scowls and jowls. </text>
</page>
<page number="154" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That one is nothing to fear, girl.” The Hound laid a heavy hand on her shoulder. “Paint </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="316" height="15" font="1">stripes on a toad, he does not become a tiger.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="287" height="15" font="1">Ser Boros lifted his visor. “Ser, where—” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="565" height="15" font="1">“Fuck your <i>ser</i>, Boros. You’re the knight, not me. I’m the king’s dog, remember?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="296" height="15" font="1">“The king was looking for his dog earlier.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="609" height="15" font="1">“The dog was drinking. It was your night to shield him, ser. You and my other <i>brothers</i>.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="594" height="15" font="1">Ser Boros turned to Sansa. “How is it you are not in your chambers at this hour, lady?” </text>
<text top="274" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I went to the godswood to pray for the safety of the king.” The lie sounded better this </text>

<text top="344" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Fools at the gate,” Ser Boros admitted. “Some loose tongues spread tales of the </text>

<text top="408" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">“A brave boy,” Clegane said, mouth twitching. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Let us see how brave he is when he faces my brother</i>, Sansa thought. The Hound escorted </text>

<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fires had not spread. “They would have burned the lake if they could have,” Gendry had said, </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Arya knew he was right. On the night of their escape, the flames of the burning town had </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">shimmered so brightly on the water that it had seemed that the lake <i>was</i> afire. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">When they finally summoned the nerve to steal back into the ruins the next night, nothing </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remained but blackened stones, the hollow shells of houses, and corpses. In some places wisps </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of pale smoke still rose from the ashes. Hot Pie had pleaded with them not to go back, and </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lommy called them fools and swore that Ser Amory would catch them and kill them too, but </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lorch and his men had long gone by the time they reached the holdfast. They found the gates </text>

<text top="363" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">look was enough for Gendry. “They’re killed, every one,” he said. “And dogs have been at </text>

<text top="600" left="139" width="364" height="15" font="1">wondered how many it had taken to bring him down. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He was going to take me home</i>, she thought as they dug the old man’s hole. There were </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">too many dead to bury them all, but Yoren at least must have a grave, Arya had insisted. <i>He </i></text>

<text top="708" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was Gendry who thought of the lord’s towerhouse and the three that Yoren had sent to </text>

<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">second-story door reached by a ladder. Once that had been pulled inside, Ser Amory’s men </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could not get at them. The Lannisters had piled brush around the tower’s base and set it afire, </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but the stone would not burn, and Lorch did not have the patience to starve them out. Cutjack </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">opened the door at Gendry’s shout, and when Kurz said they’d be better pressing on north </text>

<text top="850" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Well, this village was no Winterfell, but those thatched roofs promised warmth and </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shelter and maybe even food, if they were bold enough to risk them. <i>Unless it’s Lorch there. </i></text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">placid blue waters, to feel clean again, to swim and splash and bask in the sun. But she dare </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not take off her clothes where the others could see, not even to wash them. At the end of the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">day she would often sit on a rock and dangle her feet in the cool water. She had finally thrown </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">away her cracked and rotted shoes. Walking barefoot was hard at first, but the blisters had </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">finally broken, the cuts had healed, and her soles had turned to leather. The mud was nice </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">between her toes, and she liked to feel the earth underfoot when she walked. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">From up here, she could see a small wooded island off to the northeast. Thirty yards from </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shore, three black swans were gliding over the water, so serene . . . no one had told them that </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">war had come, and they cared nothing for burning towns and butchered men. She stared at </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them with yearning. Part of her wanted to be a swan. The other part wanted to eat one. She </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had broken her fast on some acorn paste and a handful of bugs. Bugs weren’t so bad when </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you got used to them. Worms were worse, but still not as bad as the pain in your belly after </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">days without food. Finding bugs was easy, all you had to do was kick over a rock. Arya had </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eaten a bug once when she was little, just to make Sansa screech, so she hadn’t been afraid to </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eat another. Weasel wasn’t either, but Hot Pie retched up the beetle he tried to swallow, and </text>
<text top="421" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lommy and Gendry wouldn’t even try. Yesterday Gendry had caught a frog and shared it </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with Lommy, and, a few days before, Hot Pie had found blackberries and stripped the bush </text>
<text top="460" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bare, but mostly they had been living on water and acorns. Kurz had told them how to use </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">rocks and make a kind of acorn paste. It tasted awful. </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She wished the poacher hadn’t died. He’d known more about the woods than all the rest </text>
<text top="524" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of them together, but he’d taken an arrow through the shoulder pulling in the ladder at the </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">towerhouse. Tarber had packed it with mud and moss from the lake, and for a day or two </text>
<text top="563" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Kurz swore the wound was nothing, even though the flesh of his throat was turning dark while </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">angry red welts crept up his jaw and down his chest. Then one morning he couldn’t find the </text>
<text top="602" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">strength to get up, and by the next he was dead. </text>
<text top="627" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They buried him under a mound of stones, and Cutjack had claimed his sword and </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hunting horn, while Tarber helped himself to bow and boots and knife. They’d taken it all </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when they left. At first they thought the two had just gone hunting, that they’d soon return </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with game and feed them all. But they waited and waited, until finally Gendry made them </text>
<text top="705" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">move on. Maybe Tarber and Cutjack figured they would stand a better chance without a </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gaggle of orphan boys to herd along. They probably would too, but that didn’t stop her hating </text>
<text top="744" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">them for leaving. </text>
<text top="769" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beneath her tree, Hot Pie barked like a dog. Kurz had told them to use animal sounds to </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">signal to each other. An old poacher’s trick, he’d said, but he’d died before he could teach </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them how to make the sounds right. Hot Pie’s birdcalls were awful. His dog was better, but </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">not much. </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya hopped from the high branch to one beneath it, her hands out for balance. <i>A water </i></text>

<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hopped down to a larger limb, then swung hand over hand through the tangle of leaves until </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">she reached the trunk. The bark was rough beneath her fingers, against her toes. She </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="525" height="15" font="1">descended quickly, jumping down the final six feet, rolling when she landed. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Gendry gave her a hand to pull her up. “You were up there a long time. What could you </text>

<text top="1000" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A fishing village, just a little place, north along the shore. Twenty-six thatch roofs and </text>

<text top="1045" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">At the sound of her voice, Weasel came creeping out from the bushes. Lommy had </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on calling her the crying girl after she finally stopped crying. Her mouth was filthy. Arya </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="1">hoped she hadn’t been eating mud again. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">“Did you see people?” asked Gendry. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Mostly just roofs,” Arya admitted, “but some chimneys were smoking, and I heard a </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">horse.” The Weasel put her arms around her leg, clutching tight. Sometimes she did that now. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If there’s people, there’s food,” Hot Pie said, too loudly. Gendry was always telling him </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">to be more quiet, but it never did any good. “Might be they’d give us some.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">“Might be they’d kill us too,” Gendry said. </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“Not if we yielded,” Hot Pie said hopefully. </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="218" height="15" font="1">“Now you sound like Lommy.” </text>
<text top="338" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lommy Greenhands sat propped up between two thick roots at the foot of an oak. A </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">spear had taken him through his left calf during the fight at the holdfast. By the end of the </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">next day, he had to limp along one-legged with an arm around Gendry, and now he couldn’t </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">even do <i>that</i>. They’d hacked branches off trees to make a litter for him, but it was slow, hard </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">work carrying him along, and he whimpered every time they jounced him. </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“We have to yield,” he said. “That’s what Yoren should have done. He should have </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="223" height="15" font="1">opened the gates like they said.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya was sick of Lommy going on about how Yoren should have yielded. It was all he </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="497" height="15" font="1">talked about when they carried him, that and his leg and his empty belly. </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie agreed. “They <i>told</i> Yoren to open the gates, they told him in the king’s name. </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">You have to do what they tell you in the king’s name. It was that stinky old man’s fault. If </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="1">he’d of yielded, they would have left us be.” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Gendry frowned. “Knights and lordlings, they take each other captive and pay ransoms, </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but they don’t care if the likes of you yield or not.” He turned to Arya. “What else did you </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">see?” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If it’s a fishing village, they’d sell us fish, I bet,” said Hot Pie. The lake teemed with </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fresh fish, but they had nothing to catch them with. Arya had tried to use her hands, the way </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she’d seen Koss do, but fish were quicker than pigeons and the water played tricks on her </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="39" height="15" font="1">eyes. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I don’t know about fish.” Arya tugged at the Weasel’s matted hair, thinking it might be </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="545" height="15" font="1">best to hack it off. “There’s crows down by the water. Something’s dead there.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="533" height="15" font="1">“Fish, washed up on shore,” Hot Pie said. “If the crows eat it, I bet we could.” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We should catch some crows, we could eat <i>them</i>,” said Lommy. “We could make a fire </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="1">and roast them like chickens.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Gendry looked fierce when he scowled. His beard had grown in thick and black as briar. </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">“I said, no fires.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="364" height="15" font="1">“Lommy’s <i>hungry</i>,” Hot Pie whined, “and I am too.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="213" height="15" font="1">“We’re all hungry,” said Arya. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="417" height="15" font="1">“<i>You’re</i> not,” Lommy spat from the ground. “Worm breath.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya could have kicked him in his wound. “I <i>said</i> I’d dig worms for you too, if you </text>
<text top="996" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">wanted.” </text>
<text top="1021" left="171" width="551" height="15" font="1">Lommy made a disgusted face. “If it wasn’t for my leg, I’d hunt us some boars.” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Some boars,” she mocked. “You need a boarspear to hunt boars, and horses and dogs, </text>
<text top="1066" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and men to flush the boar from its lair.” Her father had hunted boar in the wolfswood with </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mordane said boar hunting was not for ladies, and Mother only promised that when she was </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">older she might have her own hawk. She was older now, but if she had a hawk she’d <i>eat</i> it. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="385" height="15" font="1">“What do <i>you</i> know about hunting boars?” said Hot Pie. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="123" height="15" font="1">“More than you.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Gendry was in no mood to hear it. “Quiet, both of you, I need to think what to do.” He </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">always looked pained when he tried to think, like it hurt him something fierce. </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="155" height="15" font="1">“Yield,” Lommy said. </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I told you to shut up about the yielding. We don’t even know who’s in there. Maybe we </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">can steal some food.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="593" height="15" font="1">“Lommy could steal, if it wasn’t for his leg,” said Hot Pie. “He was a thief in the city.” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="408" height="15" font="1">“A bad thief,” Arya said, “or he wouldn’t have got caught.” </text>
<text top="383" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Gendry squinted up at the sun. “Evenfall will be the best time to sneak in. I’ll go scout </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">come dark.” </text>
<text top="428" left="171" width="307" height="15" font="1">“No, I’ll go,” Arya said. “You’re too noisy.” </text>
<text top="453" left="171" width="344" height="15" font="1">Gendry got that look on his face. “We’ll both go.” </text>
<text top="478" left="171" width="424" height="15" font="1">“Arry should go,” said Lommy. “He’s sneakier than you are.” </text>
<text top="503" left="171" width="163" height="15" font="1">“We’ll <i>both</i> go, I said.” </text>
<text top="528" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“But what if you don’t come back? Hot Pie can’t carry me by himself, you know he </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="71" height="15" font="1">can’t . . .” </text>
<text top="573" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And there’s wolves,” Hot Pie said. “I heard them last night, when I had the watch. They </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">sounded close.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya had heard them too. She’d been asleep in the branches of an elm, but the howling </text>
<text top="637" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had woken her. She’d sat awake for a good hour, listening to them, prickles creeping up her </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">spine. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And you won’t even let us have a fire to keep them off,” Hot Pie said. “It’s not right, </text>
<text top="701" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">leaving us for the wolves.” </text>
<text top="726" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No one is leaving you,” Gendry said in disgust. “Lommy has his spear if the wolves </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">come, and you’ll be with him. We’re just going to go see, that’s all; we’re coming back.” </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Whoever it is, you should yield to them,” Lommy whined. “I need some potion for my </text>
<text top="790" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">leg, it hurts bad.” </text>
<text top="815" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If we see any leg potion, we’ll bring it,” Gendry said. “Arry, let’s go, I want to get near </text>
<text top="835" left="139" width="574" height="15" font="1">before the sun is down. Hot Pie, you keep Weasel here, I don’t want her following.” </text>
<text top="860" left="171" width="188" height="15" font="1">“Last time she kicked me.” </text>
<text top="885" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“<i>I’ll</i> kick you if you don’t keep her here.” Without waiting for an answer, Gendry donned </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">his steel helm and walked off. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya had to scamper to keep up. Gendry was five years older and a foot taller than she </text>
<text top="949" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was, and long of leg as well. For a while he said nothing, just plowed on through the trees </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with an angry look on his face, making too much noise. But finally he stopped and said, “I </text>
<text top="988" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">think Lommy’s going to die.” </text>
<text top="1013" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She was not surprised. Kurz had died of his wound, and he’d been a lot stronger than </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lommy. Whenever it was Arya’s turn to help carry him, she could feel how warm his skin </text>
<text top="1052" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">was, and smell the stink off his leg. “Maybe we could find a maester . . .” </text>

<page number="159" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You only find maesters in castles, and even if we found one, he wouldn’t dirty his hands </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="463" height="15" font="1">on the likes of Lommy.” Gendry ducked under a low-hanging limb. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That’s not true.” Maester Luwin would have helped anyone who came to him, she was </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">certain. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He’s going to die, and the sooner he does it, the better for the rest of us. We should just </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">leave him, like he says. If it was you or me hurt, you know he’d leave us.” They scrambled </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down a steep cut and up the other side, using roots for handholds. “I’m sick of carrying him, </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and I’m sick of all his talk about yielding too. If he could stand up, I’d knock his teeth in. </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="418" height="15" font="1">Lommy’s no use to anyone. That crying girl’s no use either.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You leave Weasel alone, she’s just scared and hungry is all.” Arya glanced back, but the </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="615" height="15" font="1">girl was not following for once. Hot Pie must have grabbed her, like Gendry had told him. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“She’s no use,” Gendry repeated stubbornly. “Her and Hot Pie and Lommy, they’re </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slowing us down, and they’re going to get us killed. You’re the only one of the bunch who’s </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="289" height="15" font="1">good for anything. Even if you are a girl.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">Arya froze in her steps. “<i>I’m not a girl!</i>” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="375" height="15" font="1">“Yes you are. Do you think I’m as stupid as they are?” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="563" height="15" font="1">“No, you’re stupider. The Night’s Watch doesn’t take girls, everyone knows that.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That’s true. I don’t know why Yoren brought you, but he must have had some reason. </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">You’re still a girl.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="81" height="15" font="1">“I am not!” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="340" height="15" font="1">“Then pull out your cock and take a piss. Go on.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">“I don’t need to take a piss. If I wanted to I could.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Liar. You can’t take out your cock because you don’t have one. I never noticed before </text>
<text top="620" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when there were thirty of us, but you always go off in the woods to make your water. You </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="631" height="15" font="1">don’t see Hot Pie doing that, nor me neither. If you’re not a girl, you must be some eunuch.” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="148" height="15" font="1">“<i>You’re</i> the eunuch.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You know I’m not.” Gendry smiled. “You want me to take out my cock and prove it? I </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="202" height="15" font="1">don’t have anything to hide.” </text>
<text top="734" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes you do,” Arya blurted, desperate to escape the subject of the cock she didn’t have. </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">“Those gold cloaks were after you at the inn, and you won’t tell us why.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I wish I knew. I think Yoren knew, but he never told me. Why did you think they were </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">after you, though?” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya bit her lip. She remembered what Yoren had said, the day he had hacked off her </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hair. <i>This lot, half o’ them would turn you over to the queen quick as spit for a pardon and </i></text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>maybe a few silvers. The other half’d do the same, only they’d rape you first.</i> Only Gendry </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="601" height="15" font="1">was different, the queen wanted him too. “I’ll tell you if you’ll tell me,” she said warily. </text>
<text top="907" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I would if I knew, Arry . . . is that really what you’re called, or do you have some girl’s </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">name?” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya glared at the gnarled root by her feet. She realized that the pretense was done. </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gendry knew, and she had nothing in her pants to convince him otherwise. She could draw </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Needle and kill him where he stood, or else trust him. She wasn’t certain she’d be able to kill </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him, even if she tried; he had his own sword, and he was a lot stronger. All that was left was </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="369" height="15" font="1">the truth. “Lommy and Hot Pie can’t know,” she said. </text>
<text top="1054" left="171" width="282" height="15" font="1">“They won’t,” he swore. “Not from me.” </text>
</page>
<page number="160" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="493" height="15" font="1">“Arya.” She raised her eyes to his. “My name is Arya. Of House Stark.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Of House . . .” It took him a moment before he said, “The King’s Hand was named </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">Stark. The one they killed for a traitor.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="301" height="15" font="1">“He was never a traitor. He was my father.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">Gendry’s eyes widened. “So <i>that’s</i> why you thought . . .” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">She nodded. “Yoren was taking me home to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“I . . . you’re highborn then, a . . . you’ll be a lady . . .” </text>
<text top="274" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya looked down at her ragged clothes and bare feet, all cracked and callused. She saw </text>
<text top="294" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the dirt under her nails, the scabs on her elbows, the scratches on her hands. <i>Septa Mordane </i></text>
<text top="313" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>wouldn’t even know me, I bet. Sansa might, but she’d pretend not to.</i> “My mother’s a lady, </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">and my sister, but I never was.” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes you were. You were a lord’s daughter and you lived in a castle, didn’t you? And </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you . . . gods be good, I never . . .”  All of a sudden Gendry seemed uncertain, almost afraid. </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“All that about cocks, I never should have said that. And I been pissing in front of you and </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">everything, I . . . I beg your pardon, m’lady.” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“<i>Stop that!</i>” Arya hissed. Was he mocking her? </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I know my courtesies, m’lady,” Gendry said, stubborn as ever. “Whenever highborn </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">girls came into the shop with their fathers, my master told me I was to bend the knee, and </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">speak only when they spoke to me, and call them <i>m’lady</i>.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you start calling me m’lady, even <i>Hot Pie</i> is going to notice. And you better keep on </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">pissing the same way too.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="172" height="15" font="1">“As m’lady commands.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya slammed his chest with both hands. He tripped over a stone and sat down with a </text>
<text top="620" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">thump. “What kind of lord’s daughter are you?” he said, laughing. </text>
<text top="645" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>This</i> kind.” She kicked him in the side, but it only made him laugh harder. “You laugh </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all you like. <i>I’m</i> going to see who’s in the village.” The sun had already fallen below the trees; </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dusk would be on them in no time at all. For once it was Gendry who had to hurry after. “You </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">smell that?” she asked. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="228" height="15" font="1">He sniffed the air. “Rotten fish?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="146" height="15" font="1">“You know it’s not.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We better be careful. I’ll go around west, see if there’s some road. There must be if you </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="468" height="15" font="1">saw a wagon. You take the shore. If you need help, bark like a dog.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That’s stupid. If I need help, I’ll shout <i>help</i>.” She darted away, bare feet silent in the </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grass. When she glanced back over her shoulder, he was watching her with that pained look </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on his face that meant he was thinking. <i>He’s probably thinking that he shouldn’t be letting </i></text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="491" height="15" font="5"><i>m’lady go stealing food.</i> Arya just knew he was going to be stupid now. </text>
<text top="907" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The smell grew stronger as she got closer to the village. It did not smell like rotten fish to </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="403" height="15" font="1">her. This stench was ranker, fouler. She wrinkled her nose. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Where the trees began to thin, she used the undergrowth, slipping from bush to bush </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">quiet as a shadow. Every few yards she stopped to listen. The third time, she heard horses, and </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a man’s voice as well. And the smell got worse. <i>Dead man’s stink, that’s what it is.</i> She had </text>

<text top="1035" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A dense thicket of brambles grew south of the village. By the time she reached it, the </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">long shadows of sunset had begun to fade, and the lantern bugs were coming out. She could </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see thatched roofs just beyond the hedge. She crept along until she found a gap and squirmed </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">through on her belly, keeping well hidden until she saw what made the smell. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beside the gently lapping waters of Gods Eye, a long gibbet of raw green wood had been </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thrown up, and things that had once been men dangled there, their feet in chains, while crows </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pecked at their flesh and flapped from corpse to corpse. For every crow there were a hundred </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">flies. When the wind blew off the lake, the nearest corpse twisted on its chain, ever so </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">slightly. The crows had eaten most of its face, and something else had been at it as well, </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">something much larger. Throat and chest had been torn apart, and glistening green entrails </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and ribbons of ragged flesh dangled from where the belly had been opened. One arm had been </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ripped right off the shoulder; Arya saw the bones a few feet away, gnawed and cracked, </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="149" height="15" font="1">picked clean of meat. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">She made herself look at the next man and the one beyond him and the one beyond <i>him</i>, </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">telling herself she was hard as a stone. Corpses all, so savaged and decayed that it took her a </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">moment to realize they had been stripped before they were hanged. They did not look like </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">naked people; they hardly looked like people at all. The crows had eaten their eyes, and </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sometimes their faces. Of the sixth in the long row, nothing remained but a single leg, still </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">tangled in its chains, swaying with each breeze. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Fear cuts deeper than swords.</i> Dead men could not hurt her, but whoever had killed them </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">could. Well beyond the gibbet, two men in mail hauberks stood leaning on their spears in </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">front of the long low building by the water, the one with the slate roof. A pair of tall poles had </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">been driven into the muddy ground in front of it, banners drooping from each staff. One </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">looked red and one paler, white or yellow maybe, but both were limp and with the dusk </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">settling, she could not even be certain that red one was Lannister crimson. <i>I don’t need to see </i></text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="5"><i>the lion, I can see all the dead people, who else would it be but Lannisters?</i> </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="165" height="15" font="1">Then there was a shout. </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The two spearmen turned at the cry, and a third man came into view, shoving a captive </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before him. It was growing too dark to make out faces, but the prisoner was wearing a shiny </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steel helm, and when Arya saw the horns she knew it was Gendry. <i>You stupid stupid stupid </i></text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="5"><i>STUPID!</i> she thought. If he’d been here she would have kicked him again. </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The guards were talking loudly, but she was too far away to make out the words, </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">especially with the crows gabbling and flapping closer to hand. One of the spearmen snatched </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the helm off Gendry’s head and asked him a question, but he must not have liked the answer, </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">because he smashed him across the face with the butt of his spear and knocked him down. </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The one who’d captured him gave him a kick, while the second spearman was trying on the </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">bull’s-head helm. Finally they pulled him to his feet and marched him off toward the </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">storehouse. When they opened the heavy wooden doors, a small boy darted out, but one of the </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">guards grabbed his arm and flung him back inside. Arya heard sobbing from inside the </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="538" height="15" font="1">building, and then a shriek so loud and full of pain that it made her bite her lip. </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The guards shoved Gendry inside with the boy and barred the doors behind them. Just </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">then, a breath of wind came sighing off the lake, and the banners stirred and lifted. The one on </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the tall staff bore the golden lion, as she’d feared. On the other, three sleek black shapes ran </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">across a field as yellow as butter. Dogs, she thought. Arya had seen those dogs before, but </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">where? </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">It didn’t matter. The only thing that mattered was that they had Gendry. Even if he <i>was</i> </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stubborn and stupid, she had to get him out. She wondered if they knew that the queen wanted </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="35" height="15" font="1">him. </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">One of the guards took off his helm and donned Gendry’s instead. It made her angry to </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see him wearing it, but she knew there was nothing she could do to stop him. She thought she </text>

<page number="162" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">heard more screams from inside the windowless storehouse, muffled by the masonry, but it </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">was hard to be certain. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She stayed long enough to see the guard changed, and much more besides. Men came </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and went. They led their horses down to the stream to drink. A hunting party returned from </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the wood, carrying a deer’s carcass slung from a pole. She watched them clean and gut it and </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">build a cookfire on the far side of the stream, and the smell of cooking meat mingled queerly </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with the stench of corruption. Her empty belly roiled and she thought she might retch. The </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">prospect of food brought other men out of the houses, near all of them wearing bits of mail or </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">boiled leather. When the deer was cooked, the choicest portions were carried to one of the </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">houses. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">She thought that the dark might let her crawl close and free Gendry, but the guards </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">kindled torches off the cookfire. A squire brought meat and bread to the two guarding the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">storehouse, and later two more men joined them and they all passed a skin of wine from hand </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to hand. When it was empty the others left, but the two guards remained, leaning on their </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">spears. </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya’s arms and legs were stiff when she finally wriggled out from under the briar into </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">the dark of the wood. It was a black night, with a thin sliver of moon appearing and </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">disappearing as the clouds blew past. <i>Silent as a shadow</i>, she told herself as she moved </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through the trees. In this darkness she dared not run, for fear of tripping on some unseen root </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">or losing her way. On her left Gods Eye lapped calmly against its shores. On her right a wind </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sighed through the branches, and leaves rustled and stirred. Far off, she heard the howling of </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">wolves. </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lommy and Hot Pie almost shit themselves when she stepped out of the trees behind </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them. “Quiet,” she told them, putting an arm around Weasel when the little girl came running </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="25" height="15" font="1">up. </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie stared at her with big eyes. “We thought you left us.” He had his shortsword in </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">hand, the one Yoren had taken off the gold cloak. “I was scared you was a wolf.” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">“Where’s the Bull?” asked Lommy. </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They caught him,” Arya whispered. “We have to get him out. Hot Pie, you got to help. </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="437" height="15" font="1">We’ll sneak up and kill the guards, and then I’ll open the door.” </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="371" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie and Lommy exchanged a look. “How many?” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="540" height="15" font="1">“I couldn’t count,” Arya admitted. “Twenty at least, but only two on the door.” </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="456" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie looked as if he were going to cry. “We can’t fight <i>twenty</i>.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="549" height="15" font="1">“You only need to fight <i>one</i>. I’ll do the other and we’ll get Gendry out and run.” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">“We should yield,” Lommy said. “Just go in and yield.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="226" height="15" font="1">Arya shook her head stubbornly. </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then just leave him, Arry,” Lommy pleaded. “They don’t know about the rest of us. If </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">we hide, they’ll go away, you know they will. It’s not our fault Gendry’s captured.” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You’re stupid, Lommy,” Arya said angrily. “You’ll <i>die</i> if we don’t get Gendry out. </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">Who’s going to carry you?” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="137" height="15" font="1">“You and Hot Pie.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“All the time, with no one else to help? We’ll never do it. Gendry was the strong one. </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Anyhow, I don’t care what you say, I’m going back for him.” She looked at Hot Pie. “Are you </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">coming?” </text>
<text top="1063" left="171" width="587" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie glanced at Lommy, at Arya, at Lommy again. “I’ll come,” he said reluctantly. </text>
</page>
<page number="163" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="235" height="15" font="1">“Lommy, you keep Weasel here.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="595" height="15" font="1">He grabbed the little girl by the hand and pulled her close. “What if the wolves come?” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="175" height="15" font="1">“Yield,” Arya suggested. </text>
<text top="180" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Finding their way back to the village seemed to take hours. Hot Pie kept stumbling in the </text>
<text top="199" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dark and losing his way, and Arya had to wait for him and double back. Finally she took him </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by the hand and led him along through the trees. “Just be quiet and follow.” When they could </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">make out the first faint glow of the village fires against the sky, she said, “There’s dead men </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hanging on the other side of the hedge, but they’re nothing to be scared of, just remember fear </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="532" height="15" font="1">cuts deeper than swords. We have to go real quiet and slow.” Hot Pie nodded. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She wriggled under the briar first and waited for him on the far side, crouched low. Hot </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Pie emerged pale and panting, face and arms bloody with long scratches. He started to say </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">something, but Arya put a finger to his lips. On hands and knees, they crawled along the </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">gibbet, beneath the swaying dead. Hot Pie never once looked up, nor made a sound. </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Until the crow landed on his back, and he gave a muffled gasp. “<i>Who’s there?</i>” a voice </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="225" height="15" font="1">boomed suddenly from the dark. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie leapt to his feet. “<i>I yield!</i>” He threw away his sword as dozens of crows rose </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shrieking and complaining to flap about the corpses. Arya grabbed his leg and tried to drag </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="1">him back down, but he wrenched loose and ran forward, waving his arms. “I yield, I yield.” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She bounced up and drew Needle, but by then men were all around her. Arya slashed at </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the nearest, but he blocked her with a steel-clad arm, and someone else slammed into her and </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">dragged her to the ground, and a third man wrenched the sword from her grasp. When she </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tried to bite, her teeth snapped shut on cold dirty chain-mail. “Oho, a fierce one,” the man </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="510" height="15" font="1">said, laughing. The blow from his iron-clad fist near knocked her head off. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They talked over her as she lay hurting, but Arya could not seem to understand the </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">words. Her ears rang. When she tried to crawl off, the earth moved beneath her. <i>They took </i></text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Needle.</i> The shame of that hurt worse than the pain, and the pain hurt a lot. Jon had given her </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">that sword. Syrio had taught her to use it. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Finally someone grabbed the front of her jerkin, yanked her to her knees. Hot Pie was </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">kneeling too, before the tallest man Arya had ever seen, a monster from one of Old Nan’s </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stories. She never saw where the giant had come from. Three black dogs raced across his </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">faded yellow surcoat, and his face looked as hard as if it had been cut from stone. Suddenly </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Arya knew where she had seen those dogs before. The night of the tourney at King’s Landing, </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">all the knights had hung their shields outside their pavilions. “That one belongs to the </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Hound’s brother,” Sansa had confided when they passed the black dogs on the yellow field. </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="570" height="15" font="1">“He’s even bigger than Hodor, you’ll see. They call him <i>the Mountain That Rides</i>.” </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya let her head droop, only half aware of what was going on around her. Hot Pie was </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">yielding some more. The Mountain said, “You’ll lead us to these others,” and walked off. </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Next she was stumbling past the dead men on their gibbet, while Hot Pie told their captors </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he’d bake them pies and tarts if they didn’t hurt him. Four men went with them. One carried a </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">torch, one a longsword; two had spears. </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They found Lommy where they’d left him, under the oak. “I yield,” he called out at once </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">when he saw them. He’d flung away his own spear and raised his hands, splotchy green with </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">old dye. “I yield. Please.” </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The man with the torch searched around under the trees. “Are you the last? Baker boy </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">said there was a girl.” </text>

<page number="164" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She ran off when she heard you coming,” Lommy said. “You made a lot of noise.” And </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="586" height="15" font="1">Arya thought, <i>Run, Weasel, run as far as you can, run and hide and never come back.</i> </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tell us where we can find that whoreson Dondarrion, and there’ll be a hot meal in it for </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="208" height="15" font="1">“Who?” said Lommy blankly. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I told you, this lot don’t know no more than those cunts in the village. Waste o’ bloody </text>

<text top="263" left="171" width="584" height="15" font="1">One of the spearmen drifted over to Lommy. “Something wrong with your leg, boy?” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="91" height="15" font="1">“It got hurt.” </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="284" height="15" font="1">“Can you walk?” He sounded concerned. </text>

<text top="522" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They had warned him to dress warmly. Tyrion Lannister took them at their word. He was </text>
<text top="542" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">garbed in heavy quilted breeches and a woolen doublet, and over it all he had thrown the </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shadowskin cloak he had acquired in the Mountains of the Moon. The cloak was absurdly </text>
<text top="581" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">long, made for a man twice his height. When he was not ahorse, the only way to wear the </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="637" height="15" font="1">thing was to wrap it around him several times, which made him look like a ball of striped fur. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Even so, he was glad he had listened. The chill in the long dank vault went bone-deep. </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Timett had chosen to retreat back up to the cellar after a brief taste of the cold below. They </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were somewhere under the hill of Rhaenys, behind the Guildhall of the Alchemists. The damp </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stone walls were splotchy with niter, and the only light came from the sealed iron-and-glass </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="394" height="15" font="1">oil lamp that Hallyne the Pyromancer carried so gingerly. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Gingerly indeed . . . and these would be the ginger jars.</i> Tyrion lifted one for inspection. </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">It was round and ruddy, a fat clay grapefruit. A little big for his hand, but it would fit </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">comfortably in the grip of a normal man, he knew. The pottery was thin, so fragile that even </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">he had been warned not to squeeze too tightly, lest he crush it in his fist. The clay felt </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">roughened, pebbled. Hallyne told him that was intentional. “A smooth pot is more apt to slip </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">from a man’s grasp.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The wildfire oozed slowly toward the lip of the jar when Tyrion tilted it to peer inside. </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">The color would be a murky green, he knew, but the poor light made that impossible to </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">confirm. “Thick,” he observed. </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That is from the cold, my lord,” said Hallyne, a pallid man with soft damp hands and an </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">obsequious manner. He was dressed in striped black-and-scarlet robes trimmed with sable, but </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the fur looked more than a little patchy and moth-eaten. “As it warms, the substance will flow </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">more easily, like lamp oil.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>The substance</i> was the pyromancers’ own term for wildfire. They called each other </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>wisdom</i> as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed. Once theirs had been </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">a powerful guild, but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel had supplanted the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">alchemists almost everywhere. Now only a few of the older order remained, and they no </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">longer even pretended to transmute metals . . . </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="487" height="15" font="1">. . . but they <i>could</i> make wildfire. “Water will not quench it, I am told.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That is so. Once it takes fire, the substance will burn fiercely until it is no more. More, it </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="491" height="15" font="1">will seep into cloth, wood, leather, even steel, so they take fire as well.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion remembered the red priest Thoros of Myr and his flaming sword. Even a thin </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">coating of wildfire could burn for an hour. Thoros always needed a new sword after a melee, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but Robert had been fond of the man and ever glad to provide one. “Why doesn’t it seep into </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Oh, but it does,” said Hallyne. “There is a vault below this one where we store the older </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pots. Those from King Aerys’s day. It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fruits. Very perilous fruits indeed, my lord Hand, and, hmmm, <i>riper</i> now than ever, if you </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">take my meaning. We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water, </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but even so . . . by rights they ought to have been destroyed, but so many of our masters were </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">murdered during the Sack of King’s Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the task. And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost. Only last year, two hundred jars </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor. No one could recall how </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">they came there, but I’m sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">himself with terror. I myself saw that they were safely moved. I had a cart filled with sand, </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">and sent our most able acolytes. We worked only by night, we—” </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“—did a splendid job, I have no doubt.” Tyrion placed the jar he’d been holding back </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">among its fellows. They covered the table, standing in orderly rows of four and marching </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">away into the subterranean dimness. And there were other tables beyond, many other tables. </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">“These, ah, fruits of the late King Aerys, can they still be used?” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Oh,  yes,  most  certainly . . . but  <i>carefully</i>, my lord, ever so carefully. As it ages, the </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">substance grows ever more, hmmmm, <i>fickle</i>, let us say. Any flame will set it afire. Any spark. </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Too much heat and jars will blaze up of their own accord. It is not wise to let them sit in </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sunlight, even for a short time. Once the fire begins within, the heat causes the substance to </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">expand violently, and the jars shortly fly to pieces. If other jars should happen to be stored in </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="335" height="15" font="1">the same vicinity, those go up as well, and so—” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="287" height="15" font="1">“How many jars do you have at present?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This morning the Wisdom Munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="581" height="15" font="1">and forty. That count includes four thousand jars from King Aerys’s day, to be sure.” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="154" height="15" font="1">“Our overripe fruits?” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hallyne bobbed his head. “Wisdom Malliard believes we shall be able to provide a full </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ten thousand jars, as was promised the queen. I concur.” The pyromancer looked indecently </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">pleased with that prospect. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Assuming our enemies give you the time.</i> The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">closely guarded secret, but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy, dangerous, and time-consuming </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">process. He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast, like that of the </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified. <i>Perhaps a smidge of both.</i> </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“I trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste, Wisdom. We do not </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire, nor even one . . . and we most certainly do not </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">want any mishaps.” </text>

<page number="166" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There will be no mishaps, my lord Hand. The substance is prepared by trained acolytes </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the instant it is ready. Above each work cell is a room filled entirely with sand. A protective </text>

<text top="207" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Not to mention the careless acolyte.” By <i>spell</i> Tyrion imagined Hallyne meant <i>clever </i></text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="584" height="15" font="1">“My brethren are never careless,” Hallyne insisted. “If I may be, hmmmm, <i>frank</i> . . .” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="70" height="15" font="1">“Oh, do.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The substance flows through my veins, and lives in the heart of every pyromancer. We </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">respect its power. But the common soldier, hmmmm, the crew of one of the queen’s spitfires, </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">say, in the unthinking frenzy of battle . . . any little mistake can bring catastrophe. That cannot </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">be said too often. My father often told King Aerys as much, as <i>his</i> father told old King </text>

<text top="424" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They must have listened,” Tyrion said. “If they had burned the city down, someone </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">would have told me. So your counsel is that we had best be careful?” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“Be <i>very</i> careful,” said Hallyne. “Be <i>very very</i> careful.” </text>

<text top="519" left="171" width="307" height="15" font="1">“We do, my lord, and thank you for asking.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">“You won’t mind if I take some, then. A few thousand.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="134" height="15" font="1">“A few thousand?” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Or however many your guild can spare, without interfering with production. It’s <i>empty</i> </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">pots I’m asking for, understand. Have them sent round to the captains on each of the city </text>

<text top="659" left="171" width="218" height="15" font="1">“I will, my lord, but why . . . ?” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion smiled up at him. “When you tell me to dress warmly, I dress warmly. When you </text>

<text top="748" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It would be my great, hmmm, pleasure, my lord.” Hallyne lifted the lamp and led the </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">way back to the stairs. “It was good of you to visit us. A great honor, hmmm. It has been too </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">long since the King’s Hand graced us with his presence. Not since Lord Rossart, and he was </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of our order. That was back in King Aerys’s day. King Aerys took a great interest in our </text>

<text top="851" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>King Aerys used you to roast the flesh off his enemies.</i> His brother Jaime had told him a </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">few stories of the Mad King and his pet pyromancers. “Joffrey will be interested as well, I </text>

<text top="960" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was growing warmer as they climbed. “His Grace has prohibited all feasting until such </text>

<text top="1024" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A most, hmmm, <i>loving</i> gesture, my lord. Perhaps instead some few of us might call </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I will take it up with my sister.” Tyrion had no objection to a few magic tricks, but </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Joff’s fondness for making men fight to the death was trial enough; he had no intention of </text>

<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When at last they reached the top of the steps, Tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and folded it over his arm. The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stone, but Hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the Gallery of the </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Iron Torches, a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">columns twenty feet tall. Ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance. Tyrion would have been more impressed </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">if he hadn’t known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">visit, and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him. Wildfire was too </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">costly to squander. </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They emerged atop the broad curving steps that fronted on the Street of the Sisters, near </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the foot of Visenya’s Hill. He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men. Given his purpose today, it had seemed a </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">singularly appropriate choice for his guard. Besides, their scars struck terror in the hearts of </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the city rabble. That was all to the good these days. Only three nights past, another mob had </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">gathered at the gates of the Red Keep, chanting for food. Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">against them, slaying four, and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead. </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="5"><i>Winning us still more friends.</i> </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion was surprised to see Bronn standing beside the litter as well. “What are you doing </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">here?” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Delivering your messages,” Bronn said. “Ironhand wants you urgently at the Gate of the </text>

<text top="644" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Summoned?</i>” Tyrion knew of only one person who would presume to use that word. </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">“And what does Cersei want of me?” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bronn shrugged. “The queen commands you to return to the castle at once and attend her </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in her chambers. That stripling cousin of yours delivered the message. Four hairs on his lip </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">and he thinks he’s a man.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Four hairs and a knighthood. He’s <i>Ser</i> Lancel now, never forget.” Tyrion knew that Ser </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jacelyn would not send for him unless the matter was of import. “I’d best see what Bywater </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">wants. Inform my sister that I will attend her on my return.” </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="257" height="15" font="1">“She won’t like that,” Bronn warned. </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Good. The longer Cersei waits, the angrier she’ll become, and anger makes her stupid. I </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">much prefer angry and stupid to composed and cunning.” Tyrion tossed his folded cloak into </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">his litter, and Timett helped him up after it. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The market square inside the Gate of the Gods, which in normal times would have been </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">thronged with farmers selling vegetables, was near-deserted when Tyrion crossed it. Ser </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jacelyn met him at the gate, and raised his iron hand in brusque salute. “My lord. Your cousin </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="636" height="15" font="1">Cleos Frey is here, come from Riverrun under a peace banner with a letter from Robb Stark.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“Peace terms?” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="95" height="15" font="1">“So he says.” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“Sweet cousin. Show me to him.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The gold cloaks had confined Ser Cleos to a windowless guardroom in the gatehouse. He </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="1">rose when they entered. “Tyrion, you are a most welcome sight.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“That’s not something I hear often, cousin.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“Has Cersei come with you?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My sister is otherwise occupied. Is this Stark’s letter?” He plucked it off the table. “Ser </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">Jacelyn, you may leave us.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bywater bowed and departed. “I was asked to bring the offer to the Queen Regent,” Ser </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">Cleos said as the door shut. </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I shall.” Tyrion glanced over the map that Robb Stark had sent with his letter. “All in </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">good time, cousin. Sit. Rest. You look gaunt and haggard.” He looked worse than that, in </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">truth. </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” Ser Cleos lowered himself onto a bench. “It is bad in the riverlands, Tyrion. </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Around the Gods Eye and along the kingsroad especially. The river lords are burning their </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">own crops to try and starve us, and your father’s foragers are torching every village they take </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">and putting the smallfolk to the sword.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That was the way of war. The smallfolk were slaughtered, while the highborn were held </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">for ransom. <i>Remind me to thank the gods that I was born a Lannister.</i> </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos ran a hand through his thin brown hair. “Even with a peace banner, we were </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">attacked twice. Wolves in mail, hungry to savage anyone weaker than themselves. The gods </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">alone know what side they started on, but they’re on their own side now. Lost three men, and </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="179" height="15" font="1">twice as many wounded.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What news of our foe?” Tyrion turned his attention back to Stark’s terms. <i>The boy does </i></text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>not want too much. Only half the realm, the release of our captives, hostages, his father’s </i></text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="5"><i>sword . . . oh, yes, and his sisters.</i> </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The boy sits idle at Riverrun,” Ser Cleos said. “I think he fears to face your father in the </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">field. His strength grows less each day. The river lords have departed, each to defend his own </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">lands.” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="5"><i>Is this what Father intended?</i> Tyrion rolled up Stark’s map. “These terms will never do.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Will you at least consent to trade the Stark girls for Tion and Willem?” Ser Cleos asked </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">plaintively. </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tion Frey was his younger brother, Tyrion recalled. “No,” he said gently, “but we’ll </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">propose our own exchange of captives. Let me consult with Cersei and the council. We shall </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="298" height="15" font="1">send you back to Riverrun with our terms.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Clearly, the prospect did not cheer him. “My lord, I do not believe Robb Stark will yield </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">easily. It is Lady Catelyn who wants this peace, not the boy.” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lady Catelyn wants her daughters.” Tyrion pushed himself down from the bench, letter </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and map in hand. “Ser Jacelyn will see that you have food and fire. You look in dire need of </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="383" height="15" font="1">sleep, cousin. I will send for you when we know more.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He found Ser Jacelyn on the ramparts, watching several hundred new recruits drilling in </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the field below. With so many seeking refuge in King’s Landing, there was no lack of men </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">willing to join the City Watch for a full belly and a bed of straw in the barracks, but Tyrion </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had no illusions about how well these ragged defenders of theirs would fight if it came to </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">battle. </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You did well to send for me,” Tyrion said. “I shall leave Ser Cleos in your hands. He is </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">to have every hospitality.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“And his escort?” the commander wanted to know. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Give them food and clean garb, and find a maester to see to their hurts. They are not to </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">set foot inside the city, is that understood?” It would never do to have the truth of conditions </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="197" height="15" font="1">“Well understood, my lord.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh, and one more thing. The alchemists will be sending a large supply of clay pots to </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">each of the city gates. You’re to use them to train the men who will work your spitfires. Fill </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the pots with green paint and have them drill at loading and firing. Any man who spatters </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">should be replaced. When they have mastered the paint pots, substitute lamp oil and have </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">them work at lighting the jars and firing them while aflame. Once they learn to do that </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">without burning themselves, they may be ready for wildfire.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Jacelyn scratched at his cheek with his iron hand. “Wise measures. Though I have no </text>

<text top="386" left="171" width="234" height="15" font="1">“Nor I, but I use what I’m given.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Once back inside his litter, Tyrion Lannister drew the curtains and plumped a cushion </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">under his elbow. Cersei would be displeased to learn that he had intercepted Stark’s letter, but </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">his father had sent him here to rule, not to please Cersei. </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It seemed to him that Robb Stark had given them a golden chance. Let the boy wait at </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Riverrun dreaming of an easy peace. Tyrion would reply with terms of his own, giving the </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">King in the North just enough of what he wanted to keep him hopeful. Let Ser Cleos wear out </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his bony Frey rump riding to and fro with offers and counters. All the while, their cousin Ser </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stafford would be training and arming the new host he’d raised at Casterly Rock. Once he </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">was ready, he and Lord Tywin could smash the Tullys and Starks between them. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Now if only Robert’s brothers would be so accommodating.</i> Glacial as his progress was, </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">still Renly Baratheon crept north and east with his huge southron host, and scarcely a night </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">passed that Tyrion did not dread being awakened with the news that Lord Stannis was sailing </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his fleet up the Blackwater Rush. <i>Well, it would seem I have a goodly stock of wildfire, but </i></text>

<text top="700" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The sound of some hubbub in the street intruded on his worries. Tyrion peered out </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">cautiously between the curtains. They were passing through Cobbler’s Square, where a </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sizable crowd had gathered beneath the leather awnings to listen to the rantings of a prophet. </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">A robe of undyed wool belted with a hempen rope marked him for one of the begging </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">brothers. </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“<i>Corruption!</i>” the man cried shrilly. “There is the warning! Behold the Father’s </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scourge!” He pointed at the fuzzy red wound in the sky. From this vantage, the distant castle </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">on Aegon’s High Hill was directly behind him, with the comet hanging forebodingly over its </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">towers. <i>A clever choice of stage</i>, Tyrion reflected. “We have become swollen, bloated, foul. </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give </text>

<text top="939" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve! Pride comes before prayer, </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">maggots rule our castles, and gold is all . . . but <i>no more!</i> The Rotten Summer is at an end, </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and the Whoremonger King is brought low! When the boar did open him, a great stench rose </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!” He jabbed his </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bony finger back at comet and castle. “There comes the Harbinger! Cleanse yourselves, the </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">took solace from that. He gave the command to continue, and the litter rocked like a ship on a </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rough sea as the Burned Men cleared a path. <i>Twisted little monkey demon indeed.</i> The wretch </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">did have a point about the High Septon, to be sure. What was it that Moon Boy had said of </text>

<text top="201" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>each of them whenever he sits to table.</i> The memory of the fool’s jape made Tyrion smile. </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He was pleased to reach the Red Keep without further incident. As he climbed the steps </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to his chambers, Tyrion felt a deal more hopeful than he had at dawn. <i>Time, that’s all I truly </i></text>

<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei turned away from the window, her skirts swirling around her slender hips. “How </text>

<text top="335" left="171" width="239" height="15" font="1">“Who admitted you to my tower?” </text>

<text top="386" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“So they tell me.” Tyrion was not amused. Crawn would be even less so; his Moon </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">Brothers had the guard today. “I was about to come to you, as it happens.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="93" height="15" font="1">“Were you?” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">He swung the door shut behind him. “You doubt me?” </text>

<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m hurt.” Tyrion waddled to the sideboard for a cup of wine. He knew no surer way to </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">work up a thirst than talking with Cersei. “If I’ve given you offense, I would know how.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“What a disgusting little worm you are. Myrcella is my only daughter. Did you truly </text>

<text top="595" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>Myrcella</i>, he thought. <i>Well, that egg has hatched. Let’s see what color the chick is.</i> </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Hardly a bag of oats. Myrcella is a princess. Some would say this is what she was born for. </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">Or did you plan to marry her to Tommen?” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her hand lashed out, knocking the wine cup from his hand to spill on the floor. “Brother </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Martell is too honorable to murder a nine-year-old girl, particularly one as sweet and </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">innocent as Myrcella. So long as he holds her he can be reasonably certain that we’ll keep </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">faith on our side, and the terms are too rich to refuse. Myrcella is the least part of it. I’ve also </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="536" height="15" font="1">offered him his sister’s killer, a council seat, some castles on the Marches . . .” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Too much.” Cersei paced away from him, restless as a lioness, skirts swirling. “You’ve </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">offered too much, and without my authority or consent.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This is the Prince of Dorne we are speaking of. If I’d offered less, he’d likely spit in my </text>

<text top="321" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“<i>Too much!</i>” Cersei insisted, whirling back. </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What would <i>you</i> have offered him, that hole between your legs?” Tyrion said, his own </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">anger flaring. </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">This time he saw the slap coming. His head snapped around with a <i>crack</i>. “Sweet sweet </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">sister,” he said, “I promise you, that was the last time you will ever strike me.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His sister laughed. “Don’t threaten me, little man. Do you think Father’s letter keeps you </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">safe? A piece of paper. Eddard Stark had a piece of paper too, for all the good it did him.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Eddard Stark did not have the City Watch</i>, Tyrion thought, <i>nor my clansmen, nor the </i></text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>sellswords that Bronn has hired. I do.</i> Or so he hoped. Trusting in Varys, in Ser Jacelyn </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="481" height="15" font="1">Bywater, in Bronn. Lord Stark had probably had his delusions as well. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yet he said nothing. A wise man did not pour wildfire on a brazier. Instead he poured a </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fresh cup of wine. “How safe do you think Myrcella will be if King’s Landing falls? Renly </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">and Stannis will mount her head beside yours.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="173" height="15" font="1">And Cersei began to cry. </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion Lannister could not have been more astonished if Aegon the Conqueror himself </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">had burst into the room, riding on a dragon and juggling lemon pies. He had not seen his sister </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weep since they were children together at Casterly Rock. Awkwardly, he took a step toward </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her. When your sister cries, you were supposed to comfort her . . . but this was <i>Cersei!</i> He </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">reached a tentative hand for her shoulder. </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Don’t  <i>touch</i> me,” she said, wrenching away. It should not have hurt, yet it did, more </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">than any slap. Red-faced, as angry as she was grief-stricken, Cersei struggled for breath. </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">“Don’t look at me, not . . . not like this . . . not <i>you</i>.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Politely, Tyrion turned his back. “I did not mean to frighten you. I promise you, nothing </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">will happen to Myrcella.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Liar,” she said behind him. “I’m not a child, to be soothed with empty promises. You </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">told me you would free Jaime too. Well, where is he?” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="581" height="15" font="1">“In Riverrun, I should imagine. Safe and under guard, until I find a way to free him.” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei sniffed. “I should have been born a man. I would have no need of any of you then. </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">None of this would have been allowed to happen. How could Jaime let himself be captured by </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that <i>boy?</i> And Father, I trusted in him, fool that I am, but where is he now that he’s wanted? </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">What is he <i>doing?</i>” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="106" height="15" font="1">“Making war.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“From behind the walls of Harrenhal?” she said scornfully. “A curious way of fighting. It </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="218" height="15" font="1">looks suspiciously like hiding.” </text>
<text top="1068" left="171" width="100" height="15" font="1">“Look again.” </text>

<page number="172" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What else would you call it? Father sits in one castle, and Robb Stark sits in another, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">and no one does anything.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There is sitting and there is sitting,” Tyrion suggested. “Each one waits for the other to </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">move, but the lion is still, poised, his tail twitching, while the fawn is frozen by fear, bowels </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="612" height="15" font="1">turned to jelly. No matter which way he bounds, the lion will have him, and he knows it.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="341" height="15" font="1">“And you’re <i>quite</i> certain that Father is the lion?” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="283" height="15" font="1">Tyrion grinned. “It’s on all our banners.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She ignored the jest. “If it was Father who’d been taken captive, Jaime would not be </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">sitting by idly, I promise you.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Jaime would be battering his host to bloody bits against the walls of Riverrun, and the </i></text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>Others take their chances. He never did have any patience, no more than you, sweet sister.</i> </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Not all of us can be as bold as Jaime, but there are other ways to win wars. Harrenhal is </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">strong and well situated.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“And King’s Landing is <i>not</i>, as we both know perfectly well. While Father plays lion and </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fawn with the Stark boy, Renly marches up the roseroad. He could be at our gates any day </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">now!” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The city will not fall in a day. From Harrenhal it is a straight, swift march down the </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kingsroad. Renly will scarce have unlimbered his siege engines before Father takes him in the </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="580" height="15" font="1">rear. His host will be the hammer, the city walls the anvil. It makes a lovely picture.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s green eyes bored into him, wary, yet hungry for the reassurance he was feeding </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">her. “And if Robb Stark marches?” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Harrenhal is close enough to the fords of the Trident so that Roose Bolton cannot bring </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the northern foot across to join with the Young Wolf’s horse. Stark cannot march on King’s </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Landing without taking Harrenhal first, and even with Bolton he is not strong enough to do </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">that.” Tyrion tried his most winning smile. “Meanwhile Father lives off the fat of the </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">riverlands, while our uncle Stafford gathers fresh levies at the Rock.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei regarded him suspiciously. “How could you know all this? Did Father tell you his </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">intentions when he sent you here?” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="177" height="15" font="1">“No. I glanced at a map.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her look turned to disdain. “You’ve conjured up every word of this in that grotesque </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="236" height="15" font="1">head of yours, haven’t you, Imp?” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion <i>tsk</i>ed. “Sweet sister, I ask you, if we weren’t winning, would the Starks have sued </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for peace?” He drew out the letter that Ser Cleos Frey had brought. “The Young Wolf has sent </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">us  terms,  you  see.  Unacceptable  terms,  to  be sure, but still, a beginning. Would you care to </text>

<text top="865" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” That fast, she was all queen again. “How do you come to have them? They should </text>

<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What else is a Hand for, if not to hand you things?” Tyrion handed her the letter. His </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cheek still throbbed where Cersei’s hand had left its mark. <i>Let her flay half my face, it will be </i></text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of House Stark, while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet, his sleeves and collar </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">trimmed with vair. Over his heart was his wolf’s-head brooch of silver and polished jet. He </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">would sooner have had Summer than a silver wolf on his breast, but Ser Rodrik had been </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">unyielding. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The low stone steps balked Dancer only for a moment. When Bran urged her on, she took </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">them easily. Beyond the wide oak-and-iron doors, eight long rows of trestle tables filled </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Winterfell’s Great Hall, four on each side of the center aisle. Men crowded shoulder to </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">shoulder on the benches. “Stark!” they called as Bran trotted past, rising to their feet. </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">“Winterfell! <i>Winterfell!</i>” </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He was old enough to know that it was not truly him they shouted for—it was the harvest </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they cheered, it was Robb and his victories, it was his lord father and his grandfather and all </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Starks going back eight thousand years. Still, it made him swell with pride. For so long as </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">it took him to ride the length of that hall he forgot that he was broken. Yet when he reached </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the dais, with every eye upon him, Osha and Hodor undid his straps and buckles, lifted him </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">off Dancer’s back, and carried him to the high seat of his fathers. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik was seated to Bran’s left, his daughter Beth beside him. Rickon was to his </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">right, his mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that it brushed his ermine mantle. He had </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">refused to let anyone cut it since their mother had gone. The last girl to try had been bitten for </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">her efforts. “I wanted to ride too,” he said as Hodor led Dancer away. “I ride better than you.” </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You don’t, so hush up,” he told his brother. Ser Rodrik bellowed for quiet. Bran raised </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his voice. He bid them welcome in the name of his brother, the King in the North, and asked </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them to thank the gods old and new for Robb’s victories and the bounty of the harvest. “May </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">there be a hundred more,” he finished, raising his father’s silver goblet. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>A hundred more!</i>” Pewter tankards, clay cups, and iron-banded drinking horns clashed </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">together. Bran’s wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves, but </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stronger than he was used to. He could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through his chest </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="534" height="15" font="1">as he swallowed. By the time he set down the goblet, his head was swimming. </text>
<text top="683" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You did well, Bran,” Ser Rodrik told him. “Lord Eddard would have been most proud.” </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Down the table, Maester Luwin nodded his agreement as the servers began to carry in the </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="40" height="15" font="1">food. </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Such food Bran had never seen; course after course after course, so much that he could </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not manage more than a bite or two of each dish. There were great joints of aurochs roasted </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with leeks, venison pies chunky with carrots, bacon, and mushrooms, mutton chops sauced in </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">honey and cloves, savory duck, peppered boar, goose, skewers of pigeon and capon, beef-and-</text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">barley stew, cold fruit soup. Lord Wyman had brought twenty casks of fish from White </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Harbor packed in salt and seaweed; whitefish and winkles, crabs and mussels, clams, herring, </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cod, salmon, lobster and lampreys. There was black bread and honeycakes and oaten biscuits; </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">there were turnips and pease and beets, beans and squash and huge red onions; there were </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">baked apples and berry tarts and pears poached in strongwine. Wheels of white cheese were </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">set at every table, above and below the salt, and flagons of hot spice wine and chilled autumn </text>

<text top="967" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lord Wyman’s musicians played bravely and well, but harp and fiddle and horn were </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter, the clash of cup and plate, and the snarling </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of hounds fighting for table scraps. The singer sang good songs, “Iron Lances” and “The </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Burning of the Ships” and “The Bear and the Maiden Fair,” but only Hodor seemed to be </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The noise swelled to a steady rumbling roar, a great heady stew of sound. Ser Rodrik </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">talked with Maester Luwin above Beth’s curly head, while Rickon screamed happily at the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Walders. Bran had not wanted the Freys at the high table, but the maester reminded him that </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they would soon be kin. Robb was to marry one of their aunts, and Arya one of their uncles. </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“She never will,” Bran said, “not Arya,” but Maester Luwin was unyielding, so there they </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">were beside Rickon. </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The serving men brought every dish to Bran first, that he might take the lord’s portion if </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he chose. By the time they reached the ducks, he could eat no more. After that he nodded </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">approval at each course in turn, and waved it away. If the dish smelled especially choice, he </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would send it to one of the lords on the dais, a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Luwin told him he must make. He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood, the </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boar to the boisterous Umbers, a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn, and a huge lobster </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">to Joseth the master of horse, who was neither lord nor guest, but had seen to Dancer’s </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">training and made it possible for Bran to ride. He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">for no reason but he loved them. Ser Rodrik reminded him to send something to his foster </text>

<text top="427" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">On the benches below, Winterfell men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town, </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">friends from the nearer holdfasts, and the escorts of their lordly guests. Some faces Bran had </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">never seen before, others he knew as well as his own, yet they all seemed equally foreign to </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. He watched them as from a distance, as if he still sat in the window of his bedchamber </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">looking down on the yard below, seeing everything yet a part of nothing. </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Osha moved among the tables, pouring ale. One of Leobald Tallhart’s men slid a hand up </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">under her skirts and she broke the flagon over his head, to roars of laughter. Yet Mikken had </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his hand down some woman’s bodice, and she seemed not to mind. Bran watched Farlen </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">make his red bitch beg for bones and smiled at Old Nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrinkled fingers. On the dais, Lord Wyman attacked a steaming plate of lampreys as if they </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were an enemy host. He was so fat that Ser Rodrik had commanded that a special wide chair </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">be built for him to sit in, but he laughed loud and often, and Bran thought he liked him. Poor </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">wan Lady Hornwood sat beside him, her face a stony mask as she picked listlessly at her food. </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">At the opposite end of the high table, Hother and Mors were playing a drinking game, </text>
<text top="705" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">slamming their horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust. </text>
<text top="730" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>It is too hot here, and too noisy, and they are all getting drunk.</i> Bran itched under his </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grey-and-white woolens, and suddenly he wished he were anywhere but here. <i>It is cool in the </i></text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>godswood now. Steam is rising off the hot pools, and the red leaves of the weirwood are </i></text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>rustling. The smells are richer than here, and before long the moon will rise and my brother </i></text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="97" height="15" font="5"><i>will sing to it.</i> </text>
<text top="833" left="171" width="297" height="15" font="1">“Bran?” Ser Rodrik said. “You do not eat.” </text>
<text top="858" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The waking dream had been so vivid, for a moment Bran had not known where he was. </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="412" height="15" font="1">“I’ll have more later,” he said. “My belly’s full to bursting.” </text>
<text top="903" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The old knight’s white mustache was pink with wine. “You have done well, Bran. Here, </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">and at the audiences. You will be an especial fine lord one day, I think.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I want to be a knight.</i> Bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from his father’s </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">goblet, grateful for something to clutch. The lifelike head of a snarling direwolf was raised on </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the side of the cup. He felt the silver muzzle pressing against his palm, and remembered the </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="401" height="15" font="1">last time he had seen his lord father drink from this goblet. </text>
<text top="1031" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It had been the night of the welcoming feast, when King Robert had brought his court to </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Winterfell. Summer still reigned then. His parents had shared the dais with Robert and his </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">queen, with her brothers beside her. Uncle Benjen had been there too, all in black. Bran and </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">his brothers and sisters sat with the king’s children, Joffrey and Tommen and Princess </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Myrcella, who’d spent the whole meal gazing at Robb with adoring eyes. Arya made faces </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">across the table when no one was looking; Sansa listened raptly while the king’s high harper </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sang songs of chivalry, and Rickon kept asking why Jon wasn’t with them. “Because he’s a </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">bastard,” Bran finally had to whisper to him. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>And now they are all gone.</i> It was as if some cruel god had reached down with a great </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand and swept them all away, the girls to captivity, Jon to the Wall, Robb and Mother to war, </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">King Robert and Father to their graves, and perhaps Uncle Benjen as well . . . </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Even down on the benches, there were new men at the tables. Jory was dead, and Fat </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Tom, and Porther, Alyn, Desmond, Hullen who had been master of horse, Harwin his </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">son . . . all those who had gone south with his father, even Septa Mordane and Vayon Poole. </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The rest had ridden to war with Robb, and might soon be dead as well for all Bran knew. He </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">liked Hayhead and Poxy Tym and Skittrick and the other new men well enough, but he </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">missed his old friends. </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He looked up and down the benches at all the faces happy and sad, and wondered who </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would be missing next year and the year after. He might have cried then, but he couldn’t. He </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="626" height="15" font="1">was the Stark in Winterfell, his father’s son and his brother’s heir, and almost a man grown. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">At the foot of the hall, the doors opened and a gust of cold air made the torches flame </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brighter for an instant. Alebelly led two new guests into the feast. “The Lady Meera of House </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">Reed,” the rotund guardsman bellowed over the clamor. “With her brother, Jojen, of </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">Greywater Watch.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Men looked up from their cups and trenchers to eye the newcomers. Bran heard Little </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Walder mutter, “Frogeaters,” to Big Walder beside him. Ser Rodrik climbed to his feet. “Be </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">welcome, friends, and share this harvest with us.” Serving men hurried to lengthen the table </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">on the dais, fetching trestles and chairs. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="218" height="15" font="1">“Who are <i>they?</i>” Rickon asked. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Mudmen,” answered Little Walder disdainfully. “They’re thieves and cravens, and they </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="249" height="15" font="1">have green teeth from eating frogs.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin crouched beside Bran’s seat to whisper counsel in his ear. “You must </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">greet these ones warmly. I had not thought to see them here, but . . . you know who they are?” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">Bran nodded. “Crannogmen. From the Neck.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Howland Reed was a great friend to your father,” Ser Rodrik told him. “These two are </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="139" height="15" font="1">his, it would seem.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As the newcomers walked the length of the hall, Bran saw that one was indeed a girl, </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">though he would never have known it by her dress. She wore lambskin breeches soft with </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">long use, and a sleeveless jerkin armored in bronze scales. Though near Robb’s age, she was </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slim as a boy, with long brown hair knotted behind her head and only the barest suggestion of </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">breasts. A woven net hung from one slim hip, a long bronze knife from the other; under her </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">arm she carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust; a frog spear and round leathern shield </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">were strapped to her back. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her brother was several years younger and bore no weapons. All his garb was green, </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">even to the leather of his boots, and when he came closer Bran saw that his eyes were the </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">color of moss, though his teeth looked as white as anyone else’s. Both Reeds were slight of </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">build, slender as swords and scarcely taller than Bran himself. They went to one knee before </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="61" height="15" font="1">the dais. </text>
</page>
<page number="176" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My lords of Stark,” the girl said. “The years have passed in their hundreds and their </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thousands since my folk first swore their fealty to the King in the North. My lord father has </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">sent us here to say the words again, for all our people.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>She is looking at me</i>, Bran realized. He had to make some answer. “My brother Robb is </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">fighting in the south,” he said, “but you can say your words to me, if you like.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“To Winterfell we pledge the faith of Greywater,” they said together. “Hearth and heart </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and harvest we yield up to you, my lord. Our swords and spears and arrows are yours to </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">command. Grant mercy to our weak, help to our helpless, and justice to all, and we shall never </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">fail you.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“I swear it by earth and water,” said the boy in green. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“I swear it by bronze and iron,” his sister said. </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="1">“We swear it by ice and fire,” they finished together. </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran groped for words. Was he supposed to swear something back to them? Their oath </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was not one he had been taught. “May your winters be short and your summers bountiful,” he </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="481" height="15" font="1">said. That was usually a good thing to say. “Rise. I’m Brandon Stark.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The girl, Meera, got to her feet and helped her brother up. The boy stared at Bran all the </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="426" height="15" font="1">while. “We bring you gifts of fish and frog and fowl,” he said. </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I thank you.” Bran wondered if he would have to eat a frog to be polite. “I offer you the </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">meat and mead of Winterfell.” He tried to recall all he had been taught of the crannogmen, </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left their wetlands. They were a poor </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">folk, fishers and frog-hunters who lived in houses of thatch and woven reeds on floating </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">islands hidden in the deeps of the swamp. It was said that they were a cowardly people who </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face them in open </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">battle. And yet Howland Reed had been one of Father’s staunchest companions during the </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">war for King Robert’s crown, before Bran was born. </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The boy, Jojen, looked about the hall curiously as he took his seat. “Where are the </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">direwolves?” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“In the godswood,” Rickon answered. “Shaggy was bad.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="346" height="15" font="1">“My brother would like to see them,” the girl said. </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Little Walder spoke up loudly. “He’d best watch they don’t see him, or they’ll take a bite </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">out of him.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They won’t bite if I’m there.” Bran was pleased that they wanted to see the wolves. </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">“Summer won’t anyway, and he’ll keep Shaggydog away.” He was curious about these </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mudmen. He could not recall ever seeing one before. His father had sent letters to the Lord of </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Greywater over the years, but none of the crannogmen had ever called at Winterfell. He </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">would have liked to talk to them more, but the Great Hall was so noisy that it was hard to hear </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="254" height="15" font="1">anyone who wasn’t right beside you. </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik was right beside Bran. “Do they truly eat frogs?” he asked the old knight. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="561" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” Ser Rodrik said. “Frogs and fish and lizard-lions, and all manner of birds.” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Maybe they don’t have sheep and cattle</i>, Bran thought. He commanded the serving men </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">to bring them mutton chops and a slice off the aurochs and fill their trenchers with beef-and-</text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">barley stew. They seemed to like that well enough. The girl caught him staring at her and </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">smiled. Bran blushed and looked away. </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Much later, after all the sweets had been served and washed down with gallons of </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">summerwine, the food was cleared and the tables shoved back against the walls to make room </text>
</page>
<page number="177" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for the dancing. The music grew wilder, the drummers joined in, and Hother Umber brought </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forth a huge curved warhorn banded in silver. When the singer reached the part in “The Night </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">That Ended” where the Night’s Watch rode forth to meet the Others in the Battle for the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">Dawn, he blew a blast that set all the dogs to barking. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Two Glover men began a spinning skirl on bladder and woodharp. Mors Umber was the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">first on his feet. He seized a passing serving girl by the arm, knocking the flagon of wine out </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of her hands to shatter on the floor. Amidst the rushes and bones and bits of bread that littered </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the stone, he whirled her and spun her and tossed her in the air. The girl squealed with </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">laughter and turned red as her skirts swirled and lifted. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Others soon joined in. Hodor began to dance all by himself, while Lord Wyman asked </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">little Beth Cassel to partner him. For all his size, he moved gracefully. When he tired, Cley </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Cerwyn danced with the child in his stead. Ser Rodrik approached Lady Hornwood, but she </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">made her excuses and took her leave. Bran watched long enough to be polite, and then had </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Hodor summoned. He was hot and tired, flushed from the wine, and the dancing made him </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="416" height="15" font="1">sad. It was something else he could never do. “I want to go.” </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” Hodor shouted back, kneeling. Maester Luwin and Hayhead lifted him into his </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">basket. The folk of Winterfell had seen this sight half a hundred times, but doubtless it looked </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="586" height="15" font="1">queer to the guests, some of whom were more curious than polite. Bran felt the stares. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They went out the rear rather than walk the length of the hall, Bran ducking his head as </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they passed through the lord’s door. In the dim-lit gallery outside the Great Hall, they came </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">upon Joseth the master of horse engaged in a different sort of riding. He had some woman </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bran did not know shoved up against the wall, her skirts around her waist. She was giggling </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">until Hodor stopped to watch. Then she screamed. “Leave them be, Hodor,” Bran had to tell </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">him. “Take me to my bedchamber.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hodor carried him up the winding steps to his tower and knelt beside one of the iron bars </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that Mikken had driven into the wall. Bran used the bars to move himself to the bed, and </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Hodor pulled off his boots and breeches. “You can go back to the feast now, but don’t go </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">bothering Joseth and that woman,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="683" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” Hodor replied, bobbing his head. </text>
<text top="708" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When he blew out his bedside candle, darkness covered him like a soft, familiar blanket. </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">The faint sound of music drifted through his shuttered window. </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Something his father had told him once when he was little came back to him suddenly. </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">He had asked Lord Eddard if the Kingsguard were truly the finest knights in the Seven </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Kingdoms. “No longer,” he answered, “but once they were a marvel, a shining lesson to the </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">world.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">“Was there one who was best of all?” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he would have killed me but for Howland Reed.” Father had gotten sad then, and he would </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">say no more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant. </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He went to sleep with his head full of knights in gleaming armor, fighting with swords </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that shone like starfire, but when the dream came he was in the godswood again. The smells </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from the kitchen and the Great Hall were so strong that it was almost as if he had never left </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the feast. He prowled beneath the trees, his brother close behind him. This night was wildly </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">alive, full of the howling of the man-pack at their play. The sounds made him restless. He </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="265" height="15" font="1">wanted to run, to hunt, he wanted to— </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The rattle of iron made his ears prick up. His brother heard it too. They raced through the </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one, he caught the scent of a stranger, the man-smell well mixed with leather and earth and </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The intruders had pushed a few yards into the wood when he came upon them; a female </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and a young male, with no taint of fear to them, even when he showed them the white of his </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They will be bigger still before they are grown,” the young male said, watching them </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with eyes large, green, and unafraid. “The black one is full of fear and rage, but the grey is </text>

<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No,” she said, moving a hand to the hilt of the long brown knife she wore. “Go careful, </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He won’t hurt me. This is not the day I die.” The male walked toward them, unafraid, </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and reached out for his muzzle, a touch as light as a summer breeze. Yet at the brush of those </text>

<text top="564" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">As she slept amidst the rolling grasslands, Catelyn dreamt that Bran was whole again, </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that Arya and Sansa held hands, that Rickon was still a babe at her breast. Robb, crownless, </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">played with a wooden sword, and when all were safe asleep, she found Ned in her bed, </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">smiling. </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sweet it was, sweet and gone too soon. Dawn came cruel, a dagger of light. She woke </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">aching and alone and weary; weary of riding, weary of hurting, weary of duty. <i>I want to weep</i>, </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she thought. <i>I want to be comforted. I’m so tired of being strong. I want to be foolish and </i></text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="5"><i>frightened for once. Just for a small while, that’s all . . . a day . . . an hour . . .</i> </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Outside her tent, men were stirring. She heard the whicker of horses, Shadd complaining </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of stiffness in his back, Ser Wendel calling for his bow. Catelyn wished they would all go </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">away. They were good men, loyal, yet she was tired of them all. It was her children she </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">yearned after. One day, she promised herself as she lay abed, one day she would allow herself </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="152" height="15" font="1">to be less than strong. </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="249" height="15" font="1">But not today. It could not be today. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her fingers seemed more clumsy than usual as she fumbled on her clothes. She supposed </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she ought to be grateful that she had any use of her hands at all. The dagger had been Valyrian </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">steel, and Valyrian steel bites deep and sharp. She had only to look at the scars to remember. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Outside, Shadd was stirring oats into a kettle, while Ser Wendel Manderly sat stringing </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his bow. “My lady,” he said when Catelyn emerged. “There are birds in this grass. Would you </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning?” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Oats and bread are sufficient . . . for all of us, I think. We have many leagues yet to ride, </text>

<text top="1032" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As you will, my lady.” The knight’s moon face looked crestfallen, the tips of his great </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="584" height="15" font="1">“Found some nettles and brewed a tea,” Shadd announced. “Will m’lady take a cup?” </text>

<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She cradled the tea in her scarred hands and blew on it to cool it. Shadd was one of the </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Winterfell men. Robb had sent twenty of his best to see her safely to Renly. He had sent five </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lordlings as well, whose names and high birth would add weight and honor to her mission. As </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they made their way south, staying well clear of towns and holdfasts, they had seen bands of </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mailed men more than once, and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon, but none had dared </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">molest them. They were too weak to be a threat, too many to be easy prey. Once across the </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">Blackwater, the worst was behind. For the past four days, they had seen no signs of war. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn had never wanted this. She had told Robb as much, back in Riverrun. “When last </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">I saw Renly, he was a boy no older than Bran. I do not know him. Send someone else. My </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her son had looked at her unhappily. “There is no one else. I cannot go myself. Your </text>

<text top="469" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“March?” No one had said a word to her of marching. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I cannot sit at Riverrun waiting for peace. It makes me look as if I were afraid to take </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the field again. When there are no battles to fight, men start to think of hearth and harvest, </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">Father told me that. Even my northmen grow restless.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>My northmen</i>, she thought. <i>He is even starting to talk like a king.</i> “No one has ever died </text>

<text top="603" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Robb shook his head stubbornly. “We’ve tossed some seeds in the wind, that’s all. If </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">your sister Lysa was coming to aid us, we would have heard by now. How many birds have </text>

<text top="661" left="139" width="570" height="15" font="1">if all I do is sit here while my army melts away around me swift as summer snow?” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“So rather than look craven, you will dance to Lord Tywin’s pipes?” she threw back. “He </text>

<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I said nothing of Harrenhal,” Robb said. “Now, will you go to Renly for me, or must I </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="139" height="15" font="1">send the Greatjon?” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The memory brought a wan smile to her face. Such an obvious ploy, that, yet deft for a </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boy of fifteen. Robb knew how ill-suited a man like Greatjon Umber would be to treat with a </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">man like Renly Baratheon, and he knew that she knew it as well. What could she do but </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">accede, praying that her father would live until her return? Had Lord Hoster been well, he </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would have gone himself, she knew. Still, that leave-taking was hard, hard. He did not even </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">know her when she came to say farewell. “Minisa,” he called her, “where are the children? </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">My little Cat, my sweet Lysa . . .” Catelyn had kissed him on the brow and told him his babes </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were well. “Wait for me, my lord,” she said as his eyes closed. “I waited for you, oh, so many </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="243" height="15" font="1">times. Now you must wait for me.” </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Fate drives me south and south again</i>, Catelyn thought as she sipped the astringent tea, </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>when it is north I should be going, north to home.</i> She had written to Bran and Rickon, that </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">last night at Riverrun. <i>I do not forget you, my sweet ones, you must believe that. It is only that </i></text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="5"><i>your brother needs me more.</i> </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We ought to reach the upper Mander today, my lady,” Ser Wendel announced while </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her bowl was empty, though she could scarce remember tasting the porridge. She laid it </text>

<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">home. She was the first one mounted, and she set the pace for the column. Hal Mollen rode </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="587" height="15" font="1">beside her, bearing the banner of House Stark, the grey direwolf on an ice-white field. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They were still a half-day’s ride from Renly’s camp when they were taken. Robin Flint </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had ranged ahead to scout, and he came galloping back with word of a far-eyes watching from </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the roof of a distant windmill. By the time Catelyn’s party reached the mill, the man was long </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gone. They pressed on, covering not quite a mile before Renly’s outriders came swooping </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down on them, twenty men mailed and mounted, led by a grizzled greybeard of a knight with </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">bluejays on his surcoat. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When he saw her banners, he trotted up to her alone. “My lady,” he called, “I am Ser </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">Colen of Greenpools, as it please you. These are dangerous lands you cross.” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Our business is urgent,” she answered him. “I come as envoy from my son, Robb Stark, </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">the King in the North, to treat with Renly Baratheon, the King in the South.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“King Renly is the crowned and anointed lord of all the Seven Kingdoms, my lady,” Ser </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Colen answered, though courteously enough. “His Grace is encamped with his host near </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bitterbridge, where the roseroad crosses the Mander. It shall be my great honor to escort you </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to him.” The knight raised a mailed hand, and his men formed a double column flanking </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Catelyn and her guard. <i>Escort or captor?</i> she wondered. There was nothing to be done but </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">trust in Ser Colen’s honor, and Lord Renly’s. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">They saw the smoke of the camp’s fires when they were still an hour from the river. Then </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the sound came drifting across farm and field and rolling plain, indistinct as the murmur of </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">some distant sea, but swelling as they rode closer. By the time they caught sight of the </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mander’s muddy waters glinting in the sun, they could make out the voices of men, the clatter </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">of steel, the whinny of horses. Yet neither sound nor smoke prepared them for the host itself. </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Thousands of cookfires filled the air with a pale smoky haze. The horse lines alone </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stretched out over leagues. A forest had surely been felled to make the tall staffs that held the </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">banners. Great siege engines lined the grassy verge of the roseroad, mangonels and trebuchets </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and rolling rams mounted on wheels taller than a man on horseback. The steel points of pikes </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flamed red with sunlight, as if already blooded, while the pavilions of the knights and high </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lords sprouted from the grass like silken mushrooms. She saw men with spears and men with </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">swords, men in steel caps and mail shirts, camp followers strutting their charms, archers </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fletching arrows, teamsters driving wagons, swineherds driving pigs, pages running messages, </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">squires honing swords, knights riding palfreys, grooms leading ill-tempered destriers. “This is </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a fearsome lot of men,” Ser Wendel Manderly observed as they crossed the ancient stone span </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="269" height="15" font="1">from which Bitterbridge took its name. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="194" height="15" font="1">“That it is,” Catelyn agreed. </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Near all the chivalry of the south had come to Renly’s call, it seemed. The golden rose of </text>

<text top="310" left="171" width="593" height="15" font="1">“My lady, do you hear that noise?” asked Hallis Mollen, trotting close. “What is that?” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She listened. Shouts, and horses screaming, and the clash of steel, and . . . “Cheering,” </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">she said. They had been riding up a gentle slope toward a line of brightly colored pavilions on </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the height. As they passed between them, the press of men grew thicker, the sounds louder. </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="128" height="15" font="1">And then she saw. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Below, beneath the stone-and-timber battlements of a small castle, a melee was in </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">progress. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">A field had been cleared off, fences and galleries and tilting barriers thrown up. </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Hundreds were gathered to watch, perhaps thousands. From the looks of the grounds, torn and </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">muddy and littered with bits of dinted armor and broken lances, they had been at it for a day </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">or more, but now the end was near. Fewer than a score of knights remained ahorse, charging </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and slashing at each other as watchers and fallen combatants cheered them on. She saw two </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">destriers collide in full armor, going down in a tangle of steel and horseflesh. “A tourney,” </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="519" height="15" font="1">Hal Mollen declared. He had a penchant for loudly announcing the obvious. </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Oh, splendid,” Ser Wendel Manderly said as a knight in a rainbow-striped cloak </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wheeled to deliver a backhand blow with a long-handled axe that shattered the shield of the </text>

<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The press in front of them made further progress difficult. “Lady Stark,” Ser Colen said, </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">“if your men would be so good as to wait here, I’ll present you to the king.” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“As you say.” She gave the command, though she had to raise her voice to be heard </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">above the tourney din. Ser Colen walked his horse slowly through the throngs, with Catelyn </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">riding in his wake. A roar went up from the crowd as a helmetless red-bearded man with a </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">griffin on his shield went down before a big knight in blue armor. His steel was a deep cobalt, </text>

<text top="836" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“Red Ronnet’s down, gods be damned,” a man cursed. </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Loras’ll do for that blue—” a companion answered before a roar drowned out the rest of </text>

<text top="906" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Another man was fallen, trapped beneath his injured horse, both of them screaming in </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">pain. Squires rushed out to aid them. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>This is madness</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>Real enemies on every side and half the realm in </i></text>

<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ring of roses exquisitely wrought; at the front lifted a stag’s head of dark green jade, adorned </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="252" height="15" font="1">with golden eyes and golden antlers. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The crowned stag decorated the king’s green velvet tunic as well, worked in gold thread </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">upon his chest; the Baratheon sigil in the colors of Highgarden. The girl who shared the high </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seat with him was also of Highgarden: his young queen, Margaery, daughter to Lord Mace </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Tyrell. Their marriage was the mortar that held the great southron alliance together, Catelyn </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knew. Renly was one-and-twenty, the girl no older than Robb, very pretty, with a doe’s soft </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eyes and a mane of curling brown hair that fell about her shoulders in lazy ringlets. Her smile </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">was shy and sweet. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Out in the field, another man lost his seat to the knight in the rainbow-striped cloak, and </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the king shouted approval with the rest. “<i>Loras!</i>” she heard him call. “<i>Loras! Highgarden!</i>” </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="362" height="15" font="1">The queen clapped her hands together in excitement. </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn turned to see the end of it. Only four men were left in the fight now, and there </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was small doubt whom king and commons favored. She had never met Ser Loras Tyrell, but </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">even in the distant north one heard tales of the prowess of the young Knight of Flowers. Ser </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Loras rode a tall white stallion in silver mail, and fought with a long-handled axe. A crest of </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="312" height="15" font="1">golden roses ran down the center of his helm. </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Two of the other survivors had made common cause. They spurred their mounts toward </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the knight in the cobalt armor. As they closed to either side, the blue knight reined hard, </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smashing one man full in the face with his splintered shield while his black destrier lashed out </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with a steel-shod hoof at the other. In a blink, one combatant was unhorsed, the other reeling. </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his left arm, and then the </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Knight of Flowers was on him. The weight of his steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="565" height="15" font="1">and quickness with which Ser Loras moved, his rainbow cloak swirling about him. </text>
<text top="786" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest dance, the riders </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">throwing steel in place of kisses. Longaxe flashed and morningstar whirled. Both weapons </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were blunted, yet still they raised an awful clangor. Shieldless, the blue knight was getting </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">much the worse of it. Ser Loras rained down blows on his head and shoulders, to shouts of </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“<i>Highgarden!</i>” from the throng. The other gave answer with his morningstar, but whenever </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the ball came crashing in, Ser Loras interposed his battered green shield, emblazoned with </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">three golden roses. When the longaxe caught the blue knight’s hand on the backswing and </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">sent the morningstar flying from his grasp, the crowd screamed like a rutting beast. The </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="351" height="15" font="1">Knight of Flowers raised his axe for the final blow. </text>
<text top="967" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The blue knight charged into it. The stallions slammed together, the blunted axehead </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">smashed against the scarred blue breastplate . . . but somehow the blue knight had the haft </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">locked between steel-gauntleted fingers. He wrenched it from Ser Loras’s hand, and suddenly </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the two were grappling mount-to-mount, and an instant later they were falling. As their horses </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pulled apart, they crashed to the ground with bone-jarring force. Loras Tyrell, on the bottom, </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">took the brunt of the impact. The blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open Tyrell’s </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">visor. The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear what Ser Loras said, but she saw </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="311" height="15" font="1">the word form on his split, bloody lips. <i>Yield.</i> </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The blue knight climbed unsteady to his feet, and raised his dirk in the direction of Renly </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Baratheon, the salute of a champion to his king. Squires dashed onto the field to help the </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">vanquished knight to his feet. When they got his helm off, Catelyn was startled to see how </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">young he was. He could not have had more than two years on Robb. The boy might have been </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as comely as his sister, but the broken lip, unfocused eyes, and blood trickling through his </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="262" height="15" font="1">matted hair made it hard to be certain. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="335" height="15" font="1">“Approach,” King Renly called to the champion. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He limped toward the gallery. At close hand, the brilliant blue armor looked rather less </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">splendid; everywhere it showed scars, the dents of mace and warhammer, the long gouges left </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by swords, chips in the enameled breastplate and helm. His cloak hung in rags. From the way </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">he moved, the man within was no less battered. A few voices hailed him with cries of </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“<i>Tarth!</i>” and, oddly, “<i>A Beauty! A Beauty!</i>” but most were silent. The blue knight knelt before </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">the king. “Grace,” he said, his voice muffled by his dented greathelm. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You are all your lord father claimed you were.” Renly’s voice carried over the field. </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">“I’ve seen Ser Loras unhorsed once or twice . . . but never quite in <i>that</i> fashion.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“That were no proper unhorsing,” complained a drunken archer nearby, a Tyrell rose </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">sewn on his jerkin. “A vile trick, pulling the lad down.” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The press had begun to open up. “Ser Colen,” Catelyn said to her escort, “who is this </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">man, and why do they mislike him so?” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Ser Colen frowned. “Because he is no man, my lady. That’s Brienne of Tarth, daughter to </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">Lord Selwyn the Evenstar.” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“<i>Daughter?</i>” Catelyn was horrified. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Brienne the Beauty, they name her . . . though not to her face, lest they be called upon to </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="266" height="15" font="1">defend those words with their bodies.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She heard King Renly declare the Lady Brienne of Tarth the victor of the great melee at </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bitterbridge, last mounted of one hundred sixteen knights. “As champion, you may ask of me </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">any boon that you desire. If it lies in my power, it is yours.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace,” Brienne answered, “I ask the honor of a place among your Rainbow </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Guard. I would be one of your seven, and pledge my life to yours, to go where you go, ride at </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">your side, and keep you safe from all hurt and harm.” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">“Done,” he said. “Rise, and remove your helm.” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">She did as he bid her. And when the greathelm was lifted, Catelyn understood Ser </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">Colen’s words. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Beauty, they called her . . . mocking. The hair beneath the visor was a squirrel’s nest of </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">dirty  straw,  and  her  face . . . Brienne’s  eyes  were large and very blue, a young girl’s eyes, </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trusting and guileless, but the rest . . . her features were broad and coarse, her teeth prominent </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and crooked, her mouth too wide, her lips so plump they seemed swollen. A thousand freckles </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">speckled her cheeks and brow, and her nose had been broken more than once. Pity filled </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="556" height="15" font="1">Catelyn’s heart. <i>Is there any creature on earth as unfortunate as an ugly woman?</i> </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">And yet, when Renly cut away her torn cloak and fastened a rainbow in its place, Brienne </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of Tarth did not look unfortunate. Her smile lit up her face, and her voice was strong and </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">proud as she said, “My life for yours, Your Grace. From this day on, I am your shield, I swear </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">it by the old gods and the new.” The way she looked at the king—looked <i>down</i>  at  him,  she </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace!” Ser Colen of Greenpools swung down off his horse to approach the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gallery. “I beg your leave.” He went to one knee. “I have the honor to bring you the Lady </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="458" height="15" font="1">Catelyn Stark, sent as envoy by her son Robb, Lord of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lord of Winterfell and King in the North, ser,” Catelyn corrected him. She dismounted </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">and moved to Ser Colen’s side. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">King Renly looked surprised. “Lady Catelyn? We are most pleased.” He turned to his </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">young queen. “Margaery my sweet, this is the Lady Catelyn Stark of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You are most welcome here, Lady Stark,” the girl said, all soft courtesy. “I am sorry for </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">your loss.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="205" height="15" font="1">“You are kind,” said Catelyn. </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“My lady, I swear to you, I will see that the Lannisters answer for your husband’s </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">murder,” the king declared. “When I take King’s Landing, I’ll send you Cersei’s head.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>And will that bring my Ned back to me?</i> she thought. “It will be enough to know that </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="222" height="15" font="1">justice has been done, my lord.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Your Grace</i>,” Brienne the Blue corrected sharply. “And you should kneel when you </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">approach the king.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The distance between a <i>lord</i> and a <i>grace</i> is a small one, my lady,” Catelyn said. “Lord </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Renly wears a crown, as does my son. If you wish, we may stand here in the mud and debate </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">what honors and titles are rightly due to each, but it strikes me that we have more pressing </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="145" height="15" font="1">matters to consider.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Some of Renly’s lords bristled at that, but the king only laughed. “Well said, my lady. </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">There will be time enough for <i>graces</i> when these wars are done. Tell me, when does your son </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">mean to march against Harrenhal?” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Until she knew whether this king was friend or foe, Catelyn was not about to reveal the </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">least part of Robb’s dispositions. “I do not sit on my son’s war councils, my lord.” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“So long as he leaves a few Lannisters for me, I’ll not complain. What has he done with </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">the Kingslayer?” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="321" height="15" font="1">“Jaime Lannister is held prisoner at Riverrun.” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“Still alive?” Lord Mathis Rowan seemed dismayed. </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="514" height="15" font="1">Bemused, Renly said, “It would seem the direwolf is gentler than the lion.” </text>
<text top="818" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Gentler than the Lannisters,” murmured Lady Oakheart with a bitter smile, “is drier than </text>
<text top="837" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">the sea.” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I call it weak.” Lord Randyll Tarly had a short, bristly grey beard and a reputation for </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blunt speech. “No disrespect to you, Lady Stark, but it would have been more seemly had </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lord Robb come to pay homage to the king himself, rather than hiding behind his mother’s </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">skirts.” </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“<i>King</i> Robb is warring, my lord,” Catelyn replied with icy courtesy, “not playing at </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">tourney.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Renly grinned. “Go softly, Lord Randyll, I fear you’re overmatched.” He summoned a </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steward in the livery of Storm’s End. “Find a place for the lady’s companions, and see that </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they have every comfort. Lady Catelyn shall have my own pavilion. Since Lord Caswell has </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">been so kind as to give me use of his castle, I have no need of it. My lady, when you are </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rested, I would be honored if you would share our meat and mead at the feast Lord Caswell is </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">giving us tonight. A farewell feast. I fear his lordship is eager to see the heels of my hungry </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">horde.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Not true, Your Grace,” protested a wispy young man who must have been Caswell. </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">“What is mine is yours.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Whenever someone said that to my brother Robert, he took them at their word,” Renly </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">said. “Do you have daughters?” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="177" height="15" font="1">“Yes, Your Grace. Two.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then thank the gods that I am not Robert. My sweet queen is all the woman I desire.” </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Renly held out his hand to help Margaery to her feet. “We’ll talk again when you’ve had a </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">chance to refresh yourself, Lady Catelyn.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Renly led his bride back toward the castle while his steward conducted Catelyn to the </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="612" height="15" font="1">king’s green silk pavilion. “If you have need of anything, you have only to ask, my lady.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could scarcely imagine what she might need that had not already been provided. </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The pavilion was larger than the common rooms of many an inn and furnished with every </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">comfort: feather mattress and sleeping furs, a wood-and-copper tub large enough for two, </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">braziers, to keep off the night’s chill, slung leather camp chairs, a writing table with quills and </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">inkpot, bowls of peaches, plums, and pears, a flagon of wine with a set of matched silver </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cups, cedar chests packed full of Renly’s clothing, books, maps, game boards, a high harp, a </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tall bow and a quiver of arrows, a pair of red-tailed hunting hawks, a veritable armory of fine </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">weapons. <i>He does not stint himself, this Renly</i>, she thought as she looked about. <i>Small wonder </i></text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="179" height="15" font="5"><i>this host moves so slowly.</i> </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beside the entrance, the king’s armor stood sentry; a suit of forest-green plate, its fittings </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chased with gold, the helm crowned by a great rack of golden antlers. The steel was polished </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to such a high sheen that she could see her reflection in the breastplate, gazing back at her as </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">if from the bottom of a deep green pond. <i>The face of a drowned woman</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>Can </i></text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>you drown in grief?</i> She turned away sharply, angry with her own frailty. She had no time for </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the luxury of self-pity. She must wash the dust from her hair and change into a gown more </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">fitting for a king’s feast. </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Wendel Manderly, Lucas Blackwood, Ser Perwyn Frey, and the rest of her highborn </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">companions accompanied her to the castle. The great hall of Lord Caswell’s keep was great </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">only by courtesy, yet room was found on the crowded benches for Catelyn’s men, amidst </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Renly’s own knights. Catelyn was assigned a place on the dais between red-faced Lord </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Mathis Rowan and genial Ser Jon Fossoway of the green-apple Fossoways. Ser Jon made </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">jests, while Lord Mathis inquired politely after the health of her father, brother, and children. </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Brienne of Tarth had been seated at the far end of the high table. She did not gown </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">herself as a lady, but chose a knight’s finery instead, a velvet doublet quartered rose-and-</text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">azure, breeches and boots and a fine-tooled swordbelt, her new rainbow cloak flowing down </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her back. No garb could disguise her plainness, though; the huge freckled hands, the wide flat </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face, the thrust of her teeth. Out of armor, her body seemed ungainly, broad of hip and thick </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of limb, with hunched muscular shoulders but no bosom to speak of. And it was clear from </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her every action that Brienne knew it, and suffered for it. She spoke only in answer, and </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">seldom lifted her gaze from her food. </text>
<text top="978" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Of food there was plenty. The war had not touched the fabled bounty of Highgarden. </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">While singers sang and tumblers tumbled, they began with pears poached in wine, and went </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on to tiny savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp, and capons stuffed with onions and </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mushrooms. There were great loaves of brown bread, mounds of turnips and sweetcorn and </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pease, immense hams and roast geese and trenchers dripping full of venison stewed with beer </text>
</page>
<page number="186" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and barley. For the sweet, Lord Caswell’s servants brought down trays of pastries from his </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">castle kitchens, cream swans and spun-sugar unicorns, lemon cakes in the shape of roses, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="581" height="15" font="1">spiced honey biscuits and blackberry tarts, apple crisps and wheels of buttery cheese. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The rich foods made Catelyn queasy, but it would never do to show frailty when so much </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">depended on her strength. She ate sparingly, while she watched this man who would be king. </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Renly sat with his young bride on his left hand and her brother on the right. Apart from the </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">white linen bandage around his brow, Ser Loras seemed none the worse for the day’s </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">misadventures. He was indeed as comely as Catelyn had suspected he might be. When not </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">glazed, his eyes were lively and intelligent, his hair an artless tumble of brown locks that </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">many a maid might have envied. He had replaced his tattered tourney cloak with a new one; </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the same brilliantly striped silk of Renly’s Rainbow Guard, clasped with the golden rose of </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">Highgarden. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">From time to time, King Renly would feed Margaery some choice morsel off the point of </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his dagger, or lean over to plant the lightest of kisses on her cheek, but it was Ser Loras who </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shared most of his jests and confidences. The king enjoyed his food and drink, that was plain </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to see, yet he seemed neither glutton nor drunkard. He laughed often, and well, and spoke </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">amiably to highborn lords and lowly serving wenches alike. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Some of his guests were less moderate. They drank too much and boasted too loudly, to </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her mind. Lord Willum’s sons Josua and Elyas disputed heatedly about who would be first </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">over the walls of King’s Landing. Lord Varner dandled a serving girl on his lap, nuzzling at </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her neck while one hand went exploring down her bodice. Guyard the Green, who fancied </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself a singer, diddled a harp and gave them a verse about tying lions’ tails in knots, parts </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of which rhymed. Ser Mark Mullendore brought a black-and-white monkey and fed him </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">morsels from his own plate, while Ser Tanton of the red-apple Fossoways climbed on the </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">table and swore to slay Sandor Clegane in single combat. The vow might have been taken </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="568" height="15" font="1">more solemnly if Ser Tanton had not had one foot in a gravy boat when he made it. </text>
<text top="633" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The height of folly was reached when a plump fool came capering out in gold-painted tin </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with a cloth lion’s head, and chased a dwarf around the tables, whacking him over the head </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with a bladder. Finally King Renly demanded to know why he was beating his brother. “Why, </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">Your Grace, I’m the Kinslayer,” the fool said. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="517" height="15" font="1">“It’s <i>King</i>slayer, fool of a fool,” Renly said, and the hall rang with laughter. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="575" height="15" font="1">Lord Rowan beside her did not join the merriment. “They are all so young,” he said. </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was true. The Knight of Flowers could not have reached his second name day when </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Robert slew Prince Rhaegar on the Trident. Few of the others were very much older. They </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">had been babes during the Sack of King’s Landing, and no more than boys when Balon </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Greyjoy raised the Iron Islands in rebellion. <i>They are still unblooded</i>, Catelyn thought as she </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watched Lord Bryce goad Ser Robar into juggling a brace of daggers. <i>It is all a game to them </i></text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>still, a tourney writ large, and all they see is the chance for glory and honor and spoils. They </i></text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="574" height="15" font="5"><i>are boys drunk on song and story, and like all boys, they think themselves immortal.</i> </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“War will make them old,” Catelyn said, “as it did us.” She had been a girl when Robert </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Ned and Jon Arryn raised their banners against Aerys Targaryen, a woman by the time </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">the fighting was done. “I pity them.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Why?” Lord Rowan asked her. “Look at them. They’re young and strong, full of life </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and laughter. And lust, aye, more lust than they know what to do with. There will be many a </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="345" height="15" font="1">bastard bred this night, I promise you. Why pity?” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Because it will not last,” Catelyn answered, sadly. “Because they are the knights of </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="222" height="15" font="1">summer, and winter is coming.” </text>
</page>
<page number="187" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Lady Catelyn, you are wrong.” Brienne regarded her with eyes as blue as her armor. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Winter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">us, and it’s always summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">beautiful, and the sun is always shining.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Winter comes for all of us</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>For me, it came when Ned died. It will come </i></text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="544" height="15" font="5"><i>for you too, child, and sooner than you like.</i> She did not have the heart to say it. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The king saved her. “Lady Catelyn,” Renly called down. “I feel the need of some air. </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">Will you walk with me?” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="313" height="15" font="1">Catelyn stood at once. “I should be honored.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Brienne was on her feet as well. “Your Grace, give me but a moment to don my mail. </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="270" height="15" font="1">You should not be without protection.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">King Renly smiled. “If I am not safe in the heart of Lord Caswell’s castle, with my own </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">host around me, one sword will make no matter . . . not even your sword, Brienne. Sit and eat. </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="276" height="15" font="1">If I have need of you, I’ll send for you.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His words seemed to strike the girl harder than any blow she had taken that afternoon. </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“As you will, Your Grace.” Brienne sat, eyes downcast. Renly took Catelyn’s arm and led her </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from the hall, past a slouching guardsman who straightened so hurriedly that he near dropped </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="482" height="15" font="1">his spear. Renly clapped the man on the shoulder and made a jest of it. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“This way, my lady.” The king took her through a low door into a stair tower. As they </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">started up, he said, “Perchance, is Ser Barristan Selmy with your son at Riverrun?” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“No,” she answered, puzzled. “Is he no longer with Joffrey? He was the Lord </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">Commander of the Kingsguard.” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly shook his head. “The Lannisters told him he was too old and gave his cloak to the </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Hound. I’m told he left King’s Landing vowing to take up service with the true king. That </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cloak Brienne claimed today was the one I was keeping for Selmy, in hopes that he might </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">offer me his sword. When he did not turn up at Highgarden, I thought perhaps he had gone to </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="128" height="15" font="1">Riverrun instead.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="174" height="15" font="1">“We have not seen him.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He was old, yes, but a good man still. I hope he has not come to harm. The Lannisters </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">are great fools.” They climbed a few more steps. “On the night of Robert’s death, I offered </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">your husband a hundred swords and urged him to take Joffrey into his power. Had he listened, </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="615" height="15" font="1">he would be regent today, and there would have been no need for me to claim the throne.” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“Ned refused you.” She did not have to be told. </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He had sworn to protect Robert’s children,” Renly said. “I lacked the strength to act </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">alone, so when Lord Eddard turned me away, I had no choice but to flee. Had I stayed, I knew </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">the queen would see to it that I did not long outlive my brother.” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Had you stayed, and lent your support to Ned, he might still be alive</i>, Catelyn thought </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">bitterly. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“I liked your husband well enough, my lady. He was a loyal friend to Robert, I </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">know . . . but he would not listen and he would not bend. Here, I wish to show you </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">something.” They had reached the top of the stairwell. Renly pushed open a wooden door, and </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="211" height="15" font="1">they stepped out onto the roof. </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Caswell’s keep was scarcely tall enough to call a tower, but the country was low </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and flat and Catelyn could see for leagues in all directions. Wherever she looked, she saw </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fires. They covered the earth like fallen stars, and like the stars there was no end to them. </text>

<page number="188" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Count them if you like, my lady,” Renly said quietly. “You will still be counting when dawn </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">breaks in the east. How many fires burn around Riverrun tonight, I wonder?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could hear faint music drifting from the Great Hall, seeping out into the night. </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">She dare not count the stars. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’m told your son crossed the Neck with twenty thousand swords at his back,” Renly </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">went on. “Now that the lords of the Trident are with him, perhaps he commands forty </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="77" height="15" font="1">thousand.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="602" height="15" font="5"><i>No</i>, she thought, <i>not near so many, we have lost men in battle, and others to the harvest.</i> </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have twice that number here,” Renly said, “and this is only part of my strength. Mace </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Tyrell remains at Highgarden with another ten thousand, I have a strong garrison holding </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End, and soon enough the Dornishmen will join me with all their power. And never </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">forget my brother Stannis, who holds Dragonstone and commands the lords of the narrow </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">sea.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It would seem that you are the one who has forgotten Stannis,” Catelyn said, more </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">sharply than she’d intended. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“His claim, you mean?” Renly laughed. “Let us be blunt, my lady. Stannis would make </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">an appalling king. Nor is he like to become one. Men respect Stannis, even fear him, but </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">precious few have ever loved him.” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He is still your elder brother. If either of you can be said to have a right to the Iron </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">Throne, it must be Lord Stannis.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Renly shrugged. “Tell me, what right did my brother Robert ever have to the Iron </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Throne?” He did not wait for an answer. “Oh, there was talk of the blood ties between </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Baratheon and Targaryen, of weddings a hundred years past, of second sons and elder </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">daughters. No one but the maesters care about any of it. Robert won the throne with his </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">warhammer.” He swept a hand across the campfires that burned from horizon to horizon. </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Well, there is my claim, as good as Robert’s ever was. If your son supports me as his father </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">supported Robert, he’ll not find me ungenerous. I will gladly confirm him in all his lands, </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">titles, and honors. He can rule in Winterfell as he pleases. He can even go on calling himself </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">King in the North if he likes, so long as he bends the knee and does me homage as his </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">overlord. <i>King</i> is only a word, but fealty, loyalty, service . . . those I must have.” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="327" height="15" font="1">“And if he will not give them to you, my lord?” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I mean to be king, my lady, and not of a broken kingdom. I cannot say it plainer than </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that. Three hundred years ago, a Stark king knelt to Aegon the Dragon, when he saw he could </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not hope to prevail. That was wisdom. Your son must be wise as well. Once he joins me, this </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="588" height="15" font="1">war is good as done. We—” Renly broke off suddenly, distracted. “What’s this now?” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The rattle of chains heralded the raising of the portcullis. Down in the yard below, a rider </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in a winged helm urged his well-lathered horse under the spikes. “Summon the king!” he </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">called. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">Renly vaulted up into a crenel. “I’m here, ser.” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace.” The rider spurred his mount closer. “I came swift as I could. From </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End. We are besieged, Your Grace, Ser Cortnay defies them, but . . .” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="563" height="15" font="1">“But . . . that’s not possible. I would have been told if Lord Tywin left Harrenhal.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“These are no Lannisters, my liege. It’s Lord Stannis at your gates. <i>King</i> Stannis, he calls </text>

<text top="154" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A blowing rain lashed at Jon’s face as he spurred his horse across the swollen stream. </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Beside him, Lord Commander Mormont gave the hood of his cloak a tug, muttering curses on </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the weather. His raven sat on his shoulder, feathers ruffled, as soaked and grumpy as the Old </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bear himself. A gust of wind sent wet leaves flapping round them like a flock of dead birds. </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="507" height="15" font="5"><i>The haunted forest</i>, Jon thought ruefully. <i>The drowned forest, more like it.</i> </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He hoped Sam was holding up, back down the column. He was not a good rider even in </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fair weather, and six days of rain had made the ground treacherous, all soft mud and hidden </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">rocks. When the wind blew, it drove the water right into their eyes. The Wall would be </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flowing off to the south, the melting ice mingling with warm rain to wash down in sheets and </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rivers. Pyp and Toad would be sitting near the fire in the common room, drinking cups of </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mulled wine before their supper. Jon envied them. His wet wool clung to him sodden and </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">itching, his neck and shoulders ached fiercely from the weight of mail and sword, and he was </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">sick of salt cod, salt beef, and hard cheese. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Up ahead a hunting horn sounded a quavering note, half-drowned beneath the constant </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">patter of the rain. “Buckwell’s horn,” the Old Bear announced. “The gods are good; Craster’s </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">still there.” His raven gave a single flap of his big wings, croaked “<i>Corn</i>,” and ruffled his </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="124" height="15" font="1">feathers up again. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon had often heard the black brothers tell tales of Craster and his keep. Now he would </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">see it with his own eyes. After seven empty villages, they had all come to dread finding </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Craster’s as dead and desolate as the rest, but it seemed they would be spared that. <i>Perhaps </i></text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="5"><i>the Old Bear will finally get some answers</i>, he thought. <i>Anyway, we’ll be out of the rain.</i> </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Thoren Smallwood swore that Craster was a friend to the Watch, despite his unsavory </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">reputation. “The man’s half-mad, I won’t deny it,” he’d told the Old Bear, “but you’d be the </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">same if you’d spent your life in this cursed wood. Even so, he’s never turned a ranger away </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="514" height="15" font="1">from his fire, nor does he love Mance Rayder. He’ll give us good counsel.” </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>So long as he gives us a hot meal and a chance to dry our clothes, I’ll be happy.</i> Dywen </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">said Craster was a kinslayer, liar, raper, and craven, and hinted that he trafficked with slavers </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and demons. “And worse,” the old forester would add, clacking his wooden teeth. “There’s a </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="220" height="15" font="5"><i>cold</i> smell to that one, there is.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Jon,” Lord Mormont commanded, “ride back along the column and spread the word. </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">And remind the officers that I want no trouble about Craster’s wives. The men are to mind </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="401" height="15" font="1">their hands and speak to these women as little as need be.” </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aye, my lord.” Jon turned his horse back the way they’d come. It was pleasant to have </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the rain out of his face, if only for a little while. Everyone he passed seemed to be weeping. </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="385" height="15" font="1">The march was strung out through half a mile of woods. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the midst of the baggage train, Jon passed Samwell Tarly, slumped in his saddle under </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a wide floppy hat. He was riding one dray horse and leading the others. The drumming of the </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rain against the hoods of their cages had the ravens squawking and fluttering. “You put a fox </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="208" height="15" font="1">in with them?” Jon called out. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Water ran off the brim of Sam’s hat as he lifted his head. “Oh, hullo, Jon. No, they just </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">hate the rain, the same as us.” </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="198" height="15" font="1">“How are you faring, Sam?” </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="524" height="15" font="1">“Wetly.” The fat boy managed a smile. “Nothing has killed me yet, though.” </text>
<text top="1059" left="171" width="595" height="15" font="1">“Good. Craster’s Keep is just ahead. If the gods are good, he’ll let us sleep by his fire.” </text>
</page>
<page number="190" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sam looked dubious. “Dolorous Edd says Craster’s a terrible savage. He marries his </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">daughters and obeys no laws but those he makes himself. And Dywen told Grenn he’s got </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">black blood in his veins. His mother was a wildling woman who lay with a ranger, so he’s a </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="384" height="15" font="1">bas . . .” Suddenly he realized what he was about to say. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A bastard,” Jon said with a laugh. “You can say it, Sam. I’ve heard the word before.” </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He put the spurs to his surefooted little garron. “I need to hunt down Ser Ottyn. Be careful </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">around Craster’s women.” As if Samwell Tarly needed warning on that score. “We’ll talk </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">later, after we’ve made camp.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon carried the word back to Ser Ottyn Wythers, plodding along with the rear guard. A </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">small prune-faced man of an age with Mormont, Ser Ottyn always looked tired, even at Castle </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Black, and the rain had beaten him down unmercifully. “Welcome tidings,” he said. “This wet </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">has soaked my bones, and even my saddle sores complain of saddle sores.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">On his way back, Jon swung wide of the column’s line of march and took a shorter path </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through the thick of the wood. The sounds of man and horse diminished, swallowed up by the </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wet green wild, and soon enough he could hear only the steady wash of rain against leaf and </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tree and rock. It was mid-afternoon, yet the forest seemed as dark as dusk. Jon wove a path </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="652" height="15" font="1">between rocks and puddles, past great oaks, grey-green sentinels, and black-barked </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ironwoods. In places the branches wove a canopy overhead and he was given a moment’s </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">respite from the drumming of the rain against his head. As he rode past a lightning-blasted </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chestnut tree overgrown with wild white roses, he heard something rustling in the underbrush. </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="270" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ghost</i>,” he called out. “Ghost, to me.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But it was Dywen who emerged from the greenery, forking a shaggy grey garron with </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Grenn ahorse beside him. The Old Bear had deployed outriders to either side of the main </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">column, to screen their march and warn of the approach of any enemies, and even there he </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="318" height="15" font="1">took no chances, sending the men out in pairs. </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Ah, it’s you, Lord Snow.” Dywen smiled an oaken smile; his teeth were carved of </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wood, and fit badly. “Thought me and the boy had us one o’ them Others to deal with. Lose </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="86" height="15" font="1">your wolf?” </text>
<text top="683" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He’s off hunting.” Ghost did not like to travel with the column, but he would not be far. </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">When they made camp for the night, he’d find his way to Jon at the Lord Commander’s tent. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="313" height="15" font="1">“Fishing, I’d call it, in this wet,” Dywen said. </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="570" height="15" font="1">“My mother always said rain was good for growing crops,” Grenn put in hopefully. </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Aye, a good crop of mildew,” Dywen said. “The best thing about a rain like this, it saves </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">a man from taking baths.” He made a clacking sound on his wooden teeth. </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">“Buckwell’s found Craster,” Jon told them. </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Had he lost him?” Dywen chuckled. “See that you young bucks don’t go nosing about </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="191" height="15" font="1">Craster’s wives, you hear?” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">Jon smiled. “Want them all for yourself, Dywen?” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dywen clacked his teeth some more. “Might be I do. Craster’s got ten fingers and one </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">cock, so he don’t count but to eleven. He’d never miss a couple.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="371" height="15" font="1">“How many wives does he have, truly?” Grenn asked. </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“More’n you ever will, brother. Well, it’s not so hard when you breed your own. There’s </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">your beast, Snow.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ghost was trotting along beside Jon’s horse with tail held high, his white fur ruffed-up </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thick against the rain. He moved so silently Jon could not have said just when he appeared. </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Grenn’s mount shied at the scent of him; even now, after more than a year, the horses were </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="631" height="15" font="1">uneasy in the presence of the direwolf. “With me, Ghost.” Jon spurred off to Craster’s Keep. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He had never thought to find a stone castle on the far side of the Wall, but he <i>had</i> </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pictured some sort of motte-and-bailey with a wooden palisade and a timber tower keep. What </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">they found instead was a midden heap, a pigsty, an empty sheepfold, and a windowless daub-</text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and-wattle hall scarce worthy of the name. It was long and low, chinked together from logs </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and roofed with sod. The compound stood atop a rise too modest to name a hill, surrounded </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">by an earthen dike. Brown rivulets flowed down the slope where the rain had eaten gaping </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">holes in the defenses, to join a rushing brook that curved around to the north, its thick waters </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">turned into a murky torrent by the rains. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">On the southwest, he found an open gate flanked by a pair of animal skulls on high poles: </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a bear to one side, a ram to the other. Bits of flesh still clung to the bear skull, Jon noted as he </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">joined the line riding past. Within, Jarman Buckwell’s scouts and men from Thoren </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Smallwood’s van were setting up horse lines and struggling to raise tents. A host of piglets </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rooted about three huge sows in the sty. Nearby, a small girl pulled carrots from a garden, </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">naked in the rain, while two women tied a pig for slaughter. The animal’s squeals were high </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and horrible, almost human in their distress. Chett’s hounds barked wildly in answer, snarling </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and snapping despite his curses, with a pair of Craster’s dogs barking back. When they saw </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ghost, some of the dogs broke off and ran, while others began to bay and growl. The direwolf </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">ignored them, as did Jon. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Well, thirty of us will be warm and dry</i>, Jon thought once he’d gotten a good look at the </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hall. <i>Perhaps as many as fifty.</i> The place was much too small to sleep two hundred men, so </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">most would need to remain outside. And where to put them? The rain had turned half the </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">compound yard to ankle-deep puddles and the rest to sucking mud. Another dismal night was </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">in prospect. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Lord Commander had entrusted his mount to Dolorous Edd. He was cleaning mud </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">out of the horse’s hooves as Jon dismounted. “Lord Mormont’s in the hall,” he announced. </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“He said for you to join him. Best leave the wolf outside, he looks hungry enough to eat one </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Craster’s children. Well, truth be told, <i>I’m</i> hungry enough to eat one of Craster’s children, </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">so long as he was served hot. Go on, I’ll see to your horse. If it’s warm and dry inside, don’t </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tell me, I wasn’t asked in.” He flicked a glob of wet mud out from under a horseshoe. “Does </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="1">this mud look like shit to you? Could it be that this whole hill is made of Craster’s shit?” </text>
<text top="755" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">Jon smiled. “Well, I hear he’s been here a long time.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="290" height="15" font="1">“You cheer me not. Go see the Old Bear.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Ghost, stay,” he commanded. The door to Craster’s Keep was made of two flaps of </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">deerhide. Jon shoved between them, stooping to pass under the low lintel. Two dozen of the </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chief rangers had preceded him, and were standing around the fire-pit in the center of the dirt </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">floor while puddles collected about their boots. The hall stank of soot, dung, and wet dog. The </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">air was heavy with smoke, yet somehow still damp. Rain leaked through the smoke hole in </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the roof. It was all a single room, with a sleeping loft above reached by a pair of splintery </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">ladders. </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon remembered how he’d felt the day they had left the Wall: nervous as a maiden, but </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eager to glimpse the mysteries and wonders beyond each new horizon. <i>Well, here’s one of the </i></text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>wonders</i>, he told himself, gazing about the squalid, foul-smelling hall. The acrid smoke was </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">making his eyes water. <i>A pity that Pyp and Toad can’t see all they’re missing.</i> </text>
<text top="1031" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Craster sat above the fire, the only man to enjoy his own chair. Even Lord Commander </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mormont must seat himself on the common bench, with his raven muttering on his shoulder. </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Jarman Buckwell stood behind, dripping from patched mail and shiny wet leather, beside </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="596" height="15" font="1">Thoren Smallwood in the late Ser Jaremy’s heavy breastplate and sable-trimmed cloak. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Craster’s sheepskin jerkin and cloak of sewn skins made a shabby contrast, but around </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one thick wrist was a heavy ring that had the glint of gold. He looked to be a powerful man, </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though well into the winter of his days now, his mane of hair grey going to white. A flat nose </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and a drooping mouth gave him a cruel look, and one of his ears was missing. <i>So this is a </i></text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>wildling.</i> Jon remembered Old Nan’s tales of the savage folk who drank blood from human </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">skulls. Craster seemed to be drinking a thin yellow beer from a chipped stone cup. Perhaps he </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">had not heard the stories. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ve not seen Benjen Stark for three years,” he was telling Mormont. “And if truth be </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">told, I never once missed him.” A half-dozen black puppies and the odd pig or two skulked </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">among the benches, while women in ragged deerskins passed horns of beer, stirred the fire, </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">and chopped carrots and onions into a kettle. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He ought to have passed here last year,” said Thoren Smallwood. A dog came sniffing </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">round his leg. He kicked it and sent it off yipping. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Mormont said, “Ben was searching for Ser Waymar Royce, who’d vanished with </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">Gared and young Will.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Aye, those three I recall. The lordling no older than one of these pups. Too proud to </text>

<text top="502" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all the same.” He turned his squint on the nearest of the women. “Gared says they were </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chasing raiders. I told him, with a commander that green, best not catch ‘em. Gared wasn’t </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">half-bad, for a crow. Had less ears than me, that one. The ‘bite took ‘em, same as mine.” </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="519" height="15" font="1">Craster laughed. “Now I hear he got no head neither. The ‘bite do that too?” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon remembered a spray of red blood on white snow, and the way Theon Greyjoy had </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kicked the dead man’s head. <i>The man was a deserter.</i> On the way back to Winterfell, Jon and </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">Robb had raced, and found six direwolf pups in the snow. A thousand years ago. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">“When Ser Waymar left you, where was he bound?” </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Craster gave a shrug. “Happens I have better things to do than tend to the comings and </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">goings of crows.” He drank a pull of beer and set the cup aside. “Had no good southron wine </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">up here for a bear’s night. I could use me some wine, and a new axe. Mine’s lost its bite, can’t </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="541" height="15" font="1">have that, I got me women to protect.” He gazed around at his scurrying wives. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You are few here, and isolated,” Mormont said. “If you like, I’ll detail some men to </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">escort you south to the Wall.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The raven seemed to like the notion. “<i>Wall</i>,” it screamed, spreading black wings like a </text>

<text top="848" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Their host gave a nasty smile, showing a mouthful of broken brown teeth. “And what </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">would we do there, serve you at supper? We’re free folk here. Craster serves no man.” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="516" height="15" font="1">“These are bad times to dwell alone in the wild. The cold winds are rising.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let them rise. My roots are sunk deep.” Craster grabbed a passing woman by the wrist. </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="429" height="15" font="1">“Tell him, wife. Tell the Lord Crow how well content we are.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The woman licked at thin lips. “This is our place. Craster keeps us safe. Better to die free </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="126" height="15" font="1">than live a slave.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">“<i>Slave</i>,” muttered the raven. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Mormont leaned forward. “Every village we have passed has been abandoned. Yours are </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the first living faces we’ve seen since we left the Wall. The people are gone . . . whether dead, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bodies of two of Ben Stark’s rangers only a few leagues from the Wall. They were pale and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cold, with black hands and black feet and wounds that did not bleed. Yet when we took them </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back to Castle Black they rose in the night and killed. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker and the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">other came for me, which tells me that they remember some of what they knew when they </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">lived, but there was no human mercy left in them.” </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The woman’s mouth hung open, a wet pink cave, but Craster only gave a snort. “We’ve </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had no such troubles here . . . and I’ll thank you not to tell such evil tales under my roof. I’m a </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">godly man, and the gods keep me safe. If wights come walking, I’ll know how to send them </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back to their graves. Though I could use me a sharp new axe.” He sent his wife scurrying with </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">a slap on her leg and a shout of “More beer, and be quick about it.” </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No trouble from the dead,” Jarman Buckwell said, “but what of the living, my lord? </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">What of your king?” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="354" height="15" font="1">“<i>King!</i>” cried Mormont’s raven. “<i>King, king, king.</i>” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That Mance Rayder?” Craster spit into the fire. “King-beyond-the-Wall. What do free </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">folk want with kings?” He turned his squint on Mormont. “There’s much I could tell you o’ </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Rayder and his doings, if I had a mind. This o’ the empty villages, that’s his work. You would </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">have found this hall abandoned as well, if I were a man to scrape to such. He sends a rider, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tells me I must leave my own keep to come grovel at his feet. I sent the man back, but kept his </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tongue. It’s nailed to that wall there.” He pointed. “Might be that I could tell you where to </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seek Mance Rayder. If I had a mind.” The brown smile again. “But we’ll have time enough </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="577" height="15" font="1">for that. You’ll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof, belike, and eat me out of pigs.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A roof would be most welcome, my lord,” Mormont said. “We’ve had hard riding, and </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">too much wet.” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then you’ll guest here for a night. No longer, I’m not that fond o’ crows. The loft’s for </text>

<text top="625" left="139" width="412" height="15" font="1">The rest o’ your black crows can peck after their own corn.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We’ve packed in our own supplies, my lord,” said the Old Bear. “We should be pleased </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">to share our food and wine.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Craster wiped his drooping mouth with the back of a hairy hand. “I’ll taste your wine, </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lord Crow, that I will. One more thing. Any man lays a hand on my wives, he loses the </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">hand.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Your roof, your rule,” said Thoren Smallwood, and Lord Mormont nodded stiffly, </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">though he looked none too pleased. </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“That’s settled, then.” Craster grudged them a grunt. “D’ya have a man can draw a </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">map?” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="398" height="15" font="1">“Sam Tarly can.” Jon pushed forward. “Sam loves maps.” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Mormont beckoned him closer. “Send him here after he’s eaten. Have him bring quill </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">and parchment. And find Tollett as well. Tell him to bring my axe. A guest gift for our host.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="589" height="15" font="1">“Who’s this one now?” Craster said before Jon could go. “He has the look of a Stark.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="253" height="15" font="1">“My steward and squire, Jon Snow.” </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A bastard, is it?” Craster looked Jon up and down. “Man wants to bed a woman, seems </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">like he ought to take her to wife. That’s what I do.” He shooed Jon off with a wave. “Well, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slackened. Tents had gone up all over the compound. Jon could see the tops of others under </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dolorous Edd was feeding the horses. “Give the wildling an axe, why not?” He pointed </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">out Mormont’s weapon, a short-hafted battle-axe with gold scrollwork inlaid on the black </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steel blade. “He’ll give it back, I vow. Buried in the Old Bear’s skull, like as not. Why not </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">give him <i>all</i> our axes, and our swords as well? I mislike the way they clank and rattle as we </text>

<text top="246" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">Perhaps Craster would like a nice hat instead.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">Jon smiled. “He wants an axe. And wine as well.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“See, the Old Bear’s clever. If we get the wildling well and truly drunk, perhaps he’ll </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="631" height="15" font="1">only cut off an ear when he tries to slay us with that axe. I have two ears but only one head.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“Smallwood says Craster is a friend to the Watch.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Do you know the difference between a wildling who’s a friend to the Watch and one </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">who’s not?” asked the dour squire. “Our enemies leave our bodies for the crows and the </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wolves. Our friends bury us in secret graves. I wonder how long that bear’s been nailed up on </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">that gate, and what Craster had there before we came hallooing?” Edd looked at the axe </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="463" height="15" font="1">doubtfully, the rain running down his long face. “Is it dry in there?” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="152" height="15" font="1">“Drier than out here.” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If I lurk about after, not too close to the fire, belike they’ll take no note of me till morn. </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">The ones under his roof will be the first he murders, but at least we’ll die dry.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">Jon had to laugh. “Craster’s one man. We’re two hundred. I doubt he’ll murder anyone.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You cheer me,” said Edd, sounding utterly morose. “And besides, there’s much to be </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">said for a good sharp axe. I’d hate to be murdered with a maul. I saw a man hit in the brow </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with a maul once. Scarce split the skin at all, but his head turned mushy and swelled up big as </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">a gourd, only purply-red. A comely man, but he died ugly. It’s good that we’re not giving </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">them mauls.” Edd walked away shaking his head, his sodden black cloak shedding rain </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">behind him. </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon got the horses fed before he stopped to think of his own supper. He was wondering </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">where to find Sam when he heard a shout of fear. “<i>Wolf!</i>” He sprinted around the hall toward </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the cry, the earth sucking at his boots. One of Craster’s women was backed up against the </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mud-spattered wall of the keep. “Keep away,” she was shouting at Ghost. “You keep away!” </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The direwolf had a rabbit in his mouth and another dead and bloody on the ground before </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="408" height="15" font="1">him. “Get it away, m’lord,” she pleaded when she saw him. </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He won’t hurt you.” He knew at once what had happened; a wooden hutch, its slats </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shattered, lay on its side in the wet grass. “He must have been hungry. We haven’t seen much </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">game.” Jon whistled. The direwolf bolted down the rabbit, crunching the small bones between </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">his teeth, and padded over to him. </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The woman regarded them with nervous eyes. She was younger than he’d thought at </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">first. A girl of fifteen or sixteen years, he judged, dark hair plastered across a gaunt face by </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the falling rain, her bare feet muddy to the ankles. The body under the sewn skins was </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">showing in the early turns of pregnancy. “Are you one of Craster’s daughters?” he asked. </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">She put a hand over her belly. “Wife now.” Edging away from the wolf, she knelt </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mournfully beside the broken hutch. “I was going to breed them rabbits. There’s no sheep </text>

<page number="195" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The Watch will make good for them.” Jon had no coin of his own, or he would have </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">offered it to her . . . though he was not sure what good a few coppers or even a silver piece </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">would do her beyond the Wall. “I’ll speak to Lord Mormont on the morrow.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">She wiped her hands on her skirt. “M’lord—” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="101" height="15" font="1">“I’m no lord.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">But others had come crowding round, drawn by the woman’s scream and the crash of the </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rabbit hutch. “Don’t you believe him, girl,” called out Lark the Sisterman, a ranger mean as a </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">cur. “That’s Lord Snow himself.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Bastard of Winterfell and brother to kings,” mocked Chett, who’d left his hounds to see </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="220" height="15" font="1">what the commotion was about. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That wolf’s looking at you hungry, girl,” Lark said. “Might be it fancies that tender bit </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">in your belly.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">Jon was not amused. “You’re scaring her.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Warning her, more like.” Chett’s grin was as ugly as the boils that covered most of his </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">face. </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="397" height="15" font="1">“We’re not to talk to you,” the girl remembered suddenly. </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“Wait,” Jon said, too late. She bolted, ran. </text>
<text top="492" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lark made a grab for the second rabbit, but Ghost was quicker. When he bared his teeth, </text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Sisterman slipped in the mud and went down on his bony butt. The others laughed. The </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="402" height="15" font="1">direwolf took the rabbit in his mouth and brought it to Jon. </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="346" height="15" font="1">“There was no call to scare the girl,” he told them. </text>
<text top="581" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“We’ll hear no scolds from you, bastard.” Chett blamed Jon for the loss of his </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">comfortable position with Maester Aemon, and not without justice. If he had not gone to </text>
<text top="620" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Aemon about Sam Tarly, Chett would still be tending an old blind man instead of a pack of </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ill-tempered hunting hounds. “You may be the Lord Commander’s pet, but you’re not the </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lord Commander . . . and you wouldn’t talk so bloody bold without that monster of yours </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">always about.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’ll not fight a brother while we’re beyond the Wall,” Jon answered, his voice cooler </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">than he felt. </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Lark got to one knee. “He’s afraid of you, Chett. On the Sisters, we have a name for them </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">like him.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I know all the names. Save your breath.” He walked away, Ghost at his side. The rain </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had dwindled to a thin drizzle by the time he reached the gate. Dusk would be on them soon, </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">followed by another wet dark dismal night. The clouds would hide moon and stars and </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mormont’s Torch, turning the woods black as pitch. Every piss would be an adventure, if not </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">quite of the sort Jon Snow had once envisioned. </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Out under the trees, some rangers had found enough duff and dry wood to start a fire </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beneath a slanting ridge of slate. Others had raised tents or made rude shelters by stretching </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their cloaks over low branches. Giant had crammed himself inside the hollow of a dead oak. </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">“How d’ye like my castle, Lord Snow?” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“It looks snug. You know where Sam is?” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Keep on the way you were. If you come on Ser Ottyn’s pavilion, you’ve gone too far.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="536" height="15" font="1">Giant smiled. “Unless Sam’s found him a tree too. What a tree that would be.” </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was Ghost who found Sam in the end. The direwolf shot ahead like a quarrel from a </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crossbow. Under an outcrop of rock that gave some small degree of shelter from the rain, Sam </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was feeding the ravens. His boots squished when he moved. “My feet are soaked through,” he </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">admitted miserably. “When I climbed off my horse, I stepped in a hole and went in up to my </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Take off your boots and dry your stockings. I’ll find some dry wood. If the ground’s not </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wet under the rock, we might be able to get a fire burning.” Jon showed Sam the rabbit. “And </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">we’ll feast.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">“Won’t you be attending Lord Mormont in the hall?” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No, but you will. The Old Bear wants you to map for him. Craster says he’ll find Mance </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">Rayder for us.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="530" height="15" font="1">“Oh.” Sam did not look anxious to meet Craster, even if it meant a warm fire. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He said eat first, though. Dry your feet.” Jon went to gather fuel, digging down under </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deadfalls for the drier wood beneath and peeling back layers of sodden pine needles until he </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">found likely kindling. Even then, it seemed to take forever for a spark to catch. He hung his </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">cloak from the rock to keep the rain off his smoky little fire, making them a small snug </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">alcove. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As he knelt to skin the rabbit, Sam pulled off his boots. “I think there’s moss growing </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">between my toes,” he declared mournfully, wriggling the toes in question. “The rabbit will </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">taste good. I don’t even mind about the blood and all.” He looked away. “Well, only a </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">little . . .” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon spitted the carcass, banked the fire with a pair of rocks, and balanced their meal atop </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">them. The rabbit had been a scrawny thing, but as it cooked it smelled like a king’s feast. </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Other rangers gave them envious looks. Even Ghost looked up hungrily, flames shining in his </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="456" height="15" font="1">red eyes as he sniffed. “You had yours before,” Jon reminded him. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Is Craster as savage as the rangers say?” Sam asked. The rabbit was a shade underdone, </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">but tasted wonderful. “What’s his castle like?” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A midden heap with a roof and a fire-pit.” Jon told Sam what he had seen and heard in </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="110" height="15" font="1">Craster’s Keep. </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">By the time the telling was done, it was dark outside and Sam was licking his fingers. </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“That was good, but now I’d like a leg of lamb. A whole leg, just for me, sauced with mint </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">and honey and cloves. Did you see any lambs?” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“There was a sheepfold, but no sheep.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="1">“How does he feed all his men?” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I didn’t see any men. Just Craster and his women and a few small girls. I wonder he’s </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">able to hold the place. His defenses were nothing to speak of, only a muddy dike. You had </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="456" height="15" font="1">better go up to the hall and draw that map. Can you find the way?” </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“If I don’t fall in the mud.” Sam struggled back into his boots, collected quill and </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">parchment, and shouldered out into the night, the rain pattering down on his cloak and floppy </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="29" height="15" font="1">hat. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ghost laid his head on his paws and went to sleep by the fire. Jon stretched out beside </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him, grateful for the warmth. He was cold and wet, but not so cold and wet as he’d been a </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">short time before. <i>Perhaps tonight the Old Bear will learn something that will lead us to </i></text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="5"><i>Uncle Benjen.</i> </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He woke to the sight of his own breath misting in the cold morning air. When he moved, </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his bones ached. Ghost was gone, the fire burnt out. Jon reached to pull aside the cloak he’d </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hung over the rock, and found it stiff and frozen. He crept beneath it and stood up in a forest </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">alike wore coats of glass. Even the mud puddles had a bright brown sheen. Through the </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>So there is magic beyond the Wall after all.</i> He found himself thinking of his sisters, </text>

<text top="444" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">king?” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A half-brother,” he admitted. “I’m Ned Stark’s bastard. My brother Robb is the King in </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">the North. Why are you here?” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The fat one, that Sam, he said to see you. He give me his cloak, so no one would say I </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">didn’t belong.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="250" height="15" font="1">“Won’t Craster be angry with you?” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My father drank overmuch of the Lord Crow’s wine last night. He’ll sleep most of the </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">day.” Her breath frosted the air in small nervous puffs. “They say the king gives justice and </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">protects the weak.” She started to climb off the rock, awkwardly, but the ice had made it </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">slippery and her foot went out from under her. Jon caught her before she could fall, and </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">helped her safely down. The woman knelt on the icy ground. “M’lord, I beg you—” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“Don’t beg me anything. Go back to your hall, you shouldn’t be here. We were </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">commanded not to speak to Craster’s women.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“You don’t have to speak with me, m’lord. Just take me with you, when you go, that’s all </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">I ask.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="5"><i>All she asks</i>, he thought. <i>As if that were nothing.</i> </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll . . . I’ll be your wife, if you like. My father, he’s got nineteen now, one less won’t </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">hurt him none.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Black brothers are sworn never to take wives, don’t you know that? And we’re guests in </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">your father’s hall besides.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Not  <i>you</i>,” she said. “I watched. You never ate at his board, nor slept by his fire. He </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="591" height="15" font="1">never gave you guest-right, so you’re not bound to him. It’s for the baby I have to go.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="223" height="15" font="1">“I don’t even know your name.” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“Gilly, he called me. For the gillyflower.” </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That’s pretty.” He remembered Sansa telling him once that he should say that whenever </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a lady told him her name. He could not help the girl, but perhaps the courtesy would please </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">her. “Is it Craster who frightens you, Gilly?” </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“For the baby, not for me. If it’s a girl, that’s not so bad, she’ll grow a few years and he’ll </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">marry her. But Nella says it’s to be a boy, and she’s had six and knows these things. He gives </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">why he started giving them sheep, even though he has a taste for mutton. Only now the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="620" height="15" font="1">sheep’s gone too. Next it will be dogs, till . . .” She lowered her eyes and stroked her belly. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What gods?” Jon was remembering that they’d seen no boys in Craster’s Keep, nor men </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="1">either, save Craster himself. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="488" height="15" font="1">“The cold gods,” she said. “The ones in the night. The white shadows.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And suddenly Jon was back in the Lord Commander’s Tower again. A severed hand was </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">climbing his calf and when he pried it off with the point of his longsword, it lay writhing, </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fingers opening and closing. The dead man rose to his feet, blue eyes shining in that gashed </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and swollen face. Ropes of torn flesh hung from the great wound in his belly, yet there was no </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">blood. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="290" height="15" font="1">“What color are their eyes?” he asked her. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">“Blue. As bright as blue stars, and as cold.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="5"><i>She has seen them</i>, he thought. <i>Craster lied.</i> </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“Will you take me? Just so far as the Wall—” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We do not ride for the Wall. We ride north, after Mance Rayder and these Others, these </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="634" height="15" font="1">white shadows and their wights. We <i>seek</i> them, Gilly. Your babe would not be safe with us.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her fear was plain on her face. “You will come back, though. When your warring’s done, </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">you’ll pass this way again.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We may.” <i>If any of us still live.</i> “That’s for the Old Bear to say, the one you call the </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">Lord Crow. I’m only his squire. I do not choose the road I ride.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“No.” He could hear the defeat in her voice. “Sorry to be of trouble, m’lord. I </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only . . . they said the king keeps people safe, and I thought . . .” Despairing, she ran, Sam’s </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="335" height="15" font="1">cloak flapping behind her like great black wings. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon watched her go, his joy in the morning’s brittle beauty gone. <i>Damn her</i>, he thought </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">resentfully, <i>and damn Sam twice for sending her to me. What did he think I could do for her? </i></text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="5"><i>We’re here to fight wildlings, not save them.</i> </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Other men were crawling from their shelters, yawning and stretching. The magic was </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">already faded, icy brightness turning back to common dew in the light of the rising sun. </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Someone had gotten a fire started; he could smell woodsmoke drifting through the trees, and </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the smoky scent of bacon. Jon took down his cloak and snapped it against the rock, shattering </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the thin crust of ice that had formed in the night, then gathered up Longclaw and shrugged an </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">arm through a shoulder strap. A few yards away he made water into a frozen bush, his piss </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">steaming in the cold air and melting the ice wherever it fell. Afterward he laced up his black </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="271" height="15" font="1">wool breeches and followed the smells. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Grenn and Dywen were among the brothers who had gathered round the fire. Hake </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">handed Jon a hollow heel of bread filled with burnt bacon and chunks of salt fish warmed in </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bacon grease. He wolfed it down while listening to Dywen boast of having three of Craster’s </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">women during the night. </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="403" height="15" font="1">“You did not,” Grenn said, scowling. “I would have seen.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Dywen whapped him up alongside his ear with the back of his hand. “You? Seen? </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">You’re blind as Maester Aemon. You never even saw that bear.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="222" height="15" font="1">“What bear? Was there a bear?” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There’s always a bear,” declared Dolorous Edd in his usual tone of gloomy resignation. </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“One killed my brother when I was young. Afterward it wore his teeth around its neck on a </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">with my teeth.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“Did Sam sleep in the hall last night?” Jon asked him. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’d not call it sleeping. The ground was hard, the rushes ill-smelling, and my brothers </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">snore frightfully. Speak of bears if you will, none ever growled so fierce as Brown Bernarr. I </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was warm, though. Some dogs crawled atop me during the night. My cloak was almost dry </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when one of them pissed in it. Or perhaps it was Brown Bernarr. Have you noticed that the </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rain stopped the instant I had a roof above me? It will start again now that I’m back out. Gods </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="259" height="15" font="1">and dogs alike delight to piss on me.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“I’d best go see to Lord Mormont,” said Jon. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The rain might have stopped, but the compound was still a morass of shallow lakes and </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slippery mud. Black brothers were folding their tents, feeding their horses, and chewing on </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">strips of salt beef. Jarman Buckwell’s scouts were tightening the girths on their saddles before </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">setting out. “Jon,” Buckwell greeted him from horseback. “Keep a good edge on that bastard </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="347" height="15" font="1">sword of yours. We’ll be needing it soon enough.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Craster’s hall was dim after daylight. Inside, the night’s torches had burned low, and it </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was hard to know that the sun had risen. Lord Mormont’s raven was the first to spy him enter. </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Three lazy flaps of its great black wings, and it perched atop Longclaw’s hilt. “<i>Corn?</i>” It </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="217" height="15" font="1">nipped at a strand of Jon’s hair. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ignore that wretched beggar bird, Jon, it’s just had half my bacon.” The Old Bear sat at </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Craster’s board, breaking his fast with the other officers on fried bread, bacon, and sheepgut </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sausage. Craster’s new axe was on the table, its gold inlay gleaming faintly in the torchlight. </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Its owner was sprawled unconscious in the sleeping loft above, but the women were all up, </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">moving about and serving. “What sort of day do we have?” </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="226" height="15" font="1">“Cold, but the rain has stopped.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Very good. See that my horse is saddled and ready. I mean for us to ride within the </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">hour. Have you eaten? Craster serves plain fare, but filling.” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I will not eat Craster’s food</i>, he decided suddenly. “I broke my fast with the men, my </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">lord.” Jon shooed the raven off Longclaw. The bird hopped back to Mormont’s shoulder, </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">where it promptly shat. “You might have done that on Snow instead of saving it for me,” the </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="276" height="15" font="1">Old Bear grumbled. The raven <i>quorked</i>. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He found Sam behind the hall, standing with Gilly at the broken rabbit hutch. She was </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">helping him back into his cloak, but when she saw Jon she stole away. Sam gave him a look </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="373" height="15" font="1">of wounded reproach. “I thought you would help her.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And how was I to do that?” Jon said sharply. “Take her with us, wrapped up in your </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">cloak? We were commanded not to—” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I know,” said Sam guiltily, “but she was afraid. I know what it is to be afraid. I told </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">her . . .” He swallowed. </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="256" height="15" font="1">“<i>What?</i> That we’d take her with us?” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sam’s fat face blushed a deep red. “On the way home.” He could not meet Jon’s eyes. </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">“She’s going to have a baby.” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Sam, have you taken leave of all your sense? We may not even return this way. And if </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="588" height="15" font="1">we do, do you think the Old Bear is going to let you pack off one of Craster’s wives?” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">“I thought . . . maybe by then I could think of a way . . .” </text>
</page>
<page number="200" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I have no time for this, I have horses to groom and saddle.” Jon walked away as </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">confused as he was angry. Sam’s heart was a big as the rest of him, but for all his reading he </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could be as thick as Grenn at times. It was impossible, and dishonorable besides. <i>So why do I </i></text>
<text top="163" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="5"><i>feel so ashamed?</i> </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon took his accustomed position at Mormont’s side as the Night’s Watch streamed out </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">past the skulls on Craster’s gate. They struck off north and west along a crooked game trail. </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Melting ice dripped down all about them, a slower sort of rain with its own soft music. North </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the compound, the brook was in full spate, choked with leaves and bits of wood, but the </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scouts had found where the ford lay and the column was able to splash across. The water ran </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as high as a horse’s belly. Ghost swam, emerging on the bank with his white fur dripping </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brown. When he shook, spraying mud and water in all directions, Mormont said nothing, but </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="250" height="15" font="1">on his shoulder the raven screeched. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My lord,” Jon said quietly as the wood closed in around them once more. “Craster has </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">no sheep. Nor any sons.” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="187" height="15" font="1">Mormont made no answer. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“At Winterfell one of the serving women told us stories,” Jon went on. “She used to say </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="593" height="15" font="1">that there were wildlings who would lay with the Others to birth half-human children.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="404" height="15" font="1">“Hearth tales. Does Craster seem less than human to you?” </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="5"><i>In half a hundred ways.</i> “He gives his sons to the wood.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="588" height="15" font="1">A long silence. Then: “Yes.” And “<i>Yes</i>,” the raven muttered, strutting. “<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="97" height="15" font="1">“You knew?” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="557" height="15" font="1">“Smallwood told me. Long ago. All the rangers know, though few will talk of it.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="161" height="15" font="1">“Did my uncle know?” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“All the rangers,” Mormont repeated. “You think I ought to stop him. Kill him if need </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">be.” The Old Bear sighed. “Were it only that he wished to rid himself of some mouths, I’d </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gladly send Yoren or Conwys to collect the boys. We could raise them to the black and the </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Watch would be that much the stronger. But the wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">These boys are Craster’s offerings. His prayers, if you will.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="352" height="15" font="5"><i>His wives must offer different prayers</i>, Jon thought. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“How is it you came to know this?” the Old Bear asked him. “From one of Craster’s </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">wives?” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lord,” Jon confessed. “I would sooner not tell you which. She was frightened </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">and wanted help.” </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Craster is his own man. He has sworn us no vows. Nor is he subject to our laws. Your </text>

<text top="360" left="171" width="237" height="15" font="1">“Is he making a city, or an army?” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Now, that is the question. How many wildlings are there? How many men of fighting </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">age? No one knows with certainty. The Frostfangs are cruel, inhospitable, a wilderness of </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stone and ice. They will not long sustain any great number of people. I can see only one </text>

<text top="469" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Wildlings have invaded the realm before.” Jon had heard the tales from Old Nan and </text>

<text top="695" left="171" width="214" height="15" font="1">“What will we do?” asked Jon. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">“Find him,” said Mormont. “Fight him. Stop him.” </text>

<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon turned to give her an appraising glance. He liked what he saw. Ironborn, he knew </text>

<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hands, a dirk at her belt. Her nose was too big and too sharp for her thin face, but her smile </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">made up for it. He judged her a few years older than he was, but no more than five-and-</text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="449" height="15" font="1">twenty. She moved as if she were used to a deck beneath her feet. </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="503" height="15" font="1">“Yes, she’s a sweet sight,” he told her, “though not half so sweet as you.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="536" height="15" font="1">“Oho.” She grinned. “I’d best be careful. This lordling has a honeyed tongue.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Is it that way, then?” she said, eyeing him boldly. There were women on the Iron </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Islands—not many, but a few—who crewed the longships along with their men, and it was </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="258" height="15" font="1">“Women enough, but none like you.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="303" height="15" font="1">“And how would you know what I’m like?” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“My eyes can see your face. My ears can hear your laughter. And my cock’s gone hard as </text>

<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The woman stepped close and pressed a hand to the front of his breeches. “Well, you’re </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="563" height="15" font="1">no liar,” she said, giving him a squeeze through the cloth. “How bad does it hurt?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="79" height="15" font="1">“Fiercely.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Poor lordling.” She released him and stepped back. “As it happens, I’m a woman wed, </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="146" height="15" font="1">and new with child.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="542" height="15" font="1">“The gods are good,” Theon said. “No chance I’d give you a bastard that way.” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">“Even so, my man wouldn’t thank you.” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="148" height="15" font="1">“No, but you might.” </text>
<text top="472" left="171" width="594" height="15" font="1">“And why would that be? I’ve had lords before. They’re made the same as other men.” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Have you ever had a prince?” he asked her. “When you’re wrinkled and grey and your </text>
<text top="517" left="139" width="627" height="15" font="1">teats hang past your belly, you can tell your children’s children that once you loved a king.” </text>
<text top="542" left="171" width="563" height="15" font="1">“Oh, is it love we’re talking now? And here I thought it was just cocks and cunts.” </text>
<text top="567" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Is it love you fancy?” He’d decided that he liked this wench, whoever she was; her </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sharp wit was a welcome respite from the damp gloom of Pyke. “Shall I name my longship </text>
<text top="606" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">after you, and play you the high harp, and keep you in a tower room in my castle with only </text>

<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You <i>ought</i> to name your ship after me,” she said, ignoring all the rest. “It was me who </text>
<text top="670" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">built her.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“Sigrin built her. My lord father’s shipwright.” </text>

<text top="745" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He had not known that Ambrode had a daughter, or Sigrin a wife . . . but he’d met the </text>

<text top="809" left="171" width="380" height="15" font="1">“Oho. Sigrin told me this sweet ship is wasted on you.” </text>
<text top="835" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">Theon bristled. “Do you know who I am?” </text>
<text top="860" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Prince Theon of House Greyjoy. Who else? Tell me true, my lord, how well do you love </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">her, this new maid of yours? Sigrin will want to know.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The longship was so new that she still smelled of pitch and resin. His uncle Aeron would </text>
<text top="924" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bless her on the morrow, but Theon had ridden over from Pyke to get a look at her before she </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">was launched. She was not so large as Lord Balon’s own <i>Great Kraken</i> or his uncle </text>
<text top="963" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Victarion’s <i>Iron Victory</i>, but she looked swift and sweet, even sitting in her wooden cradle on </text>
<text top="982" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the strand; lean black hull a hundred feet long, a single tall mast, fifty long oars, deck enough </text>
<text top="1002" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">for a hundred men . . . and at the prow, the great iron ram in the shape of an arrowhead. </text>
<text top="1021" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">“Sigrin did me good service,” he admitted. “Is she as fast as she looks?” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“Faster—for a master that knows how to handle her.” </text>

<text top="199" left="171" width="398" height="15" font="1">“Fair maiden?” She laughed. “She’s a sea bitch, this one.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="329" height="15" font="1">“There, and now you’ve named her. <i>Sea Bitch</i>.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">That amused her; he could see the sparkle in her dark eyes. “And you said you’d name </text>

<text top="701" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Come back to Pyke with me,” he said suddenly, thinking, <i>What will Lord Balon say? </i></text>

<text top="809" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">waited for the last stragglers to arrive, but Theon saw no need to tell all that. </text>
<text top="835" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Would you make me your captain for the night, my lord prince?” She had the wickedest </text>

<text top="879" left="171" width="342" height="15" font="1">“I might. If I knew you’d steer me safe into port.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, I know which end of the oar goes in the sea, and there’s no one better with ropes </text>

<text top="447" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that lined the pebbled shore and rode at anchor well out past the breakwater. Ironmen did not </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bend their knees often nor easily, but Theon noted that oarsmen and townfolk alike grew quiet </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as they passed, and acknowledged him with respectful bows of the head. <i>They have finally </i></text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="335" height="15" font="5"><i>learned who I am</i>, he thought. <i>And past time too.</i> </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lord Goodbrother of Great Wyk had come in the night before with his main strength, </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">near forty longships. His men were everywhere, conspicuous in their striped goat’s-hair </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sashes. It was said about the inn that Otter Gimpknee’s whores were being fucked bowlegged </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by beardless boys in sashes. The boys were welcome to them so far as Theon was concerned. </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">A poxier den of slatterns he hoped he’d never see. His present companion was more to his </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">taste. That she was wed to his father’s shipwright and pregnant to boot only made her more </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="75" height="15" font="1">intriguing. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Has my lord prince begun choosing his crew?” Esgred asked as they made their way </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">toward the stable. “Ho, Bluetooth,” she shouted to a passing seafarer, a tall man in bearskin </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="371" height="15" font="1">vest and raven-winged helm. “How fares your bride?” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="261" height="15" font="1">“Fat with child, and talking of twins.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="588" height="15" font="1">“So soon?” Esgred smiled that wicked smile. “You got your oar in the water quickly.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="414" height="15" font="1">“Aye, and stroked and stroked and <i>stroked</i>,” roared the man. </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“A big man,” Theon observed. “Bluetooth, was it? Should I choose him for my <i>Sea </i></text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="5"><i>Bitch?</i>” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="497" height="15" font="1">“Only if you mean to insult him. Bluetooth has a sweet ship of his own.” </text>
<text top="882" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I have been too long away to know one man from another,” Theon admitted. He’d </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">looked for a few of the friends he’d played with as a boy, but they were gone, dead, or grown </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">into strangers. “My uncle Victarion has loaned me his own steersman.” </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Rymolf Stormdrunk? A good man, so long as he’s sober.” She saw more faces she </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">knew, and called out to a passing trio, “Uller, Qarl. Where’s your brother, Skyte?” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The Drowned God needed a strong oarsman, I fear,” replied the stocky man with the </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">white streak in his beard. </text>
<text top="1035" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“What he means is, Eldiss drank too much wine and his fat belly burst,” said the pink-</text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">cheeked youth beside him. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="296" height="15" font="1">“What’s dead may never die,” Esgred said. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="209" height="15" font="1">“What’s dead may never die.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Theon muttered the words with them. “You seem well known,” he said to the woman </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">when the men had passed on. </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Every man loves the shipwright’s wife. He had better, lest he wants his ship to sink. If </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">you need men to pull your oars, you could do worse than those three.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lordsport has no lack of strong arms.” Theon had given the matter no little thought. It </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was fighters he wanted, and men who would be loyal to <i>him</i>, not to his lord father or his </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">uncles. He was playing the part of a dutiful young prince for the moment, while he waited for </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon to reveal the fullness of his plans. If it turned out that he did not like those plans </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">or his part in them, however, well . . . </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Strength is not enough. A longship’s oars must move as one if you would have her best </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">speed. Choose men who have rowed together before, if you’re wise.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Sage counsel. Perhaps you’d help me choose them.” <i>Let her believe I want her wisdom, </i></text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="128" height="15" font="5"><i>women fancy that.</i> </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="219" height="15" font="1">“I may. If you treat me kindly.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="90" height="15" font="1">“How else?” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon quickened his stride as they neared the <i>Myraham</i>, rocking high and empty by the </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">quay. Her captain had tried to sail a fortnight past, but Lord Balon would not permit it. None </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of the merchantmen that called at Lordsport had been allowed to depart again; his father </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="565" height="15" font="1">wanted no word of the hosting to reach the mainland before he was ready to strike. </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Milord,” a plaintive voice called down from the forecastle of the merchanter. The </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">captain’s daughter leaned over the rail, gazing after him. Her father had forbidden her to come </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ashore, but whenever Theon came to Lordsport he spied her wandering forlornly about the </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">deck. “Milord, a moment,” she called after him. “As it please milord . . .” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="527" height="15" font="1">“Did she?” Esgred asked as Theon hurried her past the cog. “Please milord?” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He saw no sense in being coy with this one. “For a time. Now she wants to be my salt </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">wife.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oho. Well, she’d profit from some salting, no doubt. Too soft and bland, that one. Or </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="97" height="15" font="1">am I wrong?” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="473" height="15" font="1">“You’re not wrong.” <i>Soft and bland. Precisely. How had she known?</i> </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He had told Wex to wait at the inn. The common room was so crowded that Theon had to </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">push his way through the door. Not a seat was to be had at bench nor table. Nor did he see his </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">squire. “Wex,” he shouted over the din and clatter. <i>If he’s up with one of those poxy whores, </i></text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>I’ll strip the hide off him</i>, he was thinking when he finally spied the boy, dicing near the </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">hearth . . . and winning too, by the look of the pile of coins before him. </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Time to go,” Theon announced. When the boy paid him no mind, he seized him by the </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">ear and pulled him from the game. Wex grabbed up a fistful of coppers and came along </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">without a word. That was one of the things Theon liked best about him. Most squires have </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">loose tongues, but Wex had been born dumb . . . which didn’t seem to keep him from being </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">clever as any twelve-year-old had a right to be. He was a baseborn son of one of Lord </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Botley’s half brothers. Taking him as squire had been part of the price Theon had paid for his </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">horse. </text>
</page>
<page number="206" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When Wex saw Esgred, his eyes went round. <i>You’d think he’d never seen a woman </i></text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>before</i>, Theon thought. “Esgred will be riding with me back to Pyke. Saddle the horses, and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="129" height="15" font="1">be quick about it.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The boy had ridden in on a scrawny little garron from Lord Balon’s stable, but Theon’s </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mount was quite another sort of beast. “Where did you find that hellhorse?” Esgred asked </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="534" height="15" font="1">when she saw him, but from the way she laughed he knew she was impressed. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lord Botley bought him in Lannisport a year past, but he proved to be too much horse </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">for him, so Botley was pleased to sell.” The Iron Islands were too sparse and rocky for </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">breeding good horses. Most of the islanders were indifferent riders at best, more comfortable </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on the deck of a longship than in the saddle. Even the lords rode garrons or shaggy Harlaw </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ponies, and ox carts were more common than drays. The smallfolk too poor to own either one </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">pulled their own plows through the thin, stony soil. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But Theon had spent ten years in Winterfell, and did not intend to go to war without a </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">good mount beneath him. Lord Botley’s misjudgment was his good fortune: a stallion with a </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">temper as black as his hide, larger than a courser if not quite so big as most destriers. As </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon was not quite so big as most knights, that suited him admirably. The animal had fire in </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">his eyes. When he’d met his new owner, he’d pulled back his lips and tried to bite off his face. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="419" height="15" font="1">“Does he have a name?” Esgred asked Theon as he mounted. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Smiler.” He gave her a hand, and pulled her up in front of him, where he could put his </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">arms around her as they rode. “I knew a man once who told me that I smiled at the wrong </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">things.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="77" height="15" font="1">“Do you?” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Only by the lights of those who smile at nothing.” He thought of his father and his uncle </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">Aeron. </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“Are you smiling now, my lord prince?” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh, yes.” Theon reached around her to take the reins. She was almost of a height with </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him. Her hair could have used a wash and she had a faded pink scar on her pretty neck, but he </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="339" height="15" font="1">liked the smell of her, salt and sweat and woman. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The ride back to Pyke promised to be a good deal more interesting than the ride down </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">had been. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When they were well beyond Lordsport, Theon put a hand on her breast. Esgred reached </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up and plucked it away. “I’d keep both hands on the reins, or this black beast of yours is like </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">to fling us both off and kick us to death.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I broke him of that.” Amused, Theon behaved himself for a while, chatting amiably of </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the weather (grey and overcast, as it had been since he arrived, with frequent rains) and telling </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her of the men he’d killed in the Whispering Wood. When he reached the part about coming </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>that</i> close to the Kingslayer himself, he slid his hand back up to where it had been. Her breasts </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">were small, but he liked the firmness of them. </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="306" height="15" font="1">“You don’t want to do that, my lord prince.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“Oh, but I do.” Theon gave her a squeeze. </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“Your squire is watching you.” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">“Let him. He’ll never speak of it, I swear.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Esgred pried his fingers off her breast. This time she kept him firmly prisoned. She had </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">strong hands. </text>
<text top="1063" left="171" width="276" height="15" font="1">“I like a woman with a good tight grip.” </text>
</page>
<page number="207" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="487" height="15" font="1">She snorted. “I’d not have thought it, by that wench on the waterfront.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="486" height="15" font="1">“You must not judge me by her. She was the only woman on the ship.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="457" height="15" font="1">“Tell me of your father. Will he welcome me kindly to his castle?” </text>
<text top="180" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why should he? He scarcely welcomed <i>me</i>, his own blood, the heir to Pyke and the Iron </text>
<text top="199" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">Islands.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="544" height="15" font="1">“Are you?” she asked mildly. “It’s said that you have uncles, brothers, a sister.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My brothers are long dead, and my sister . . . well, they say Asha’s favorite gown is a </text>
<text top="269" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chain-mail hauberk that hangs down past her knees, with boiled leather smallclothes beneath. </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Men’s garb won’t make her a man, though. I’ll make a good marriage alliance with her once </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">we’ve won the war, if I can find a man to take her. As I recall, she had a nose like a vulture’s </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="412" height="15" font="1">beak, a ripe crop of pimples, and no more chest than a boy.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="499" height="15" font="1">“You can marry off your sister,” Esgred observed, “but not your uncles.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My uncles . . .” Theon’s claim took precedence over those of his father’s three brothers, </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but the woman had touched on a sore point nonetheless. In the islands it was scarce unheard </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of for a strong, ambitious uncle to dispossess a weak nephew of his rights, and usually murder </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him in the bargain. <i>But I am not weak</i>, Theon told himself, <i>and I mean to be stronger yet by </i></text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>the time my father dies.</i> “My uncles pose no threat to me,” he declared. “Aeron is drunk on </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">seawater and sanctity. He lives only for his god—” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="159" height="15" font="1">“<i>His</i> god? Not yours?” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Mine as well. What is dead can never die.” He smiled thinly. “If I make pious noises as </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="496" height="15" font="1">required, Damphair will give me no trouble. And my uncle Victarion—” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet, and a fearsome warrior. I have heard them sing of him in </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">the alehouses.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“During my lord father’s rebellion, he sailed into Lannisport with my uncle Euron and </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">burned the Lannister fleet where it lay at anchor,” Theon recalled. “The plan was Euron’s, </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though. Victarion is like some great grey bullock, strong and tireless and dutiful, but not like </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to win any races. No doubt, he’ll serve me as loyally as he has served my lord father. He has </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="344" height="15" font="1">neither the wits nor the ambition to plot betrayal.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Euron Croweye has no lack of cunning, though. I’ve heard men say terrible things of </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">that one.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon shifted his seat. “My uncle Euron has not been seen in the islands for close on two </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">years. He may be dead.” If so, it might be for the best. Lord Balon’s eldest brother had never </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">given up the Old Way, even for a day. His <i>Silence</i>, with its black sails and dark red hull, was </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="390" height="15" font="1">infamous in every port from Ibben to Asshai, it was said. </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He may be dead,” Esgred agreed, “and if he lives, why, he has spent so long at sea, he’d </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">be half a stranger here. The ironborn would never seat a stranger in the Seastone Chair.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I suppose not,” Theon replied, before it occurred to him that some would call him a </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stranger as well. The thought made him frown. <i>Ten years is a long while, but I am back now, </i></text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="5"><i>and my father is far from dead. I have time to prove myself.</i> </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He considered fondling Esgred’s breast again, but she would probably only take his hand </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">away, and all this talk of his uncles had dampened his ardor somewhat. Time enough for such </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">play at the castle, in the privacy of his chambers. “I will speak to Helya when we reach Pyke, </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and see that you have an honored place at the feast,” he said. “I must sit on the dais, at my </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">father’s right hand, but I will come down and join you when he leaves the hall. He seldom </text>

<text top="224" left="171" width="571" height="15" font="1">“What shall I wear to this great feast?” She reached back and pushed his face away. </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’ll ask Helya to garb you. One of my lady mother’s gowns might do. She is off on </text>

<text top="338" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Would that I could. I am kept too busy here. My father relies on me, now that I am </text>

<text top="383" left="171" width="267" height="15" font="1">“Your coming might bring <i>her</i> peace.” </text>
<text top="408" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">“Now you sound a woman,” Theon complained. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="282" height="15" font="1">“I confess, I am . . . and new with child.” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Somehow that thought excited him. “So you say, but your body shows no signs of it. </text>
<text top="478" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">How shall it be proven? Before I believe you, I shall need to see your breasts grow ripe, and </text>

<text top="522" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">“And what will my husband say to this? Your father’s own sworn man and servant?” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="515" height="15" font="1">“We’ll give him so many ships to build, he’ll never know you’ve left him.” </text>
<text top="573" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She laughed. “It’s a cruel lordling who’s seized me. If I promise you that one day you </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">may watch my babe get suck, will you tell me more of your war, Theon of House Greyjoy? </text>
<text top="612" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">There are miles and mountains still ahead of us, and I would hear of this wolf king you </text>
<text top="631" left="139" width="269" height="15" font="1">served, and the golden lions he fights.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ever anxious to please her, Theon obliged. The rest of the long ride passed swiftly as he </text>
<text top="676" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">filled her pretty head with tales of Winterfell and war. Some of the things he said astonished </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. <i>She is easy to talk to, gods praise her</i>, he reflected. <i>I feel as though I’ve known her for </i></text>
<text top="715" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>years. If the wench’s pillow play is half the equal of her wit, I’ll need to keep her . . .</i> He </text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">thought of Sigrin the Shipwright, a thick-bodied, thick-witted man, flaxen hair already </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="556" height="15" font="1">receding from a pimpled brow, and shook his head. <i>A waste. A most tragic waste.</i> </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It seemed scarcely any time at all before the great curtain wall of Pyke loomed up before </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">them. </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The gates were open. Theon put his heels into Smiler and rode through at a brisk trot. </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The hounds were barking wildly as he helped Esgred dismount. Several came bounding up, </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tails wagging. They shot straight past him and almost bowled the woman over, leaping all </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">around her, yapping and licking. “<i>Off</i>,” Theon shouted, aiming an ineffectual kick at one big </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">brown bitch, but Esgred was laughing and wrestling with them. </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A stableman came pounding up after the dogs. “Take the horse,” Theon commanded him, </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="243" height="15" font="1">“and get these damn dogs away—” </text>
<text top="971" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The lout paid him no mind. His face broke into a huge gap-toothed smile and he said, </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">“Lady Asha. You’re back.” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Last night,” she said. “I sailed from Great Wyk with Lord Goodbrother, and spent the </text>
<text top="1035" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">night at the inn. My little brother was kind enough to let me ride with him from Lordsport.” </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">She kissed one of the dogs on the nose and grinned at Theon. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">All he could do was stand and gape at her. <i>Asha. No. She cannot be Asha.</i> He realized </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">suddenly that there were two Ashas in his head. One was the little girl he had known. The </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">other, more vaguely imagined, looked something like her mother. Neither looked a bit like </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The pimples went when the breasts came,” she explained while she tussled with a dog, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">“but I kept the vulture’s beak.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="341" height="15" font="1">Theon found his voice. “<i>Why didn’t you tell me?</i>” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Asha let go of the hound and straightened. “I wanted to see who you were first. And I </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">did.” She gave him a mocking half bow. “And now, little brother, pray excuse me. I need to </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bathe and dress for the feast. I wonder if I still have that chain-mail gown I like to wear over </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">my boiled leather smallclothes?” She gave him that evil grin, and crossed the bridge with that </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="353" height="15" font="1">walk he’d liked so well, half saunter and half sway. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When Theon turned away, Wex was smirking at him. He gave the boy a clout on the ear. </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“That’s for enjoying this so much.” And another, harder. “And that’s for not warning me. </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">Next time, grow a tongue.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His own chambers in the Guest Keep had never seemed so chilly, though the thralls had </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">left a brazier burning. Theon kicked his boots off, let his cloak fall to the floor, and poured </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself a cup of wine, remembering a gawky girl with knob knees and pimples. <i>She unlaced </i></text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>my breeches</i>, he thought, outraged, <i>and she said . . . oh, gods, and</i> I <i>said . . .</i> He groaned. He </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">could not possibly have made a more appalling fool of himself. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>No</i>, he thought then. <i>She was the one who made me a fool. The evil bitch must have </i></text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="5"><i>enjoyed every moment of it. And the way she kept reaching for my cock . . .</i> </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He took his cup and went to the window seat, where he sat drinking and watching the sea </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">while the sun darkened over Pyke. <i>I have no place here</i>, he thought, <i>and Asha is the reason, </i></text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>may the Others take her!</i> The water below turned from green to grey to black. By then he </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">could hear distant music, and he knew it was time to change for the feast. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon chose plain boots and plainer clothes, somber shades of black and grey to fit his </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mood. No ornament; he had nothing bought with iron. <i>I might have taken something off that </i></text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>wildling I killed to save Bran Stark, but he had nothing worth the taking. That’s my cursed </i></text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="138" height="15" font="5"><i>luck, I kill the poor.</i> </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The long smoky hall was crowded with his father’s lords and captains when Theon </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">entered, near four hundred of them. Dagmer Cleftjaw had not yet returned from Old Wyk with </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Stonehouses and Drumms, but all the rest were there—Harlaws from Harlaw, Blacktydes </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">from Blacktyde, Sparrs, Merlyns, and Goodbrothers from Great Wyk, Saltcliffes and </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sunderlies from Saltcliffe, and Botleys and Wynches from the other side of Pyke. The thralls </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were pouring ale, and there was music, fiddles and skins and drums. Three burly men were </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">doing the finger dance, spinning short-hafted axes at each other. The trick was to catch the </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">axe or leap over it without missing a step. It was called the finger dance because it usually </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="402" height="15" font="1">ended when one of the dancers lost one . . . or two, or five. </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Neither the dancers nor the drinkers took much note of Theon Greyjoy as he strode to the </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dais. Lord Balon occupied the Seastone Chair, carved in the shape of a great kraken from an </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">immense block of oily black stone. Legend said that the First Men had found it standing on </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the shore of Old Wyk when they came to the Iron Islands. To the left of the high seat were </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon’s uncles. Asha was ensconced at his right hand, in the place of honor. “You come late, </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="211" height="15" font="1">Theon,” Lord Balon observed. </text>
<text top="1042" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I ask your pardon.” Theon took the empty seat beside Asha. Leaning close, he hissed in </text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">her ear, “You’re in my place.” </text>
</page>
<page number="210" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She turned to him with innocent eyes. “Brother, surely you are mistaken. Your place is at </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Winterfell.” Her smile cut. “And where are all your pretty clothes? I heard you fancied silk </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and velvet against your skin.” She was in soft green wool herself, simply cut, the fabric </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">clinging to the slender lines of her body. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your hauberk must have rusted away, sister,” he threw back. “A great pity. I’d like to </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">see you all in iron.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Asha only laughed. “You may yet, little brother . . . if you think your <i>Sea Bitch</i> can keep </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">up with my <i>Black Wind</i>.” One of their father’s thralls came near, bearing a flagon of wine. </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Are you drinking ale or wine tonight, Theon?” She leaned over close. “Or is it still a taste of </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="233" height="15" font="1">my mother’s milk you thirst for?” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He flushed. “Wine,” he told the thrall. Asha turned away and banged on the table, </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">shouting for ale. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon hacked a loaf of bread in half, hollowed out a trencher, and summoned a cook to </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fill it with fish stew. The smell of the thick cream made him a little ill, but he forced himself </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to eat some. He’d drunk enough wine to float him through two meals. <i>If I retch, it will be on </i></text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="552" height="15" font="5"><i>her.</i> “Does Father know that you’ve married his shipwright?” he asked his sister. </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No more than Sigrin does.” She gave a shrug. “<i>Esgred</i> was the first ship he built. He </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="552" height="15" font="1">named her after his mother. I would be hard-pressed to say which he loves best.” </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="282" height="15" font="1">“Every word you spoke to me was a lie.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="550" height="15" font="1">“Not <i>every</i> word. Remember when I told you I like to be on top?” Asha grinned. </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">That only made him angrier. “All that about being a woman wed, and new with </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="71" height="15" font="1">child . . .” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Oh, that part was true enough.” Asha leapt to her feet. “<i>Rolfe, here</i>,” she shouted down </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at one of the finger dancers, holding up a hand. He saw her, spun, and suddenly an axe came </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flying from his hand, the blade gleaming as it tumbled end over end through the torchlight. </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon had time for a choked gasp before Asha snatched the axe from the air and slammed it </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">down into the table, splitting his trencher in two and splattering his mantle with drippings. </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“There’s my lord husband.” His sister reached down inside her gown and drew a dirk from </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="1">between her breasts. “And here’s my sweet suckling babe.” </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He could not imagine how he looked at that moment, but suddenly Theon Greyjoy </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">realized that the Great Hall was ringing with laughter, all of it at him. Even his father was </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smiling, gods be damned, and his uncle Victarion chuckled aloud. The best response he could </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="583" height="15" font="1">summon was a queasy grin. <i>We shall see who is laughing when all this is done, bitch.</i> </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Asha wrenched the axe out of the table and flung it back down at the dancers, to whistles </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and loud cheers. “You’d do well to heed what I told you about choosing a crew.” A thrall </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">offered them a platter, and she stabbed a salted fish and ate it off the end of her dirk. “If you </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had troubled to learn the first thing of Sigrin, I could never have fooled you. Ten years a wolf, </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and you land here and think to prince about the islands, but you know nothing and no one. </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">Why should men fight and die for you?” </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">“I am their lawful prince,” Theon said stiffly. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“By the laws of the green lands, you might be. But we make our own laws here, or have </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">you forgotten?” </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Scowling, Theon turned to contemplate the leaking trencher before him. He would have </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stew in his lap before long. He shouted for a thrall to clean it up. <i>Half my life I have waited to </i></text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>come home, and for what? Mockery and disregard?</i> This was not the Pyke he remembered. </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="595" height="15" font="1">Or <i>did</i> he remember? He had been so young when they took him away to hold hostage. </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">to flow well after the last of the courses had been cleared away. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon Greyjoy rose from the Seastone Chair. “Have done with your drink and come </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to my solar,” he commanded his companions on the dais. “We have plans to lay.” He left </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them with no other word, flanked by two of his guards. His brothers followed in short order. </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="196" height="15" font="1">Theon rose to go after them. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My little brother is in a rush to be off.” Asha raised her drinking horn and beckoned for </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">more ale. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">“Our lord father is waiting.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And has, for many a year. It will do him no harm to wait a little longer . . . but if you </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fear his wrath, scurry after him by all means. You ought to have no trouble catching our </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">uncles.” She smiled. “One is drunk on seawater, after all, and the other is a great grey bullock </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">so dim he’ll probably get lost.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">Theon sat back down, annoyed. “I run after no man.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“No man, but every woman?” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“It was not me who grabbed your cock.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="553" height="15" font="1">“I don’t have one, remember? You grabbed every other bit of me quick enough.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He could feel the flush creeping up his cheeks. “I’m a man with a man’s hungers. What </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">sort of unnatural creature are you?” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Only a shy maid.” Asha’s hand darted out under the table to give his cock a squeeze. </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Theon nearly jumped from his chair. “What, don’t you want me to steer you into port, </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">brother?” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Marriage is not for you,” Theon decided. “When I rule, I believe I will pack you off to </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">the silent sisters.” He lurched to his feet and strode off unsteadily to find his father. </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Rain was falling by the time he reached the swaying bridge out to the Sea Tower. His </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stomach was crashing and churning like the waves below, and wine had unsteadied his feet. </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon gritted his teeth and gripped the rope tightly as he made his way across, pretending that </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="254" height="15" font="1">it was Asha’s neck he was clutching. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The solar was as damp and drafty as ever. Buried under his sealskin robes, his father sat </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before the brazier with his brothers on either side of him. Victarion was talking of tides and </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">winds when Theon entered, but Lord Balon waved him silent. “I have made my plans. It is </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="156" height="15" font="1">time you heard them.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="201" height="15" font="1">“I have some suggestions—” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“When I require your counsel I shall ask for it,” his father said. “We have had a bird from </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Old Wyk. Dagmer is bringing the Drumms and Stonehouses. If the god grants us good winds, </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">we will sail when they arrive . . . or you will. I mean for you to strike the first blow, Theon. </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">You shall take eight longships north—” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“<i>Eight?</i>” His face reddened. “What can I hope to accomplish with only eight longships?” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You are to harry the Stony Shore, raiding the fishing villages and sinking any ships you </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chance to meet. It may be that you will draw some of the northern lords out from behind their </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">stone walls. Aeron will accompany you, and Dagmer Cleftjaw.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="400" height="15" font="1">“May the Drowned God bless our swords,” the priest said. </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Theon felt as if he’d been slapped. He was being sent to do reaver’s work, burning </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fishermen out of their hovels and raping their ugly daughters, and yet it seemed Lord Balon </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">did not trust him sufficiently to do even that much. Bad enough to have to suffer the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Damphair’s scowls and chidings. With Dagmer Cleftjaw along as well, his command would </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">be purely nominal. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Asha my daughter,” Lord Balon went on, and Theon turned to see that his sister had </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slipped in silently, “you shall take thirty longships of picked men round Sea Dragon Point. </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Land upon the tidal flats north of Deepwood Motte. March quickly, and the castle may fall </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="301" height="15" font="1">before they even know you are upon them.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="549" height="15" font="1">Asha smiled like a cat in cream. “I’ve always wanted a castle,” she said sweetly. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="119" height="15" font="1">“Then take one.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon had to bite his tongue. Deepwood Motte was the stronghold of the Glovers. With </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">both Robett and Galbart warring in the south, it would be lightly held, and once the castle fell </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the ironmen would have a secure base in the heart of the north. <i>I should be the one sent to take </i></text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Deepwood.</i> He knew Deepwood Motte, he had visited the Glovers several times with Eddard </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">Stark. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Victarion,” Lord Balon said to his brother, “the main thrust shall fall to you. When my </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sons have struck their blows, Winterfell must respond. You should meet small opposition as </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">you sail up Saltspear and the Fever River. At the headwaters, you will be less than twenty </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">miles from Moat Cailin. The Neck is the key to the kingdom. Already we command the </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">western seas. Once we hold Moat Cailin, the pup will not be able to win back to the </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">north . . . and if he is fool enough to try, his enemies will seal the south end of the causeway </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">behind him, and Robb the boy will find himself caught like a rat in a bottle.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="603" height="15" font="1">Theon could keep silent no longer. “A bold plan, Father, but the lords in their castles—” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Balon rode over him. “The lords are gone south with the pup. Those who remained </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">behind are the cravens, old men, and green boys. They will yield or fall, one by one. </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest and field and </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">hall, and we shall make the folk our thralls and salt wives.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Aeron Damphair raised his arms. “And the waters of wrath will rise high, and the </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="439" height="15" font="1">Drowned God will spread his dominion across the green lands!” </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What is dead can never die,” Victarion intoned. Lord Balon and Asha echoed his words, </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">and Theon had no choice but to mumble along with them. And then it was done. </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Outside the rain was falling harder than ever. The rope bridge twisted and writhed under </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his feet. Theon Greyjoy stopped in the center of the span and contemplated the rocks below. </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The sound of the waves was a crashing roar, and he could taste the salt spray on his lips. A </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">sudden gust of wind made him lose his footing, and he stumbled to his knees. </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="450" height="15" font="1">Asha helped him rise. “You can’t hold your wine either, brother.” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon leaned on her shoulder and let her guide him across the rain-slick boards. “I liked </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="401" height="15" font="1">you better when you were Esgred,” he told her accusingly. </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="451" height="15" font="1">She laughed. “That’s fair. I liked <i>you</i> better when you were nine.” </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="4" height="15" font="1"> </text>

<text top="998" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Through the door came the soft sound of the high harp, mingled with a trilling of pipes. </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The singer’s voice was muffled by the thick walls, yet Tyrion knew the verse. <i>I loved a maid </i></text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="437" height="15" font="5"><i>as fair as summer</i>, he remembered, <i>with sunlight in her hair . . .</i> </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Meryn Trant guarded the queen’s door this night. His muttered “My lord” struck </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tyrion as a tad grudging, but he opened the door nonetheless. The song broke off abruptly as </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">he strode into his sister’s bedchamber. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei was reclining on a pile of cushions. Her feet were bare, her golden hair artfully </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tousled, her robe a green-and-gold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as she looked up. “Sweet sister,” Tyrion said, “how beautiful you look tonight.” He turned to </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">the singer. “And you as well, cousin. I had no notion you had such a lovely voice.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The compliment made Ser Lancel sulky; perhaps he thought he was being mocked. It </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seemed to Tyrion that the lad had grown three inches since being knighted. Lancel had thick </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sandy hair, green Lannister eyes, and a line of soft blond fuzz on his upper lip. At sixteen, he </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was cursed with all the certainty of youth, unleavened by any trace of humor or self-doubt, </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and wed to the arrogance that came so naturally to those born blond and strong and handsome. </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">His recent elevation had only made him worse. “Did Her Grace send for you?” the boy </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">demanded. </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Not that I recall,” Tyrion admitted. “It grieves me to disturb your revels, Lancel, but as </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="428" height="15" font="1">it happens, I have matters of import to discuss with my sister.” </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei regarded him suspiciously. “If you are here about those begging brothers, Tyrion, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spare me your reproaches. I won’t have them spreading their filthy treasons in the streets. </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="331" height="15" font="1">They can preach to each other in the dungeons.” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“And count themselves lucky that they have such a gentle queen,” added Lancel. “I </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">would have had their tongues out.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“One even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because Jaime murdered the </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rightful king,” Cersei declared. “It will not be borne, Tyrion. I gave you ample opportunity to </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">deal with these lice, but you and your Ser Jacelyn did nothing, so I commanded Vylarr to </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">attend to the matter.” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And so he did.” Tyrion <i>had</i> been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting him, but they were not </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">important enough to battle over. “No doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">streets. That is not why I came. I have tidings I know you will be anxious to hear, sweet sister, </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">but they are best spoken of privily.” </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Very well.” The harpist and the piper bowed and hurried out, while Cersei kissed her </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cousin chastely on the cheek. “Leave us, Lancel. My brother’s harmless when he’s alone. If </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="280" height="15" font="1">he’d brought his pets, we’d smell them.” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The young knight gave his cousin a baleful glance and pulled the door shut forcefully </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">behind him. “I’ll have you know I make Shagga bathe once a fortnight,” Tyrion said when he </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">was gone. </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“You’re very pleased with yourself, aren’t you? Why?” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why not?” Tyrion said. Every day, every night, hammers rang along the Street of Steel, </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and the great chain grew longer. He hopped up onto the great canopied bed. “Is this the bed </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">where Robert died? I’m surprised you kept it.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It gives me sweet dreams,” she said. “Now spit out your business and waddle away, </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="1">Imp.” </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="413" height="15" font="1">Tyrion smiled. “Lord Stannis has sailed from Dragonstone.” </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Cersei bolted to her feet. “And yet you sit there grinning like a harvest-day pumpkin? </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Has Bywater called out the City Watch? We must send a bird to Harrenhal at once.” He was </text>

<page number="214" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">laughing by then. She seized him by the shoulders and shook him. “Stop it. Are you mad, or </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">drunk? <i>Stop it!</i>” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was all he could do to get out the words. “I can’t,” he gasped. “It’s too . . . gods, too </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="156" height="15" font="1">funny . . . Stannis . . .” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="63" height="15" font="1">“<i>What?</i>” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He hasn’t sailed against us,” Tyrion managed. “He’s laid siege to Storm’s End. Renly is </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">riding to meet him.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His sister’s nails dug painfully into his arms. For a moment she stared incredulous, as if </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">he had begun to gibber in an unknown tongue. “Stannis and Renly are fighting <i>each other?</i>” </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">When he nodded, Cersei began to chuckle. “Gods be good,” she gasped, “I’m starting to </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">believe that Robert was the <i>clever</i> one.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion threw back his head and roared. They laughed together. Cersei pulled him off the </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bed and whirled him around and even hugged him, for a moment as giddy as a girl. By the </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">time she let go of him, Tyrion was breathless and dizzy. He staggered to her sideboard and put </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">out a hand to steady himself. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Do you think it will truly come to battle between them? If they should come to some </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">accord—” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They won’t,” Tyrion said. “They are too different and yet too much alike, and neither </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">could ever stomach the other.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And Stannis has always felt he was cheated of Storm’s End,” Cersei said thoughtfully. </text>

<text top="349" left="139" width="533" height="15" font="1">right nor left. As he knelt, Tyrion observed that his cousin was losing his hair. </text>

<text top="419" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Grand Maester Pycelle cleared his throat. “The Queen Regent, the King’s Hand, and the </text>

<text top="605" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cleos Frey looked ill. “My lord Hand,” he said, “Lord Stark will never consent to these </text>

<text top="650" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>We never expected he would, Cleos.</i> “Tell him that we have raised another great host at </text>

<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Tion. Tell Stark that two Lannisters are worth four northmen in any season.” He waited for </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">the laughter to die. “His father’s bones he shall have, as a gesture of Joffrey’s good faith.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Lord Stark asked for his sisters and his father’s sword as well,” Ser Cleos reminded </text>

<text top="901" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Ser Ilyn Payne stood mute, the hilt of Eddard Stark’s greatsword rising over one </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="628" height="15" font="1">shoulder. “Ice,” said Tyrion. “He’ll have that when he makes his peace with us, not before.” </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="210" height="15" font="1">“As you say. And his sisters?” </text>
<text top="970" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion glanced toward Sansa, and felt a stab of pity as he said, “Until such time as he </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">frees my brother Jaime, unharmed, they shall remain here as hostages. How well they are </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Tyrion plucked at one of the twisted blades that sprang from the arm of the throne. <i>And </i></text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="5"><i>now the thrust.</i> “Vylarr,” he called. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="79" height="15" font="1">“My lord.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The men Stark sent are sufficient to protect Lord Eddard’s bones, but a Lannister should </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">have a Lannister escort,” Tyrion declared. “Ser Cleos is the queen’s cousin, and mine. We </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">shall sleep more easily if you would see him safely back to Riverrun.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="355" height="15" font="1">“As you command. How many men should I take?” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="138" height="15" font="1">“Why, all of them.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Vylarr stood like a man made of stone. It was Grand Maester Pycelle who rose, gasping, </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“My lord Hand, that cannot . . . your father, Lord Tywin himself, he sent these good men to </text>

<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The Kingsguard and the City Watch protect them well enough. The gods speed you on </text>

<text top="397" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">At the council table Varys smiled knowingly, Littlefinger sat feigning boredom, and </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Pycelle gaped like a fish, pale and confused. A herald stepped forward. “If any man has other </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">matters to set before the King’s Hand, let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“<i>I</i> will be heard.” A slender man all in black pushed his way between the Redwyne twins. </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ser Alliser!</i>” Tyrion exclaimed. “Why, I had no notion that you’d come to court. You </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">should have sent me word.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I have, as well you know.” Thorne was as prickly as his name, a spare, sharp-featured </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">man of fifty, hard-eyed and hard-handed, his black hair streaked with grey. “I have been </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="431" height="15" font="1">shunned, ignored, and left to wait like some baseborn servant.” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Truly? Bronn, this was not well done. Ser Alliser and I are old friends. We walked the </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">Wall together.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sweet Ser Alliser,” murmured Varys, “you must not think too harshly of us. So many </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="450" height="15" font="1">seek our Joffrey’s grace, in these troubled and tumultuous times.” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="283" height="15" font="1">“More troubled than you know, eunuch.” </text>
<text top="709" left="171" width="420" height="15" font="1">“To his face we call him <i>Lord</i> Eunuch,” quipped Littlefinger. </text>
<text top="734" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“How may we be of help to you, good brother?” Grand Maester Pycelle asked in </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">soothing tones. </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The Lord Commander sent me to His Grace the king,” Thorne answered. “The matter is </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">too grave to be left to servants.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The king is playing with his new crossbow,” Tyrion said. Ridding himself of Joffrey </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">had required only an ungainly Myrish crossbow that threw three quarrels at a time, and </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">nothing would do but that he try it at once. “You can speak to servants or hold your silence.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As you will,” Ser Alliser said, displeasure in every word. “I am sent to tell you that we </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">found two rangers, long missing. They were dead, yet when we brought the corpses back to </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Wall they rose again in the night. One slew Ser Jaremy Rykker, while the second tried to </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">murder the Lord Commander.” </text>
<text top="971" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Distantly, Tyrion heard someone snigger. <i>Does he mean to mock me with this folly?</i> He </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shifted uneasily and glanced down at Varys, Littlefinger, and Pycelle, wondering if one of </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them had a role in this. A dwarf enjoyed at best a tenuous hold on dignity. Once the court and </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">kingdom started to laugh at him, he was doomed. And yet . . . and yet . . . </text>

<page number="217" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion remembered a cold night under the stars when he’d stood beside the boy Jon </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Snow and a great white wolf atop the Wall at the end of the world, gazing out at the trackless </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dark beyond. He had felt—what?—<i>something</i>, to be sure, a dread that had cut like that frigid </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">northern wind. A wolf had howled off in the night, and the sound had sent a shiver through </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="35" height="15" font="1">him. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Don’t be a fool</i>, he told himself. <i>A wolf, a wind, a dark forest, it meant nothing. And </i></text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>yet . . .</i> He had come to have a liking for old Jeor Mormont during his time at Castle Black. “I </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">trust that the Old Bear survived this attack?” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="69" height="15" font="1">“He did.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“And that your brothers killed these, ah, dead men?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="73" height="15" font="1">“We did.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You’re certain that they are dead this time?” Tyrion asked mildly. When Bronn choked </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">on a snort of laughter, he knew how he must proceed. “Truly truly dead?” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They were dead the first time,” Ser Alliser snapped. “Pale and cold, with black hands </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">and feet. I brought Jared’s hand, torn from his corpse by the bastard’s wolf.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger stirred. “And where is this charming token?” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Ser Alliser frowned uncomfortably. “It . . . rotted to pieces while I waited, unheard. </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="272" height="15" font="1">There’s naught left to show but bones.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Titters echoed through the hall. “Lord Baelish,” Tyrion called down to Littlefinger, “buy </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="1">our brave Ser Alliser a hundred spades to take back to the Wall with him.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="371" height="15" font="1">“Spades?” Ser Alliser narrowed his eyes suspiciously. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“If you <i>bury</i> your dead, they won’t come walking,” Tyrion told him, and the court </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">laughed openly. “Spades will end your troubles, with some strong backs to wield them. Ser </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">Jacelyn, see that the good brother has his pick of the city dungeons.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Jacelyn Bywater said, “As you will, my lord, but the cells are near empty. Yoren took </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">all the likely men.” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Arrest some more, then,” Tyrion told him. “Or spread the word that there’s bread and </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">turnips on the Wall, and they’ll go of their own accord.” The city had too many mouths to </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">feed, and the Night’s Watch a perpetual need of men. At Tyrion’s signal, the herald cried an </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">end, and the hall began to empty. </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Alliser Thorne was not so easily dismissed. He was waiting at the foot of the iron </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">Throne when Tyrion descended. “Do you think I sailed all the way from Eastwatch-by-the-</text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sea to be mocked by the likes of you?” he fumed, blocking the way. “This is no jape. I saw it </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="312" height="15" font="1">with my own eyes. I tell you, the dead walk.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="463" height="15" font="1">“You should try to kill them more thoroughly.” Tyrion pushed past. </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Alliser made to grab his sleeve, but Preston Greenfield thrust him back. “No closer, </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="36" height="15" font="1">ser.” </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Thorne knew better than to challenge a knight of the Kingsguard. “You are a fool, Imp,” </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">he shouted at Tyrion’s back. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The dwarf turned to face him. “Me? Truly? Then why were they laughing at you, I </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">wonder?” He smiled wanly. “You came for men, did you not?” </text>

<text top="684" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Walk with me, Varys,” said Tyrion. They left through the king’s door behind the throne, </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="222" height="15" font="1">“I like her uneasy,” said Tyrion. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos Frey left that very afternoon, escorted by Vylarr and a hundred red-cloaked </text>

<text top="277" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">midnight.” Timett gave him a hard one-eyed stare, a curt nod. He was not one for long </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">speeches. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That night he feasted with the Stone Crows and Moon Brothers in the Small Hall, though </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">he shunned the wine for once. He wanted all his wits about him. “Shagga, what moon is this?” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="356" height="15" font="1">Shagga’s frown was a fierce thing. “Black, I think.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“In the west, they call that a traitor’s moon. Try not to get too drunk tonight, and see that </text>

<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A Stone Crow’s axe is always sharp, and Shagga’s axes are sharpest of all. Once I cut </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="599" height="15" font="1">off a man’s head, but he did not know it until he tried to brush his hair. Then it fell off.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Is that why you never brush yours?” The Stone Crows roared and stamped their feet, </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">Shagga hooting loudest of all. </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">By midnight, the castle was silent and dark. Doubtless a few gold cloaks on the walls </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">spied them leaving the Tower of the Hand, but no one raised a voice. He was the Hand of the </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">King, and where he went was his own affair. </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The thin wooden door split with a thunderous crack beneath the heel of Shagga’s boot. </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Pieces went flying inward, and Tyrion heard a woman’s gasp of fear. Shagga hacked the door </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">apart with three great blows of his axe and kicked his way through the ruins. Timett followed, </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and then Tyrion, stepping gingerly over the splinters. The fire had burned down to a few </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">glowing embers, and shadows lay thick across the bedchamber. When Timett ripped the </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heavy curtains off the bed, the naked serving girl stared up with wide white eyes. “Please, my </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">lords,” she pleaded, “don’t hurt me.” She cringed away from Shagga, flushed and fearful, </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="483" height="15" font="1">trying to cover her charms with her hands and coming up a hand short. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“Go,” Tyrion told her. “It’s not you we want.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="200" height="15" font="1">“Shagga wants this woman.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="585" height="15" font="1">“Shagga wants every whore in this city of whores,” complained Timett son of Timett. </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="495" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” Shagga said, unabashed. “Shagga would give her a strong child.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If she wants a strong child, she’ll know whom to seek,” Tyrion said. “Timett, see her </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="1">out . . . gently, if you would.” </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Burned Man pulled the girl from the bed and half marched, half dragged her across </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the chamber. Shagga watched them go, mournful as a puppy. The girl stumbled over the </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shattered door and out into the hall, helped along by a firm shove from Timett. Above their </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="238" height="15" font="1">heads, the ravens were screeching. </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion dragged the soft blanket off the bed, uncovering Grand Maester Pycelle beneath. </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">“Tell me, does the Citadel approve of you bedding the serving wenches, Maester?” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The old man was as naked as the girl, though he made a markedly less attractive sight. </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">For once, his heavy-lidded eyes were open wide. “W-what is the meaning of this? I am an old </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion hoisted himself onto the bed. “So loyal that you sent only one of my letters to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“N-no,” squealed Pycelle. “No, a falsehood, I swear it, it was not me. Varys, it was </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Do all maesters lie so poorly? I told Varys that I was giving Prince Doran my nephew </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Tommen to foster. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed Myrcella to Lord Robert of the </text>

<text top="277" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Pycelle clutched for a corner of the blanket. “Birds are lost, messages stolen or sold . . . it </text>

<text top="321" left="171" width="226" height="15" font="1">“My lady prefers my blood hot.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Make no mistake, for every secret the eunuch whispers in your ear, he holds seven back. </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">And Littlefinger, that one . . .” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I know all about Lord Petyr. He’s almost as untrustworthy as you. Shagga, cut off his </text>

<text top="436" left="171" width="513" height="15" font="1">Shagga hefted the huge double-bladed axe. “There are no goats, Halfman.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="83" height="15" font="1">“Make do.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Roaring, Shagga leapt forward. Pycelle shrieked and wet the bed, urine spraying in all </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">directions as he tried to scramble back out of reach. The wildling caught him by the end of his </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">billowy white beard and hacked off three-quarters of it with a single slash of the axe. </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Timett, do you suppose our friend will be more forthcoming without those whiskers to </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">hide behind?” Tyrion used a bit of the sheet to wipe the piss off his boots. </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He will tell the truth soon.” Darkness pooled in the empty pit of Timett’s burned eye. “I </text>

<text top="639" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Shagga tossed a handful of hair down to the rushes, and seized what beard was left. </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">“Hold still, Maester,” urged Tyrion. “When Shagga gets angry, his hands shake.” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Shagga’s hands never shake,” the huge man said indignantly, pressing the great crescent </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">blade under Pycelle’s quivering chin and sawing through another tangle of beard. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="433" height="15" font="1">“How long have you been spying for my sister?” Tyrion asked. </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Pycelle’s breathing was rapid and shallow. “All I did, I did for House Lannister.” A </text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sheen of sweat covered the broad dome of the old man’s brow, and wisps of white hair clung </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to his wrinkled skin. “Always . . . for years . . . your lord father, ask him, I was ever his true </text>

<text top="837" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>That</i> took Tyrion by surprise. He had been no more than an ugly boy at Casterly Rock </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="519" height="15" font="1">when the city fell. “So the Sack of King’s Landing was your work as well?” </text>
<text top="882" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“For the realm! Once Rhaegar died, the war was done. Aerys was mad, Viserys too </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The axe scratched at the apple of Pycelle’s throat and stroked the soft wobbly skin under </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his jaw, scraping away the last hairs. “You . . . were not here,” he gasped when the blade </text>

<text top="263" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I know what he knew about,” snapped Tyrion, who was not anxious for Shagga and </text>

<text top="397" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">hand was so big he could have crushed the maester’s skull like an eggshell had he squeezed. </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion  <i>tsk</i>ed at him. “I saw the tears of Lys among your potions. And you sent away </text>

<text top="467" left="171" width="107" height="15" font="1">“A falsehood!” </text>
<text top="492" left="171" width="400" height="15" font="1">“Shave him closer,” Tyrion suggested. “The throat again.” </text>
<text top="517" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The axe swept back down, rasping over the skin. A thin film of spit bubbled on Pycelle’s </text>

<text top="561" left="171" width="277" height="15" font="1">“Careful now, Shagga, you’ve cut him.” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="377" height="15" font="1">Shagga growled. “Dolf fathered warriors, not barbers.” </text>
<text top="612" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">When he felt the blood trickling down his neck and onto his chest, the old man </text>
<text top="631" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shuddered, and the last strength went out of him. He looked shrunken, both smaller and frailer </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">than he had been when they burst in on him. “Yes,” he whimpered, “<i>yes</i>, Colemon was </text>
<text top="670" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">purging, so I sent him away. The queen needed Lord Arryn dead, she did not say so, could </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not, Varys was listening, always listening, but when I looked at her I knew. It was not me who </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gave him the poison, though, I swear it.” The old man wept. “Varys will tell you, it was the </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">boy, his squire, Hugh he was called, he must surely have done it, ask your sister, ask her.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tyrion was disgusted. “Bind him and take him away,” he commanded. “Throw him </text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">down in one of the black cells.” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They dragged him out the splintered door. “Lannister,” he moaned, “all I’ve done has </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="161" height="15" font="1">been for Lannister . . .” </text>
<text top="843" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When he was gone, Tyrion made a leisurely search of the quarters and collected a few </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">more small jars from his shelves. The ravens muttered above his head as he worked, a </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">strangely peaceful noise. He would need to find someone to tend the birds until the Citadel </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">sent a man to replace Pycelle. </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="5"><i>He was the one I’d hoped to trust.</i> Varys and Littlefinger were no more loyal, he </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">suspected . . . only more subtle, and thus more dangerous. Perhaps his father’s way would </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">have been best: summon Ilyn Payne, mount three heads above the gates, and have done. <i>And </i></text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="252" height="15" font="1">day of walking the hard, rutted road. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She had thought she had known what it meant to be afraid, but she learned better in that </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">storehouse beside the Gods Eye. Eight days she had lingered there before the Mountain gave </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="447" height="15" font="1">the command to march, and every day she had seen someone die. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Mountain would come into the storehouse after he had broken his fast and pick one </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of the prisoners for questioning. The village folk would never look at him. Maybe they </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought that if they did not notice him, he would not notice them . . . but he saw them anyway </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="623" height="15" font="1">and picked whom he liked. There was no place to hide, no tricks to play, no way to be safe. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">One girl shared a soldier’s bed three nights running; the Mountain picked her on the </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">fourth day, and the soldier said nothing. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A smiley old man mended their clothing and babbled about his son, off serving in the </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gold cloaks at King’s Landing. “A king’s man, he is,” he would say, “a good king’s man like </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">me, all for Joffrey.” He said it so often the other captives began to call him All-for-Joffrey </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">whenever the guards weren’t listening. All-for-Joffrey was picked on the fifth day. </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A young mother with a pox-scarred face offered to freely tell them all she knew if they’d </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">promise not to hurt her daughter. The Mountain heard her out; the next morning he picked her </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">daughter, to be certain she’d held nothing back. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The ones chosen were questioned in full view of the other captives, so they could see the </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fate of rebels and traitors. A man the others called the Tickler asked the questions. His face </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was so ordinary and his garb so plain that Arya might have thought him one of the villagers </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">before she had seen him at his work. “Tickler makes them howl so hard they piss </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">themselves,” old stoop-shoulder Chiswyck told them. He was the man she’d tried to bite, </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">who’d called her a fierce little thing and smashed her head with a mailed fist. Sometimes he </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">helped the Tickler. Sometimes others did that. Ser Gregor Clegane himself would stand </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="389" height="15" font="1">motionless, watching and listening, until the victim died. </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The questions were always the same. Was there gold hidden in the village? Silver, gems? </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Was there more food? Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion? Which of the village folk had </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">aided him? When he rode off, where did he go? How many men were with them? How many </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knights, how many bowmen, how many men-at-arms? How were they armed? How many </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">were horsed? How many were wounded? What other enemy had they seen? How many? </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">When? What banners did they fly? Where did they go? Was there gold hidden in the village? </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Silver, gems? Where was Lord Beric Dondarrion? How many men were with him? By the </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">third day, Arya could have asked the questions herself. </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">They found a little gold, a little silver, a great sack of copper pennies, and a dented goblet </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">set with garnets that two soldiers almost came to blows over. They learned that Lord Beric </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had ten starvelings with him, or else a hundred mounted knights; that he had ridden west, or </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">north, or south; that he had crossed the lake in a boat; that he was strong as an aurochs or </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">weak from the bloody flux. No one ever survived the Tickler’s questioning; no man, no </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">woman, no child. The strongest lasted past evenfall. Their bodies were hung beyond the fires </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">for the wolves. </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By the time they marched, Arya knew she was no water dancer. Syrio Forel would never </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">have let them knock him down and take his sword away, nor stood by when they killed </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lommy Greenhands. Syrio would never have sat silent in that storehouse nor shuffled along </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">meekly among the other captives. The direwolf was the sigil of the Starks, but Arya felt more </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a lamb, surrounded by a herd of other sheep. She hated the villagers for their sheepishness, </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="250" height="15" font="1">almost as much as she hated herself. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The Lannisters had taken everything: father, friends, home, hope, courage. One had taken </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Needle, while another had broken her wooden stick sword over his knee. They had even taken </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her stupid secret. The storehouse had been big enough for her to creep off and make her water </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in some corner when no one was looking, but it was different on the road. She held it as long </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as she could, but finally she had to squat by a bush and skin down her breeches in front of all </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of them. It was that or wet herself. Hot Pie gaped at her with big moon eyes, but no one else </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">even troubled to look. Girl sheep or boy sheep, Ser Gregor and his men did not seem to care. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Their captors permitted no chatter. A broken lip taught Arya to hold her tongue. Others </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">never learned at all. One boy of three would not stop calling for his father, so they smashed </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">his face in with a spiked mace. Then the boy’s mother started screaming and Raff the </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">Sweetling killed her as well. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya watched them die and did nothing. What good did it do you to be brave? One of the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">women picked for questioning had tried to be brave, but she had died screaming like all the </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rest. There were no brave people on that march, only scared and hungry ones. Most were </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">women and children. The few men were very old or very young; the rest had been chained to </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">that gibbet and left for the wolves and the crows. Gendry was only spared because he’d </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">admitted to forging the horned helm himself; smiths, even apprentice smiths, were too </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="110" height="15" font="1">valuable to kill. </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They were being taken to serve Lord Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal, the Mountain told </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">them. “You’re traitors and rebels, so thank your gods that Lord Tywin’s giving you this </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="506" height="15" font="1">chance. It’s more than you’d get from the outlaws. Obey, serve, and live.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s not just, it’s not,” she heard one wizened old woman complain to another when they </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had bedded down for the night. “We never did no treason, the others come in and took what </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">they wanted, same as this bunch.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lord Beric did us no hurt, though,” her friend whispered. “And that red priest with him, </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">he paid for all they took.” </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Paid? He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it. Can I </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eat a bit of raggy old paper, I ask you? Will it give me eggs?” She looked about to see that no </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">guards were near, and spat three times. “There’s for the Tullys and there’s for the Lannisters </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">and there’s for the Starks.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s a sin and a shame,” an old man hissed. “When the old king was still alive, he’d not </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">have stood for this.” </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“King Robert?” Arya asked, forgetting herself. </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“King  <i>Aerys</i>, gods grace him,” the old man said, too loudly. A guard came sauntering </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="626" height="15" font="1">over to shut them up. The old man lost both his teeth, and there was no more talk that night. </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Besides his captives, Ser Gregor was bringing back a dozen pigs, a cage of chickens, a </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">scrawny milk cow, and nine wagons of salt fish. The Mountain and his men had horses, but </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the captives were all afoot, and those too weak to keep up were killed out of hand, along with </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">anyone foolish enough to flee. The guards took women off into the bushes at night, and most </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">seemed to expect it and went along meekly enough. One girl, prettier than the others, was </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">made to go with four or five different men every night, until finally she hit one with a rock. </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">Ser Gregor made everyone watch while he took off her head with a sweep of his massive two-</text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">handed greatsword. “Leave the body for the wolves,” he commanded when the deed was </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">done, handing the sword to his squire to be cleaned. </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Arya glanced sidelong at Needle, sheathed at the hip of a black-bearded, balding man-at-</text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Polliver was not so bad as some of the others, even though he’d stolen Needle. The night </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she was caught, the Lannister men had been nameless strangers with faces as alike as their </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nasal helms, but she’d come to know them all. You had to know who was lazy and who was </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cruel, who was smart and who was stupid. You had to learn that even though the one they </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">called Shitmouth had the foulest tongue she’d ever heard, he’d give you an extra piece of </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bread if you asked, while jolly old Chiswyck and soft-spoken Raff would just give you the </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="131" height="15" font="1">back of their hand. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya watched and listened and polished her hates the way Gendry had once polished his </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">horned helm. Dunsen wore those bull’s horns now, and she hated him for it. She hated </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Polliver for Needle, and she hated old Chiswyck who thought he was funny. And Raff the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Sweetling, who’d driven his spear through Lommy’s throat, she hated even more. She hated </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ser Amory Lorch for Yoren, and she hated Ser Meryn Trant for Syrio, the Hound for killing </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the butcher’s boy Mycah, and Ser Ilyn and Prince Joffrey and the queen for the sake of her </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">father and Fat Tom and Desmond and the rest, and even for Lady, Sansa’s wolf. The Tickler </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was almost too scary to hate. At times she could almost forget he was still with them; when he </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was not asking questions, he was just another soldier, quieter than most, with a face like a </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">thousand other men. </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Every night Arya would say their names. “Ser Gregor,” she’d whisper to her stone </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">pillow. “Dunsen, Polliver, Chiswyck, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.” Back in Winterfell, Arya had </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">prayed with her mother in the sept and with her father in the godswood, but there were no </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="618" height="15" font="1">gods on the road to Harrenhal, and her names were the only prayer she cared to remember. </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Every day they marched, and every night she said her names, until finally the trees </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">thinned and gave way to a patchwork landscape of rolling hills, meandering streams, and </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sunlit fields, where the husks of burnt holdfasts thrust up black as rotten teeth. It was another </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">long day’s march before they glimpsed the towers of Harrenhal in the distance, hard beside </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">the blue waters of the lake. </text>
<text top="697" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It would be better once they got to Harrenhal, the captives told each other, but Arya was </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not so certain. She remembered Old Nan’s stories of the castle built on fear. Harren the Black </text>

<text top="755" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would need to lean close to hear, but Aegon’s dragons had roasted Harren and all his sons </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">within their great walls of stone. Arya chewed her lip as she walked along on feet grown hard </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with callus. It would not be much longer, she told herself; those towers could not be more </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">than a few miles off. </text>
<text top="839" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yet they walked all that day and most of the next before at last they reached the fringes </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of Lord Tywin’s army, encamped west of the castle amidst the scorched remains of a town. </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal was deceptive from afar, because it was so <i>huge</i>. Its colossal curtain walls rose </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beside the lake, sheer and sudden as mountain cliffs, while atop their battlements the rows of </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">wood-and-iron scorpions looked as small as the bugs for which they were named. </text>
<text top="942" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The stink of the Lannister host reached Arya well before she could make out the devices </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">on the banners that sprouted along the lakeshore, atop the pavilions of the westermen. From </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the smell, Arya could tell that Lord Tywin had been here some time. The latrines that ringed </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the encampment were overflowing and swarming with flies, and she saw faint greenish fuzz </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">on many of the sharpened stakes that protected the perimeters. </text>
<text top="1045" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal’s gatehouse, itself as large as Winterfell’s Great Keep, was as scarred as it was </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">massive, its stones fissured and discolored. From outside, only the tops of five immense </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">towers could be seen beyond the walls. The shortest of them was half again as tall as the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">highest tower in Winterfell, but they did not soar the way a proper tower did. Arya thought </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they looked like some old man’s gnarled, knuckly fingers groping after a passing cloud. She </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remembered Nan telling how the stone had melted and flowed like candlewax down the steps </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and in the windows, glowing a sullen searing red as it sought out Harren where he hid. Arya </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could believe every word; each tower was more grotesque and misshapen than the last, lumpy </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">and runneled and cracked. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I don’t want to go there,” Hot Pie squeaked as Harrenhal opened its gates to them. </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">“There’s ghosts in there.” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Chiswyck heard him, but for once he only smiled. “Baker boy, here’s your choice. Come </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">join the ghosts, or be one.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie went in with the rest of them. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the echoing stone-and-timber bathhouse, the captives were stripped and made to scrub </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and scrape themselves raw in tubs of scalding hot water. Two fierce old women supervised </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the process, discussing them as bluntly as if they were newly acquired donkeys. When Arya’s </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">turn came round, Goodwife Amabel clucked in dismay at the sight of her feet, while </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Goodwife Harra felt the callus on her fingers that long hours of practice with Needle had </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">earned her. “Got those churning butter, I’ll wager,” she said. “Some farmer’s whelp, are you? </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Well, never you mind, girl, you have a chance to win a higher place in this world if you work </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">hard. If you won’t work hard, you’ll be beaten. And what do they call you?” </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya dared not say her true name, but Arry was no good either, it was a boy’s name and </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they could see she was no boy. “Weasel,” she said, naming the first girl she could think of. </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">“Lommy called me Weasel.” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I can see why,” sniffed Goodwife Amabel. “That hair is a fright and a nest for lice as </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="390" height="15" font="1">well. We’ll have it off, and then you’re for the kitchens.” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’d sooner tend the horses.” Arya liked horses, and maybe if she was in the stables she’d </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">be able to steal one and escape. </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Goodwife Harra slapped her so hard that her swollen lip broke open all over again. “And </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">keep that tongue to yourself or you’ll get worse. No one asked your views.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The blood in her mouth had a salty metal tang to it. Arya dropped her gaze and said </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">nothing. <i>If I still had Needle, she wouldn’t dare hit me</i>, she thought sullenly. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Lord Tywin and his knights have grooms and squires to tend their horses, they don’t </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">need the likes of you,” Goodwife Amabel said. “The kitchens are snug and clean, and there’s </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">always a warm fire to sleep by and plenty to eat. You might have done well there, but I can </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="542" height="15" font="1">see you’re not a clever girl. Harra, I believe we should give this one to Weese.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you think so, Amabel.” They gave her a shift of grey rough-spun wool and a pair of </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">ill-fitting shoes, and sent her off. </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Weese was understeward for the Wailing Tower, a squat man with a fleshy carbuncle of </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a nose and a nest of angry red boils near one corner of his plump lips. Arya was one of six </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sent to him. He looked them all over with a gimlet eye. “The Lannisters are generous to those </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as serve them well, an honor none of your sort deserve, but in war a man makes do with </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">what’s to hand. Work hard and mind your place and might be one day you’ll rise as high as </text>

<text top="1009" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">m’lord has gone, y’see.” He strutted up and down before them, telling them how they must </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">never look the highborn in the eye, nor speak until spoken to, nor get in his lordship’s way. </text>

<text top="224" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">On the walls of Qarth, men beat gongs to herald her coming, while others blew curious </text>
<text top="243" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horns that encircled their bodies like great bronze snakes. A column of camelry emerged from </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the city as her honor guards. The riders wore scaled copper armor and snouted helms with </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">copper tusks and long black silk plumes, and sat high on saddles inlaid with rubies and </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="512" height="15" font="1">garnets. Their camels were dressed in blankets of a hundred different hues. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be,” Pyat Pree had told her, back </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">amongst the bones of Vaes Tolorro. “It is the center of the world, the gate between north and </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">south, the bridge between east and west, ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that Saathos the Wise put out his eyes after gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because he </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Dany took the warlock’s words well salted, but the magnificence of the great city was not </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">to be denied. Three thick walls encircled Qarth, elaborately carved. The outer was red </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sandstone, thirty feet high and decorated with animals: snakes slithering, kites flying, fish </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">swimming, intermingled with wolves of the red waste and striped horses and monstrous </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">elephants. The middle wall, forty feet high, was grey granite alive with scenes of war: the </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">clash of sword and shield and spear, arrows in flight, heroes at battle and babes being </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">butchered, pyres of the dead. The innermost wall was fifty feet of black marble, with carvings </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that made Dany blush until she told herself that she was being a fool. She was no maid; if she </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">could look on the grey wall’s scenes of slaughter, why should she avert her eyes from the </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="389" height="15" font="1">sight of men and women giving pleasure to one another? </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The outer gates were banded with copper, the middle with iron; the innermost were </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">studded with golden eyes. All opened at Dany’s approach. As she rode her silver into the city, </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">small children rushed out to scatter flowers in her path. They wore golden sandals and bright </text>

<text top="714" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found their way to Qarth; </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose, violet, and umber. </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating, their scales </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">delicate flakes of jade, obsidian, and lapis lazuli. Slim towers stood taller than any Dany had </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ever seen, and elaborate fountains filled every square, wrought in the shapes of griffins and </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">dragons and manticores. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to support their weight. They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur, every one a </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">lord or lady to her eyes. The women wore gowns that left one breast bare, while the men </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">favored beaded silk skirts. Dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in her lionskin </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">robe with black Drogon on one shoulder. Her Dothraki called the Qartheen “Milk Men” for </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gaily-colored birds. Trees and flowers bloomed on the terraced walls above the stalls, while </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">below it seemed as if everything the gods had put into the world was for sale. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her silver shied as the merchant prince Xaro Xhoan Daxos rode up to her; the horses </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could not abide the close presence of camels, she had found. “If you see here anything that </text>

<text top="207" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">called down from his ornate horned saddle. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Qarth itself is hers, she has no need of baubles,” blue-lipped Pyat Pree sang out from her </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">other side. “It shall be as I promised, <i>Khaleesi</i>. Come with me to the House of the Undying, </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why should she need your Palace of Dust, when I can give her sunlight and sweet water </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and silks to sleep in?” Xaro said to the warlock. “The Thirteen shall set a crown of black jade </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="255" height="15" font="1">and fire opals upon her lovely head.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The only palace I desire is the red castle at King’s Landing, my lord Pyat.” Dany was </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">wary  of  the  warlock;  the  <i>maegi</i> Mirri Maz Duur had soured her on those who played at </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sorcery. “And if the great of Qarth would give me gifts, Xaro, let them give me ships and </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">swords to win back what is rightfully mine.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Pyat’s blue lips curled upward in a gracious smile. “It shall be as you command, </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Khaleesi</i>.” He moved away, swaying with his camel’s motion, his long beaded robes trailing </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">behind. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The young queen is wise beyond her years,” Xaro Xhoan Daxos murmured down at her </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from his high saddle. “There is a saying in Qarth. A warlock’s house is built of bones and </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="39" height="15" font="1">lies.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Then why do men lower their voices when they speak of the warlocks of Qarth? All </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">across the east, their power and wisdom are revered.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Once they were mighty,” Xaro agreed, “but now they are as ludicrous as those feeble </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">old soldiers who boast of their prowess long after strength and skill have left them. They read </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their crumbling scrolls, drink shade-of-the-evening until their lips turn blue, and hint of dread </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">powers, but they are hollow husks compared to those who went before. Pyat Pree’s gifts will </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">turn to dust in your hands, I warn you.” He gave his camel a lick of his whip and sped away. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“The crow calls the raven black,” muttered Ser Jorah in the Common Tongue of </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Westeros. The exile knight rode at her right hand, as ever. For their entrance into Qarth, he </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had put away his Dothraki garb and donned again the plate and mail and wool of the Seven </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">Kingdoms half a world away. “You would do well to avoid both those men, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“Those men will help me to my crown,” she said. “Xaro has vast wealth, and Pyat Pree—</text>

<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“—pretends to power,” the knight said brusquely. On his dark green surcoat, the bear of </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">House Mormont stood on its hind legs, black and fierce. Jorah looked no less ferocious as he </text>

<text top="906" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">the very smell of this place.” </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany smiled. “Perhaps it’s the camels you’re smelling. The Qartheen themselves seem </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">sweet enough to my nose.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Xaro Xhoan Daxos had offered Dany the hospitality of his home while she was in the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">city. She had expected something grand. She had not expected a palace larger than many a </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">market town. <i>It makes Magister Illyrio’s manse in Pentos look like a swineherd’s hovel</i>, she </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought. Xaro swore that his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">besides; indeed, it swallowed them. An entire wing was given over to her. She would have her </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">own gardens, a marble bathing pool, a scrying tower and warlock’s maze. Slaves would tend </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her every need. In her private chambers, the floors were green marble, the walls draped with </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">colorful silk hangings that shimmered with every breath of air. “You are too generous,” she </text>

<text top="285" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“For the Mother of Dragons, no gift is too great.” Xaro was a languid, elegant man with a </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bald head and a great beak of a nose crusted with rubies, opals, and flakes of jade. “On the </text>

<text top="368" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>All the great of Qarth will come to see my dragons</i>, Dany thought, yet she thanked Xaro </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">for his kindness before she sent him on his way. Pyat Pree took his leave as well, vowing to </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">petition the Undying Ones for an audience. “An honor rare as summer snows.” Before he left </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he kissed her bare feet with his pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift, a jar of ointment that </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">he swore would let her see the spirits of the air. Last of the three seekers to depart was </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Quaithe the shadowbinder. From her Dany received only a warning. “Beware,” the woman in </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="181" height="15" font="1">the red lacquer mask said. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="91" height="15" font="1">“Of whom?” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Of all. They shall come day and night to see the wonder that has been born again into </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the world, and when they see they shall lust. For dragons are fire made flesh, and fire is </text>

<text top="644" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I do not understand her.” Pyat and Xaro had showered Dany with promises from the </text>

<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but from Quaithe she had gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">never seen the woman’s face. <i>Remember Mirri Maz Duur</i>, she told herself. <i>Remember </i></text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>treachery.</i> She turned to her bloodriders. “We will keep our own watch so long as we are </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">here. See that no one enters this wing of the palace without my leave, and take care that the </text>

<text top="786" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“It shall be done, <i>Khaleesi</i>,” Aggo said. </text>
<text top="811" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We have seen only the parts of Qarth that Pyat Pree wished us to see,” she went on. </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“Rakharo, go forth and look on the rest, and tell me what you find. Take good men with </text>

<text top="875" left="171" width="365" height="15" font="1">“As you say, I do, blood of my blood,” said Rakharo. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ser Jorah, find the docks and see what manner of ships lay at anchor. It has been half a </text>

<text top="939" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">some good captain here from Westeros with a ship to carry us home.” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The knight frowned. “That would be no kindness. The Usurper will kill you, sure as </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">Reluctantly, the exile nodded. “As you say, my queen.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When all the men had gone, her handmaids stripped off the travel-stained silks she wore, </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico. The water was </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">deliciously cool, and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">skin and made her giggle. It felt good to close her eyes and float, knowing she could rest as </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">long as she liked. She wondered whether Aegon’s Red Keep had a pool like this, and fragrant </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gardens full of lavender and mint. <i>It must, surely. Viserys always said the Seven Kingdoms </i></text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="375" height="15" font="5"><i>were more beautiful than any other place in the world.</i> </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had lived, he would have led his </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>khalasar</i> across the poison water and swept away her enemies, but his strength had left the </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">world. Her bloodriders remained, sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ways of the horselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not rule </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them. Dany had no wish to reduce King’s Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She had supped enough on tears. <i>I want to make my kingdom beautiful, to fill it with fat men </i></text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>and pretty maids and laughing children. I want my people to smile when they see me ride by, </i></text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="321" height="15" font="5"><i>the way Viserys said they smiled for my father.</i> </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">But before she could do that she must conquer. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>The Usurper will kill you, sure as sunrise</i>, Mormont had said. Robert had slain her </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gallant brother Rhaegar, and one of his creatures had crossed the Dothraki sea to poison her </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and her unborn son. They said Robert Baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle, a </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">man who loved nothing better than war. And with him stood the great lords her brother had </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">named the Usurper’s dogs, cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart, and the golden </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">Lannisters, father and son, so rich, so powerful, so treacherous. </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">How could she hope to overthrow such men? When Khal Drogo had lived, men trembled </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and made him gifts to stay his wrath. If they did not, he took their cities, wealth and wives and </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all. But his <i>khalasar</i> had been vast, while hers was meager. Her people had followed her </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">across the red waste as she chased her comet, and would follow her across the poison water </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">too, but they would not be enough. Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys had </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">believed that the realm would rise for its rightful king . . . but Viserys had been a fool, and </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">fools believe in foolish things. </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Her doubts made her shiver. Suddenly the water felt cold to her, and the little fish </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">prickling at her skin annoying. Dany stood and climbed from the pool. “Irri,” she called, </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">“Jhiqui.” </text>
<text top="786" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As the handmaids toweled her dry and wrapped her in a sandsilk robe, Dany’s thoughts </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">went to the three who had sought her out in the City of Bones. <i>The Bleeding Star led me to </i></text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Qarth for a purpose. Here I will find what I need, if I have the strength to take what is offered, </i></text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>and the wisdom to avoid the traps and snares. If the gods mean for me to conquer, they will </i></text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="390" height="15" font="5"><i>provide, they will send me a sign, and if not . . . if not . . .</i> </text>
<text top="889" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was near evenfall and Dany was feeding her dragons when Irri stepped through the </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silken curtains to tell her that Ser Jorah had returned from the docks . . . and not alone. “Send </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="399" height="15" font="1">him in, with whomever he has brought,” she said, curious. </text>
<text top="953" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When they entered, she was seated on a mound of cushions, her dragons all about her. </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The man he brought with him wore a cloak of green and yellow feathers and had skin as black </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">as polished jet. “Your Grace,” the knight said, “I bring you Quhuru Mo, captain of the </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="288" height="15" font="5"><i>Cinnamon Wind</i> out of Tall Trees Town.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The black man knelt. “I am greatly honored, my queen,” he said; not in the tongue of the </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="624" height="15" font="1">Summer Isles, which Dany did not know, but in the liquid Valyrian of the Nine Free Cities. </text>

<page number="230" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The honor is mine, Quhuru Mo,” said Dany in the same language. “Have you come </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">from the Summer Isles?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“This is so, Your Grace, but before, not half a year past, we called at Oldtown. From </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">there I bring you a wondrous gift.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="67" height="15" font="1">“A gift?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="589" height="15" font="1">“A gift of news. Dragonmother, Stormborn, I tell you true, Robert Baratheon is dead.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Outside her walls, dusk was settling over Qarth, but a sun had risen in Dany’s heart. </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Dead?” she repeated. In her lap, black Drogon <i>hissed</i>, and pale smoke rose before her face </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="355" height="15" font="1">like a veil. “You are certain? The Usurper is dead?” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“So it is said in Oldtown, and Dorne, and Lys, and all the other ports where we have </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">called.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He sent me poisoned wine, yet I live and he is gone.</i> “What was the manner of his death?” </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">On her shoulder, pale Viserion flapped wings the color of cream, stirring the air. </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Torn by a monstrous boar whilst hunting in his kingswood, or so I heard in Oldtown. </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Others say his queen betrayed him, or his brother, or Lord Stark who was his Hand. Yet all </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="416" height="15" font="1">the tales agree in this: King Robert is dead and in his grave.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany had never looked upon the Usurper’s face, yet seldom a day had passed when she </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had not thought of him. His great shadow had lain across her since the hour of her birth, when </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she came forth amidst blood and storm into a world where she no longer had a place. And </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="325" height="15" font="1">now this ebony stranger had lifted that shadow. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="354" height="15" font="1">“The boy sits the Iron Throne now,” Ser Jorah said. </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“King Joffrey reigns,” Quhuru Mo agreed, “but the Lannisters rule. Robert’s brothers </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">have fled King’s Landing. The talk is, they mean to claim the crown. And the Hand has fallen, </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">Lord Stark who was King Robert’s friend. He has been seized for treason.” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Ned Stark a traitor?” Ser Jorah snorted. “Not bloody likely. The Long Summer will </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="442" height="15" font="1">come again before that one would besmirch his precious honor.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What honor could he have?” Dany said. “He was a traitor to his true king, as were these </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lannisters.” It pleased her to hear that the Usurper’s dogs were fighting amongst themselves, </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">though she was unsurprised. The same thing happened when her Drogo died, and his great </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>khalasar</i> tore itself to pieces. “My brother is dead as well, Viserys who was the true king,” </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she told the Summer Islander. “Khal Drogo my lord husband killed him with a crown of </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">molten gold.” Would her brother have been any wiser, had he known that the vengeance he </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">had prayed for was so close at hand? </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then I grieve for you, Dragonmother, and for bleeding Westeros, bereft of its rightful </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">king.” </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beneath Dany’s gentle fingers, green Rhaegal stared at the stranger with eyes of molten </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gold. When his mouth opened, his teeth gleamed like black needles. “When does your ship </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">return to Westeros, Captain?” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Not for a year or more, I fear. From here the <i>Cinnamon Wind</i> sails east, to make the </text>

<text top="973" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I see,” said Dany, disappointed. “I wish you fair winds and good trading, then. You </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">have brought me a precious gift.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="282" height="15" font="1">“I have been amply repaid, great queen.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="216" height="15" font="1">She puzzled at that. “How so?” </text>
<text top="1068" left="171" width="285" height="15" font="1">His eyes gleamed. “I have seen dragons.” </text>

<page number="231" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Dany laughed. “And will see more of them one day, I hope. Come to me in King’s </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Summer Islander promised he would do so, and kissed her lightly on the fingers as </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="534" height="15" font="1">he took his leave. Jhiqui showed him out, while Ser Jorah Mormont remained. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Khaleesi</i>,” the knight said when they were alone, “I should not speak so freely of your </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let him,” she said. “Let the whole world know my purpose. The Usurper is dead, what </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">does it matter?” </text>

<text top="915" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yai!” the girl shouted, the spear darting out. The wolf slid to the left and leapt before </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she could draw back the spear. Meera cast her net, the tangles unfolding in the air before her. </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Summer’s leap carried him into it. He dragged it with him as he slammed into her chest and </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knocked her over backward. Her spear went spinning away. The damp grass cushioned her </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="514" height="15" font="1">fall but the breath went out of her in an “Oof.” The wolf crouched atop her. </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">Bran hooted. “You lose.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He was right, Bran saw. Thrashing and growling at the net, trying to rip free, Summer </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="525" height="15" font="1">was only ensnaring himself worse. Nor could he bite through. “Let him out.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Laughing, the Reed girl threw her arms around the tangled wolf and rolled them both. </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Summer gave a piteous whine, his legs kicking against the cords that bound them. Meera </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knelt, undid a twist, pulled at a corner, tugged deftly here and there, and suddenly the direwolf </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">was bounding free. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Summer, to me.” Bran spread his arms. “Watch,” he said, an instant before the wolf </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bowled into him. He clung with all his strength as the wolf dragged him bumping through the </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grass. They wrestled and rolled and clung to each other, one snarling and yapping, the other </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">laughing. In the end it was Bran sprawled on top, the mud-spattered direwolf under him. </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">“Good wolf,” he panted. Summer licked him across the ear. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="364" height="15" font="1">Meera shook her head. “Does he never grow angry?” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Not with me.” Bran grabbed the wolf by his ears and Summer snapped at him fiercely, </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">but it was all in play. “Sometimes he tears my garb but he’s never drawn blood.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="378" height="15" font="1">“<i>Your</i> blood, you mean. If he’d gotten past my net . . .” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He wouldn’t hurt you. He knows I like you.” All of the other lords and knights had </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">departed within a day or two of the harvest feast, but the Reeds had stayed to become Bran’s </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">constant companions. Jojen was so solemn that Old Nan called him “little grandfather,” but </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Meera reminded Bran of his sister Arya. She wasn’t scared to get dirty, and she could run and </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fight and throw as good as a boy. She was older than Arya, though; almost sixteen, a woman </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grown. They were both older than Bran, even though his ninth name day had finally come and </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">gone, but they never treated him like a child. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I wish you were our wards instead of the Walders.” He began to struggle toward the </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">nearest tree. His dragging and wriggling was unseemly to watch, but when Meera moved to </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lift him he said, “No, don’t help me.” He rolled clumsily and pushed and squirmed backward, </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">using the strength of his arms, until he was sitting with his back to the trunk of a tall ash. </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“See, I told you.” Summer lay down with his head in Bran’s lap. “I never knew anyone who </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fought with a net before,” he told Meera while he scratched the direwolf between the ears. </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="347" height="15" font="1">“Did your master-at-arms teach you net-fighting?” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My father taught me. We have no knights at Greywater. No master-at-arms, and no </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">maester.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="186" height="15" font="1">“Who keeps your ravens?” </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="562" height="15" font="1">She smiled. “Ravens can’t find Greywater Watch, no more than our enemies can.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="86" height="15" font="1">“Why not?” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="234" height="15" font="1">“Because it moves,” she told him. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Bran had never heard of a moving castle before. He looked at her uncertainly, but he </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">couldn’t tell whether she was teasing him or not. “I wish I could see it. Do you think your lord </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="371" height="15" font="1">father would let me come visit when the war is over?” </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="394" height="15" font="1">“You would be most welcome, my prince. Then or now.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Now?</i>” Bran had spent his whole life at Winterfell. He yearned to see far places. “I </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could ask Ser Rodrik when he returns.” The old knight was off east, trying to set to rights the </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trouble there. Roose Bolton’s bastard had started it by seizing Lady Hornwood as she returned </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from the harvest feast, marrying her that very night even though he was young enough to be </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her son. Then Lord Manderly had taken her castle. To protect the Hornwood holdings from </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Boltons, he had written, but Ser Rodrik had been almost as angry with him as with the </text>
<text top="1065" left="139" width="466" height="15" font="1">bastard. “Ser Rodrik might let me go. Maester Luwin never would.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sitting cross-legged under the weirwood, Jojen Reed regarded him solemnly. “It would </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">be good if you left Winterfell, Bran.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="84" height="15" font="1">“It would?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“Yes. And sooner rather than later.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My brother has the greensight,” said Meera. “He dreams things that haven’t happened, </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">but sometimes they do.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="573" height="15" font="1">“There is no <i>sometimes</i>, Meera.” A look passed between them; him sad, her defiant. </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">“Tell me what’s going to happen,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“I will,” said Jojen, “if you’ll tell me about your dreams.” </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The godswood grew quiet. Bran could hear leaves rustling, and Hodor’s distant splashing </text>
<text top="338" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from the hot pools. He thought of the golden man and the three-eyed crow, remembered the </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">crunch of bones between his jaws and the coppery taste of blood. “I don’t have dreams. </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin gives me sleeping draughts.” </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="114" height="15" font="1">“Do they help?” </text>
<text top="428" left="171" width="99" height="15" font="1">“Sometimes.” </text>
<text top="453" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Meera said, “All of Winterfell knows you wake at night shouting and sweating, Bran. </text>
<text top="472" left="139" width="422" height="15" font="1">The women talk of it at the well, and the guards in their hall.” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="338" height="15" font="1">“Tell us what frightens you so much,” said Jojen. </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I don’t want to. Anyway, it’s only dreams. Maester Luwin says dreams might mean </text>
<text top="542" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">anything or nothing.” </text>
<text top="567" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My brother dreams as other boys do, and those dreams might mean anything,” Meera </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="288" height="15" font="1">said, “but the green dreams are different.” </text>
<text top="612" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jojen’s eyes were the color of moss, and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to </text>
<text top="631" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">be seeing something else. Like now. “I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stone chains,” he said. “It was a green dream, so I knew it was true. A crow was trying to </text>
<text top="670" left="139" width="616" height="15" font="1">peck through the chains, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="224" height="15" font="1">“Did the crow have three eyes?” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="98" height="15" font="1">Jojen nodded. </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Summer raised his head from Bran’s lap, and gazed at the mudman with his dark golden </text>
<text top="765" left="139" width="39" height="15" font="1">eyes. </text>
<text top="790" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“When I was little I almost died of greywater fever. That was when the crow came to </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="835" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He came to me after I fell,” Bran blurted. “I was asleep for a long time. He said I had to </text>
<text top="854" left="139" width="492" height="15" font="1">fly or die, and I woke up, only I was broken and I couldn’t fly after all.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You can if you want to.” Picking up her net, Meera shook out the last tangles and began </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">arranging it in loose folds. </text>
<text top="924" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>You</i> are the winged wolf, Bran,” said Jojen. “I wasn’t sure when we first came, but now </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="346" height="15" font="1">I am. The crow sent us here to break your chains.” </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="194" height="15" font="1">“Is the crow at Greywater?” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“No. The crow is in the north.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“At the Wall?” Bran had always wanted to see the Wall. His bastard brother Jon was </text>
<text top="1038" left="139" width="272" height="15" font="1">there now, a man of the Night’s Watch. </text>
</page>
<page number="234" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Beyond the Wall.” Meera Reed hung the net from her belt. “When Jojen told our lord </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">father what he’d dreamed, he sent us to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“How would I break the chains, Jojen?” Bran asked. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="123" height="15" font="1">“Open your eye.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="224" height="15" font="1">“They <i>are</i> open Can’t you <i>see?</i>” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“Two are open.” Jojen pointed. “One, two.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="129" height="15" font="1">“I only <i>have</i> two.” </text>
<text top="274" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You have three. The crow gave you the third, but you will not open it.” He had a slow </text>
<text top="294" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">soft way of speaking. “With two eyes you see my face. With three you could see my heart. </text>
<text top="313" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">With two you can see that oak tree there. With three you could see the acorn the oak grew </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from and the stump that it will one day become. With two you see no farther than your walls. </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="558" height="15" font="1">With three you would gaze south to the Summer Sea and north beyond the Wall.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Summer got to his feet. “I don’t need to see so far.” Bran made a nervous smile. “I’m </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tired of talking about crows. Let’s talk about wolves. Or lizard-lions. Have you ever hunted </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">one, Meera? We don’t have them here.” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Meera plucked her frog spear out of the bushes. “They live in the water. In slow streams </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="148" height="15" font="1">and deep swamps—” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">Her brother interrupted. “Did you dream of a lizard-lion?” </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="310" height="15" font="1">“No,” said Bran. “I told you, I don’t want—” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="194" height="15" font="1">“Did you dream of a wolf?” </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He was making Bran angry. “I don’t have to tell you my dreams. I’m the prince. I’m the </text>
<text top="581" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">Stark in Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="606" left="171" width="132" height="15" font="1">“Was it Summer?” </text>
<text top="631" left="171" width="111" height="15" font="1">“You be quiet.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The night of the harvest feast, you dreamed you were Summer in the godswood, didn’t </text>
<text top="676" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">you?” </text>
<text top="701" left="171" width="559" height="15" font="1">“<i>Stop it!</i>” Bran shouted. Summer slid toward the weirwood, his white teeth bared. </text>
<text top="726" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jojen Reed took no mind. “When I touched Summer, I felt you in him. Just as you are in </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">him now.” </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="346" height="15" font="1">“You couldn’t have. I was in bed. I was sleeping.” </text>
<text top="796" left="171" width="283" height="15" font="1">“You were in the godswood, all in grey.” </text>
<text top="821" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“It was only a bad dream . . .” </text>
<text top="846" left="171" width="512" height="15" font="1">Jojen stood. “I felt you. I felt you fall. Is that what scares you, the falling?” </text>

<text top="999" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A low rumbling growl rose from Summer’s throat, and there was no play in it. He stalked </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">forward, all teeth and hot eyes. Meera stepped between the wolf and her brother, spear in </text>

<text top="129" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">“It’s your anger, Bran,” her brother said. “Your fear.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It isn’t. I’m not a wolf.” Yet he’d howled with them in the night, and tasted blood in his </text>

<text top="199" left="171" width="515" height="15" font="1">“Part of you is Summer, and part of Summer is you. You know that, Bran.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Summer rushed forward, but Meera blocked him, jabbing with the three-pronged spear. </text>
<text top="243" left="139" width="624" height="15" font="1">The wolf twisted aside, circling, stalking. Meera turned to face him. “Call him back, Bran.” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Summer!” Bran shouted. “To me, Summer!” He slapped an open palm down on the </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">meat of his thigh. His hand tingled, though his dead leg felt nothing. </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The direwolf lunged again, and again Meera’s spear darted out. Summer dodged, circled </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back. The bushes rustled, and a lean black shape came padding from behind the weirwood, </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">teeth bared. The scent was strong; his brother had smelled his rage. Bran felt hairs rise on the </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back of his neck. Meera stood beside her brother, with wolves to either side. “Bran, call them </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="36" height="15" font="1">off.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="70" height="15" font="1">“I <i>can’t!</i>” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="139" height="15" font="1">“Jojen, up the tree.” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“There’s no need. Today is not the day I die.” </text>
<text top="492" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“<i>Do it!</i>” she screamed, and her brother scrambled up the trunk of the weirwood, using the </text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">face for his handholds. The direwolves closed. Meera abandoned spear and net, jumped up, </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and grabbed the branch above her head. Shaggy’s jaws snapped shut beneath her ankle as she </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swung up and over the limb. Summer sat back on his haunches and howled, while Shaggydog </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">worried the net, shaking it in his teeth. </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Only then did Bran remember that they were not alone. He cupped hands around his </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">mouth. “Hodor!” he shouted. “<i>Hodor! Hodor!</i>” He was badly frightened and somehow </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="442" height="15" font="1">ashamed. “They won’t hurt Hodor,” he assured his treed friends. </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">A few moments passed before they heard a tuneless humming. Hodor arrived half-</text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dressed and mud-spattered from his visit to the hot pools, but Bran had never been so glad to </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">see him. “Hodor, help me. Chase off the wolves. Chase them off.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hodor went to it gleefully, waving his arms and stamping his huge feet, shouting “Hodor, </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Hodor,” running first at one wolf and then the other. Shaggydog was the first to flee, slinking </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back into the foliage with a final snarl. When Summer had enough, he came back to Bran and </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="149" height="15" font="1">lay down beside him. </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No sooner did Meera touch ground than she snatched up her spear and net again. Jojen </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">never took his eyes off Summer. “We will talk again,” he promised Bran. </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>It was the wolves, it wasn’t me.</i> He did not understand why they’d gotten so wild. <i>Maybe </i></text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>Maester Luwin was right to lock them in the godswood.</i> “Hodor,” he said, “bring me to </text>

<text top="915" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The maester’s turret below the rookery was one of Bran’s favorite places. Luwin was </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">hopelessly untidy, but his clutter of books and scrolls and bottles was as familiar and </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">comforting to Bran as his bald spot and the flapping sleeves of his loose grey robes. He liked </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">the ravens too. </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He found Luwin perched on a high stool, writing. With Ser Rodrik gone, all of the </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">governance of the castle had fallen on his shoulders. “My prince,” he said when Hodor </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">entered, “you’re early for lessons today.” The maester spent several hours every afternoon </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">tutoring Bran, Rickon, and the Walder Freys. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Hodor, stand still.” Bran grasped a wall sconce with both hands and used it to pull </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself up and out of the basket. He hung for a moment by his arms until Hodor carried him </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">to a chair. “Meera says her brother has the greensight.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="599" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin scratched at the side of his nose with his writing quill. “Does she now?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="606" height="15" font="1">He nodded. “You told me that the children of the forest had the greensight. I remember.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="523" height="15" font="1">“Some claimed to have that power. Their wise men were called <i>greenseers</i>.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="116" height="15" font="1">“Was it magic?” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Call it that for want of a better word, if you must. At heart it was only a different sort of </text>

<text top="313" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“What was it?” </text>
<text top="338" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Luwin set down his quill. “No one truly knows, Bran. The children are gone from the </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">world, and their wisdom with them. It had to do with the faces in the trees, we think. The First </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Men believed that the greenseers could see through the eyes of the weirwoods. That was why </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they cut down the trees whenever they warred upon the children. Supposedly the greenseers </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">also had power over the beasts of the wood and the birds in the trees. Even fish. Does the </text>

<text top="461" left="171" width="533" height="15" font="1">“No. I don’t think. But he has dreams that come true sometimes, Meera says.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“All of us have dreams that come true sometimes. You dreamed of your lord father in the </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="337" height="15" font="1">crypts before we knew he was dead, remember?” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="329" height="15" font="1">“Rickon did too. We dreamed the same dream.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Call it greensight, if you wish . . . but remember as well all those tens of thousands of </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dreams that you and Rickon have dreamed that did <i>not</i> come true. Do you perchance recall </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">what I taught you about the chain collar that every maester wears?” </text>
<text top="620" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Bran thought for a moment, trying to remember. “A maester forges his chain in the </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Citadel of Oldtown. It’s a chain because you swear to serve, and it’s made of different metals </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">because you serve the realm and the realm has different sorts of people. Every time you learn </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">something you get another link. Black iron is for ravenry, silver for healing, gold for sums and </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">numbers. I don’t remember them all.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Luwin slid a finger up under his collar and began to turn it, inch by inch. He had a thick </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">neck for a small man, and the chain was tight, but a few pulls had it all the way around. “This </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">is Valyrian steel,” he said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of his throat. </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Only one maester in a hundred wears such a link. This signifies that I have studied what the </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Citadel calls <i>the higher mysteries</i>—magic, for want of a better word. A fascinating pursuit, </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="1">but of small use, which is why so few maesters trouble themselves with it.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“All those who study the higher mysteries try their own hand at spells, soon or late. I </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yielded to the temptation too, I must confess it. Well, I was a boy, and what boy does not </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">secretly wish to find hidden powers in himself? I got no more for my efforts than a thousand </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">boys before me, and a thousand since. Sad to say, magic does not work.” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sometimes it does,” Bran protested. “I had that dream, and Rickon did too. And there </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="272" height="15" font="1">are mages and warlocks in the east . . .” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There are men who <i>call</i> themselves mages and warlocks,” Maester Luwin said. “I had a </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">friend at the Citadel who could pull a rose out of your ear, but he was no more magical than I </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was. Oh, to be sure, there is much we do not understand. The years pass in their hundreds and </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their thousands, and what does any man see of life but a few summers, a few winters? We </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mountains rise and fall, rivers change their courses, stars fall from the sky, and great cities </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="466" height="15" font="1">sink beneath the sea. Even gods die, we think. Everything changes.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps magic was once a mighty force in the world, but no longer. What little remains </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">is no more than the wisp of smoke that lingers in the air after a great fire has burned out, and </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">even that is fading. Valyria was the last ember, and Valyria is gone. The dragons are no more, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">the giants are dead, the children of the forest forgotten with all their lore.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No, my prince. Jojen Reed may have had a dream or two that he believes came true, but </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">he does not have the greensight. No living man has that power.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran said as much to Meera Reed when she came to him at dusk as he sat in his window </text>

<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shouldn’t have tried to hurt Jojen, but Jojen shouldn’t have said all that about my dreams. The </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="424" height="15" font="1">crow lied when he said I could fly, and your brother lied too.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="254" height="15" font="1">“Or perhaps your maester is wrong.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">“He isn’t. Even my father relied on his counsel.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your father listened, I have no doubt. But in the end, he decided for himself. Bran, will </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="590" height="15" font="1">you let me tell you about a dream Jojen dreamed of you and your fosterling brothers?” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="240" height="15" font="1">“The Walders aren’t my brothers.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She paid that no heed. “You were sitting at supper, but instead of a servant, Maester </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Luwin brought you your food. He served you the king’s cut off the roast, the meat rare and </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bloody, but with a savory smell that made everyone’s mouth water. The meat he served the </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="613" height="15" font="1">Freys was old and grey and dead. Yet they liked their supper better than you liked yours.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="148" height="15" font="1">“I don’t understand.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="414" height="15" font="1">“You will, my brother says. When you do, we’ll talk again.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran was almost afraid to sit to supper that night, but when he did, it was pigeon pie they </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">set before him. Everyone else was served the same, and he couldn’t see that anything was </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wrong with the food they served the Walders. <i>Maester Luwin has the truth of it</i>, he told </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">himself. Nothing bad was coming to Winterfell, no matter what Jojen said. Bran was </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">relieved . . . but disappointed too. So long as there was magic, anything could happen. Ghosts </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could walk, trees could talk, and broken boys could grow up to be knights. “But there isn’t,” </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="1">he said aloud in the darkness of his bed. “There’s no magic, and the stories are just stories.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="348" height="15" font="1">And he would never walk, nor fly, nor be a knight. </text>

<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Pycelle.” Ser Lancel showed Tyrion a crimson ribbon, bearing Cersei’s lion seal impressed in </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">golden wax. “Here is her warrant.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“So it is.” Tyrion waved it away. “I hope my sister is not overtaxing her strength, so soon </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">after her illness. It would be a great pity if she were to suffer a relapse.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="375" height="15" font="1">“Her Grace is quite recovered,” Ser Lancel said curtly. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Music to my ears.” <i>Though not a tune I’m fond of. I should have given her a larger </i></text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>dose.</i> Tyrion had hoped for a few more days without Cersei’s interference, but he was not too </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">terribly surprised by her return to health. She was Jaime’s twin, after all. He made himself </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smile pleasantly. “Pod, build us a fire, the air is too chilly for my taste. Will you take a cup </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="397" height="15" font="1">with me, Lancel? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I need no help sleeping,” Ser Lancel said. “I am come at Her Grace’s behest, not to </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">drink with you, Imp.” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Knighthood had made the boy bolder, Tyrion reflected—that, and the sorry part he had </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">played in murdering King Robert. “Wine does have its dangers.” He smiled as he poured. “As </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to Grand Maester Pycelle . . . if my sweet sister is so concerned for him, I would have thought </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="489" height="15" font="1">she’d come herself. Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Make of it what you will, so long as you release your prisoner. The Grand Maester is a </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">staunch friend to the Queen Regent, and under her personal protection.” A hint of a sneer </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">played about the lad’s lips; he was enjoying this. <i>He takes his lessons from Cersei.</i> “Her </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="591" height="15" font="1">Grace will never consent to this outrage. She reminds you that she is Joffrey’s regent.” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="182" height="15" font="1">“As I am Joffrey’s Hand.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The Hand serves,” the young knight informed him airily. “The regent <i>rules</i> until the </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">king is of age.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps you ought write that down so I’ll remember it better.” The fire was crackling </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">merrily. “You may leave us, Pod,” Tyrion told his squire. Only when the boy was gone did he </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">turn back to Lancel. “There is more?” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes. Her Grace bids me inform you that Ser Jacelyn Bywater defied a command issued </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">in the king’s own name.” </text>
<text top="918" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>Which means that Cersei has already ordered Bywater to release Pycelle, and been </i></text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="5"><i>rebuffed.</i> “I see.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She insists that the man be removed from his office and placed under arrest for treason. </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="102" height="15" font="1">I warn you—” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="446" height="15" font="1">He set aside his wine cup. “I’ll hear no warnings from you, boy.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ser</i>,” Lancel said stiffly. He touched his sword, perhaps to remind Tyrion that he wore </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one. “Have a care how you speak to me, Imp.” Doubtless he meant to sound threatening, but </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="1">that absurd wisp of a mustache ruined the effect. </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lancel reddened; was he such a fool as to believe his part in Robert’s death had gone </text>

<text top="620" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The defiance went from Lancel all at once. The young knight fell to his knees a </text>

<text top="664" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“Save it for Joffrey. He likes a good beg.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My lord, it was your sister’s bidding, the queen, as you said, but His Grace . . . he’d </text>

<text top="957" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lord.” Lancel spoke without a moment’s hesitation. Tyrion liked that. “I will. I </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="272" height="15" font="1">“You will?” Lancel seemed astonished. </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion smiled. “I’ll release him on the morrow. I could swear that I hadn’t harmed a hair </text>

<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">vouch for his vigor. The black cells are not a healthy place for a man his age. Cersei can keep </text>

<text top="347" left="171" width="138" height="15" font="1">“And Ser Jacelyn?” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Tell my sister you believe you can win him away from me, given time. That ought to </text>

<text top="416" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“As you say.” Lancel finished his wine. </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“One last thing. With King Robert dead, it would be most embarrassing should his </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="338" height="15" font="1">grieving widow suddenly grow great with child.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My  lord,  I . . . we . . . the  queen  has  commanded  me  not  to . . .”  His  ears  had  turned </text>

<text top="575" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">Ser Lancel made a stiff bow and took his leave. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion allowed himself a moment to feel sorry for the boy. <i>Another fool, and a weakling </i></text>
<text top="620" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>as well, but he does not deserve what Cersei and I are doing to him.</i> It was a kindness that his </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">uncle Kevan had two other sons; this one was unlikely to live out the year. Cersei would have </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him killed out of hand if she learned he was betraying her, and if by some grace of the gods </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she did not, Lancel would never survive the day Jaime Lannister returned to King’s Landing. </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">The only question would be whether Jaime cut him down in a jealous rage, or Cersei </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">murdered him first to keep Jaime from finding out. Tyrion’s silver was on Cersei. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A restlessness was on him, and Tyrion knew full well he would not get back to sleep </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tonight. <i>Not here, in any case.</i> He found Podrick Payne asleep in a chair outside the door of </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the solar, and shook him by the shoulder. “Summon Bronn, and then run down to the stables </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">and have two horses saddled.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">The squire’s eyes were cloudy with sleep. “Horses.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Those big brown animals that love apples, I’m sure you’ve seen them. Four legs and a </text>

<text top="895" left="171" width="577" height="15" font="1">The sellsword was not long in appearing. “Who pissed in your soup?” he demanded. </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Cersei, as ever. You’d think I’d be used to the taste by now, but never mind. My gentle </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The city streets were dangerous, but with Bronn beside him Tyrion felt safe enough. The </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">guards let him out a postern gate in the north wall, and they rode down Shadowblack Lane to </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the foot of Aegon’s High Hill, and thence onto Pigrun Alley, past rows of shuttered windows </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and tall timber-and-stone buildings whose upper stories leaned out so far over the street they </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">almost kissed. The moon seemed to follow them as they went, playing peek-and-sneak among </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the chimneys. They encountered no one but a lone old crone, carrying a dead cat by the tail. </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">She gave them a fearful look, as if she were afraid they might try to steal her dinner, and slunk </text>

<text top="265" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion reflected on the men who had been Hand before him, who had proved no match </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">for his sister’s wiles. <i>How could they be? Men like that . . . too honest to live, too noble to </i></text>

<text top="407" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Despite the hour, the brothel was crowded. Chataya greeted them pleasantly and escorted </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">them to the common room. Bronn went upstairs with a dark-eyed girl from Dorne, but </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Alayaya was busy entertaining. “She will be so pleased to know you’ve come,” said Chataya. </text>

<text top="510" left="171" width="116" height="15" font="1">“I will,” he said. </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The wine was poor stuff compared to the vintages from the Arbor the house normally </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">served. “You must forgive us, my lord,” Chataya said. “I cannot find good wine at any price </text>

<text top="600" left="171" width="236" height="15" font="1">“You are not alone in that, I fear.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Chataya commiserated with him a moment, then excused herself and glided off. <i>A </i></text>

<text top="728" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A few of the other patrons were giving him sideways looks. The last time he ventured </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">out, a man had spit on him . . . well, had tried to. Instead he’d spit on Bronn, and in future </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">would do his spitting without teeth. </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Is milord feeling unloved?” Dancy slid into his lap and nibbled at his ear. “I have a cure </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">for that.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Smiling, Tyrion shook his head. “You are too beautiful for words, sweetling, but I’ve </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">grown fond of Alayaya’s remedy.” </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You’ve never <i>tried</i> mine. Milord never chooses anyone but ‘Yaya. She’s good but I’m </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">better, don’t you want to see?” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Next time, perhaps.” Tyrion had no doubt that Dancy would be a lively handful. She </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was pug-nosed and bouncy, with freckles and a mane of thick red hair that tumbled down past </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="388" height="15" font="1">her waist. But he had Shae waiting for him at the manse. </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Giggling, she put her hand between his thighs and squeezed him through his breeches. “I </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">don’t think <i>he</i> wants to wait till next time,” she announced. “He wants to come out and count </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Dancy.” Alayaya stood in the doorway, dark and cool in gauzy green silk. “His lordship </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">is come to visit me.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion gently disentangled himself from the other girl and stood. Dancy did not seem to </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">mind. “Next time,” she reminded him. She put a finger in her mouth and sucked it. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">As the black-skinned girl led him up the stairs, she said, “Poor Dancy. She has a fortnight </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">to get my lord to choose her. Elsewise she loses her black pearls to Marei.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Marei was a cool, pale, delicate girl Tyrion had noticed once or twice. Green eyes and </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">porcelain skin, long straight silvery hair, very lovely, but too solemn by half. “I’d hate to have </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="1">the poor child lose her pearls on account of me.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="241" height="15" font="1">“Then take her upstairs next time.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="111" height="15" font="1">“Maybe I will.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="239" height="15" font="1">She smiled. “I think not, my lord.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>She’s right</i>, Tyrion thought, <i>I won’t. Shae may be only a whore, but I am faithful to her </i></text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="5"><i>after my fashion.</i> </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">In the turret room, as he opened the door of the wardrobe, he looked at Alayaya </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">curiously. “What do you do while I’m gone?” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She raised her arms and stretched like some sleek black cat. “Sleep. I am much better </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rested since you began to visit us, my lord. And Marei is teaching us to read, perhaps soon I </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="289" height="15" font="1">will be able to pass the time with a book.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Sleep is good,” he said. “And books are better.” He gave her a quick kiss on the cheek. </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">Then it was down the shaft and through the tunnel. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">As he left the stable on his piebald gelding, Tyrion heard the sound of music drifting over </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the rooftops. It was pleasant to think that men still sang, even in the midst of butchery and </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">famine. Remembered notes filled his head, and for a moment he could almost hear Tysha as </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she’d sung to him half a lifetime ago. He reined up to listen. The tune was wrong, the words </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">too faint to hear. A different song then, and why not? His sweet innocent Tysha had been a lie </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">start to finish, only a whore his brother Jaime had hired to make him a man. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I’m free of Tysha now</i>, he thought. <i>She’s haunted me half my life, but I don’t need her </i></text>

<text top="737" left="139" width="352" height="15" font="5"><i>bedded with over the years. I have Shae now. Shae.</i> </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The gates of the manse were closed and barred. Tyrion pounded until the ornate bronze </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eye clacked open. “It’s me.” The man who admitted him was one of Varys’s prettier finds, a </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Braavosi daggerman with a harelip and a lazy eye. Tyrion had wanted no handsome young </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">guardsmen loitering about Shae day after day. “Find me old, ugly, scarred men, preferably </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">impotent,” he had told the eunuch. “Men who prefer boys. Or men who prefer sheep, for that </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">matter.” Varys had not managed to come up with any sheeplovers, but he did find a eunuch </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">strangler and a pair of foul-smelling Ibbenese who were as fond of axes as they were of each </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">other. The others were as choice a lot of mercenaries as ever graced a dungeon, each uglier </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than the last. When Varys had paraded them before him, Tyrion had been afraid he’d gone too </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">far, but Shae had never uttered a word of complaint. <i>And why would she? She has never </i></text>
<text top="957" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>complained of me, and I’m more hideous than all her guards together. Perhaps she does not </i></text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="5"><i>even see ugliness.</i> </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Even so, Tyrion would sooner have used some of his mountain clansmen to guard the </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">manse; Chella’s Black Ears perhaps, or the Moon Brothers. He had more faith in their iron </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">loyalties and sense of honor than in the greed of sellswords. The risk was too great, however. </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="539" height="15" font="1">One of the Ibbenese took his horse. “Have you woken her?” Tyrion asked him. </text>

<text top="243" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Shae had kicked off her blankets and sheets as she slept. She lay nude atop the featherbed, the </text>

<text top="321" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">innocent, he wondered? </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He had not intended to disturb her, but the sight of her was enough to make him hard. He </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">let his garments fall to the floor, then crawled onto the bed and gently pushed her legs apart </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and kissed her between the thighs. Shae murmured in her sleep. He kissed her again, and </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">licked at her secret sweetness, on and on until his beard and her cunt were both soaked. When </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">she gave a soft moan and shuddered, he climbed up and thrust himself inside her and </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="173" height="15" font="1">exploded almost at once. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her eyes were open. She smiled and stroked his head and whispered, “I just had the </text>

<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ghosts, and Kingspyre Tower. Arya slept in a shallow niche in the cavernous vaults beneath </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Wailing Tower, on a bed of straw. She had water to wash in whenever she liked, a chunk </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of soap. The work was hard, but no harder than walking miles every day. Weasel did not need </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to find worms and bugs to eat, as Arry had; there was bread every day, and barley stews with </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">bits of carrot and turnip, and once a fortnight even a bite of meat. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie ate even better; he was where he belonged, in the kitchens, a round stone </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">building with a domed roof that was a world unto itself. Arya took her meals at a trestle table </text>

<text top="995" left="139" width="539" height="15" font="1">the cooks saw. They took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon. </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Gendry had been sent to the forge; Arya seldom saw him. As for those she served with, </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she did not even want to know their names. That only made it hurt worse when they died. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal was vast, much of it far gone in decay. Lady Whent had held the castle as </text>

<text top="343" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">made fit for habitation again. There were floors to be scrubbed, grime to be washed off </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">windows, broken chairs and rotted beds to be carried off. The topmost story was infested with </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nests of the huge black bats that House Whent had used for its sigil, and there were rats in the </text>

<text top="588" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She wondered what Lord Tywin would do if she marched up to him and confessed to </text>

<text top="627" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">never believe her if she did, and afterward Weese would beat her bloody. </text>
<text top="652" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In his own small strutting way, Weese was nearly as scary as Ser Gregor. The Mountain </text>

<text top="794" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It took him only three days to earn the place of honor in her nightly prayers. “Weese,” </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she would whisper, first of all. “Dunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="494" height="15" font="1">the stories Old Nan used to tell of the giants who lived beyond the Wall. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And as lords and ladies never notice the little grey mice under their feet, Arya heard all </text>

<text top="324" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bastard and not the rightful king at all. “Lord Tywin told him to burn the letter and never </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="294" height="15" font="1">speak such filth again,” the girl whispered. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">King Robert’s brothers Stannis and Renly had joined the fighting, she heard. “And both </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of them kings now,” Weese said. “Realm’s got more kings than a castle’s got rats.” Even </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lannister men questioned how long Joffrey would hold the Iron Throne. “The lad’s got no </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">army but them gold cloaks, and he’s ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf, and a woman,” she heard a </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lordling mutter in his cups. “What good will the likes of them be if it comes to battle?” There </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was always talk of Beric Dondarrion. A fat archer once said the Bloody Mummers had slain </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him, but the others only laughed. “Lorch killed the man at Rushing Falls, and the Mountain’s </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="539" height="15" font="1">slain him twice. Got me a silver stag says he don’t stay dead this time neither.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya did not know who Bloody Mummers were until a fortnight later, when the queerest </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">company of men she’d ever seen arrived at Harrenhal. Beneath the standard of a black goat </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">with bloody horns rode copper men with bells in their braids; lancers astride striped black-</text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and-white horses; bowmen with powdered cheeks; squat hairy men with shaggy shields; </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brown-skinned men in feathered cloaks; a wispy fool in green-and-pink motley; swordsmen </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with fantastic forked beards dyed green and purple and silver; spearmen with colored scars </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that covered their cheeks; a slender man in septon’s robes, a fatherly one in maester’s grey, </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="483" height="15" font="1">and a sickly one whose leather cloak was fringed with long blond hair. </text>
<text top="691" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">At their head was a man stick-thin and very tall, with a drawn emaciated face made even </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">longer by the ropy black beard that grew from his pointed chin nearly to his waist. The helm </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that hung from his saddle horn was black steel, fashioned in the shape of a goat’s head. About </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his neck he wore a chain made of linked coins of many different sizes, shapes, and metals, </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="403" height="15" font="1">and his horse was one of the strange black-and-white ones. </text>
<text top="794" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You don’t want to know that lot, Weasel,” Weese said when he saw her looking at the </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">goat-helmed man. Two of his drinking friends were with him, men-at-arms in service to Lord </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">Lefford. </text>
<text top="858" left="171" width="192" height="15" font="1">“Who are they?” she asked. </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One of the soldiers laughed. “The Footmen, girl. Toes of the Goat. Lord Tywin’s Bloody </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="86" height="15" font="1">Mummers.” </text>
<text top="928" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Pease for wits. You get her flayed, <i>you</i> can scrub the bloody steps,” said Weese. </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“They’re sellswords, Weasel girl. Call themselves the Brave Companions. Don’t use them </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">other names where they can hear, or they’ll hurt you bad. The goat-helm’s their captain, Lord </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">Vargo Hoat.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He’s no fucking lord,” said the second soldier. “I heard Ser Amory say so. He’s just </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="512" height="15" font="1">some sellsword with a mouth full of slobber and a high opinion of hisself.” </text>
<text top="1056" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” said Weese, “but she better <i>call</i> him lord if she wants to keep all her parts.” </text>

<page number="246" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="539" height="15" font="1">Arya looked at Vargo Hoat again. <i>How many monsters does Lord Tywin have?</i> </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The Brave Companions were housed in the Widow’s Tower, so Arya need not serve </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them. She was glad of that; on the very night they arrived, fighting broke out between the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sellswords and some Lannister men. Ser Harys Swyft’s squire was stabbed to death and two </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of the Bloody Mummers were wounded. The next morning Lord Tywin hanged them both </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from the gatehouse walls, along with one of Lord Lydden’s archers. Weese said the archer </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had started all the trouble by taunting the sellswords over Beric Dondarrion. After the hanged </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">men had stopped kicking, Vargo Hoat and Ser Harys embraced and kissed and swore to love </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">each other always as Lord Tywin looked on. Arya thought it was funny the way Vargo Hoat </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">lisped and slobbered, but she knew better than to laugh. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Bloody Mummers did not linger long at Harrenhal, but before they rode out again, </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Arya heard one of them saying how a northern army under Roose Bolton had occupied the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ruby ford of the Trident. “If he crosses, Lord Tywin will smash him again like he did on the </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Green Fork,” a Lannister bowman said, but his fellows jeered him down. “Bolton’ll never </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cross, not till the Young Wolf marches from Riverrun with his wild northmen and all them </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">wolves.” </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya had not known her brother was so near. Riverrun was much closer than Winterfell, </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">though she was not certain where it lay in relation to Harrenhal. <i>I could find out somehow, I </i></text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>know I could, if only I could get away.</i> When she thought of seeing Robb’s face again Arya </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">had to bite her lip. <i>And I want to see Jon too, and Bran and Rickon, and Mother. Even </i></text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="531" height="15" font="5"><i>Sansa . . . I’ll kiss her and beg her pardons like a proper lady, she’ll like that.</i> </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">From the courtyard talk she’d learned that the upper chambers of the Tower of Dread </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">housed three dozen captives taken during some battle on the Green Fork of the Trident. Most </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">had been given freedom of the castle in return for their pledge not to attempt escape. <i>They </i></text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="569" height="15" font="5"><i>vowed not to escape</i>, Arya told herself, <i>but they never swore not to help</i> me <i>escape.</i> </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The captives ate at their own table in the Hall of a Hundred Hearths, and could often be </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">seen about the grounds. Four brothers took their exercise together every day, fighting with </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">staves and wooden shields in the Flowstone Yard. Three of them were Freys of the Crossing, </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the fourth their bastard brother. They were only there a short time, though; one morning two </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">other brothers arrived under a peace banner with a chest of gold, and ransomed them from the </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="415" height="15" font="1">knights who’d captured them. The six Freys all left together. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No one ransomed the northmen, though. One fat lordling haunted the kitchens, Hot Pie </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">told her, always looking for a morsel. His mustache was so bushy that it covered his mouth, </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and the clasp that held his cloak was a silver-and-sapphire trident. He belonged to Lord </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tywin, but the fierce, bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">off him. Sansa would have known who he was, and the fat one too, but Arya had never taken </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">much interest in titles and sigils. Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">this house and that house, she was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">would be done. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She  <i>did</i> remember Lord Cerwyn, though. His lands had been close to Winterfell, so he </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and his son Cley had often visited. Yet as fate would have it, he was the only captive who was </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">never seen; he was abed in a tower cell, recovering from a wound. For days and days Arya </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tried to work out how she might steal past the door guards to see him. If he knew her, he </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">would be honor-bound to help her. A lord would have gold for a certainty, they all did; </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">perhaps he would pay some of Lord Tywin’s own sellswords to take her to Riverrun. Father </text>
<text top="1039" left="139" width="517" height="15" font="1">had always said that most sellswords would betray anyone for enough gold. </text>
</page>
<page number="247" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Then one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">loading a corpse into their wagon. The body was sewn into a cloak of the finest silk, decorated </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with a battle-axe sigil. When Arya asked who it was, one of the guards told her that Lord </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Cerwyn had died. The words felt like a kick in the belly. <i>He could never have helped you </i></text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>anyway</i>, she thought as the sisters drove the wagon through the gate. <i>He couldn’t even help </i></text>
<text top="202" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="5"><i>himself, you stupid mouse.</i> </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">After that it was back to scrubbing and scurrying and listening at doors. Lord Tywin </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would soon march on Riverrun, she heard, or he would drive south to Highgarden, no one </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would ever expect that. No, he must defend King’s Landing, Stannis was the greatest threat. </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He’d sent Gregor Clegane and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton and remove the dagger </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from his back. He’d sent ravens to the Eyrie, he meant to wed the Lady Lysa Arryn and win </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Vale. He’d bought a ton of silver to forge magic swords that would slay the Stark wargs. </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">He was writing Lady Stark to make a peace, the Kingslayer would soon be freed. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Though ravens came and went every day, Lord Tywin himself spent most of his days </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">behind closed doors with his war council. Arya caught glimpses of him, but always from </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">afar—once walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bushy mustache, once riding out with his lords bannermen to visit the encampments, but most </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below. </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">He stood with his hands locked together on the gold pommel of his longsword. They said </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin loved gold most of all; he even <i>shit</i> gold, she heard one squire jest. The Lannister </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lord was strong-looking for an old man, with stiff golden whiskers and a bald head. There was </text>
<text top="524" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">something in his face that reminded Arya of her own father, even though they looked nothing </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">alike.  <i>He has a lord’s face, that’s all</i>, she told herself. She remembered hearing her lady </text>
<text top="563" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mother tell Father to put on his lord’s face and go deal with some matter. Father had laughed </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">at that. She could not imagine Lord Tywin ever laughing at anything. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One afternoon, while she was waiting her turn to draw a pail of water from the well, she </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heard the hinges of the east gate groaning. A party of men rode under the portcullis at a walk. </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">When she spied the manticore crawling across the shield of their leader, a stab of hate shot </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">through her. </text>
<text top="691" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In the light of day, Ser Amory Lorch looked less frightening than he had by torchlight, </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but he still had the pig’s eyes she recalled. One of the women said that his men had ridden all </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the way around the lake chasing Beric Dondarrion and slaying rebels. <i>We weren’t rebels</i>, </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Arya thought. <i>We were the Night’s Watch; the Night’s Watch takes no side.</i> Ser Amory had </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fewer men than she remembered, though, and many wounded. <i>I hope their wounds fester. I </i></text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="5"><i>hope they all die.</i> </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">Then she saw the three near the end of the column. </text>
<text top="839" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Rorge had donned a black half-helm with a broad iron nasal that made it hard to see that </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he did not have a nose. Biter rode ponderously beside him on a destrier that looked ready to </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">collapse under his weight. Half-healed burns covered his body, making him even more </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">hideous than before. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">But Jaqen H’ghar still smiled. His garb was still ragged and filthy, but he had found time </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to wash and brush his hair. It streamed down across his shoulders, red and white and shiny, </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">and Arya heard the girls giggling to each other in admiration. </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>I should have let the fire have them. Gendry said to, I should have listened.</i> If she hadn’t </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thrown them that axe they’d all be dead. For a moment she was afraid, but they rode past her </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">without a flicker of interest. Only Jaqen H’ghar so much as glanced in her direction, and his </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eyes passed right over her. <i>He does not know me</i>, she thought. <i>Arry was a fierce little boy with </i></text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hands were raw and bleeding and her arms so sore they trembled when she lugged the pail </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back to the cellar. Too tired even for food, Arya begged Weese’s pardons and crawled into </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her straw to sleep. “Weese,” she yawned. “Dunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Cersei.” She thought she might add three more names to her prayer, but she was too tired to </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">decide tonight. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Arya was dreaming of wolves running wild through the wood when a strong hand </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">clamped down over her mouth like smooth warm stone, solid and unyielding. She woke at </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">once, squirming and struggling. “A girl says nothing,” a voice whispered close behind her ear. </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">“A girl keeps her lips closed, no one hears, and friends may talk in secret. Yes?” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">Heart pounding, Arya managed the tiniest of nods. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jaqen H’ghar took his hand away. The cellar was black as pitch and she could not see his </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">face, even inches away. She could <i>smell</i> him, though; his skin smelled clean and soapy, and </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">he had scented his hair. “A boy becomes a girl,” he murmured. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="333" height="15" font="1">“I was <i>always</i> a girl. I didn’t think you saw me.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="204" height="15" font="1">“A man sees. A man knows.” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She remembered that she hated him. “You scared me. You’re one of <i>them</i> now, I should </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">have let you burn. What are you doing here? Go away or I’ll yell for Weese.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">“A man pays his debts. A man owes three.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="66" height="15" font="1">“Three?” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">three that were his. This girl must give three in their places. Speak the names, and a man will </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">do the rest.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He wants to help me</i>, Arya realized with a rush of hope that made her dizzy. “Take me to </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">Riverrun, it’s not far, if we stole some horses we could—” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He laid a finger on her lips. “Three lives you shall have of me. No more, no less. Three </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">and we are done. So a girl must ponder.” He kissed her hair softly. “But not too long.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By the time Arya lit her stub of a candle, only a faint smell remained of him, a whiff of </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ginger and cloves lingering in the air. The woman in the next niche rolled over on her straw </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and complained of the light, so Arya blew it out. When she closed her eyes, she saw faces </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">swimming before her. Joffrey and his mother, Ilyn Payne and Meryn Trant and Sandor </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Clegane . . . but they were in King’s Landing hundreds of miles away, and Ser Gregor had </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">lingered only a few nights before departing again for more foraging, taking Raff and </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Chiswyck and the Tickler with him. Ser Amory Lorch was here, though, and she hated him </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">almost as much. Didn’t she? She wasn’t certain. And there was always Weese. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">She thought of him again the next morning, when lack of sleep made her yawn. </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Weasel,” Weese purred, “next time I see that mouth droop open, I’ll pull out your tongue and </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">feed it to my bitch.” He twisted her ear between his fingers to make certain she’d heard, and </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">told her to get back to those steps, he wanted them clean down to the third landing by </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">nightfall. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As she worked, Arya thought about the people she wanted dead. She pretended she could </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">see their faces on the steps, and scrubbed harder to wipe them away. The Starks were at war </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with the Lannisters and she was a Stark, so she should kill as many Lannisters as she could, </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that was what you did in wars. But she didn’t think she should trust Jaqen. <i>I should kill them </i></text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>myself.</i> Whenever her father had condemned a man to death, he did the deed himself with Ice, </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="420" height="15" font="1">hear his last words,” she’d heard him tell Robb and Jon once. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The next day she avoided Jaqen H’ghar, and the day after that. It was not hard. She was </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="561" height="15" font="1">very small and Harrenhal was very large, full of places where a mouse could hide. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And then Ser Gregor returned, earlier than expected, driving a herd of goats this time in </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">place of a herd of prisoners. She heard he’d lost four men in one of Lord Beric’s night raids, </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">but those Arya hated returned unscathed and took up residence on the second floor of the </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Wailing Tower. Weese saw that they were well supplied with drink. “They always have a </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">good thirst, that lot,” he grumbled. “Weasel, go up and ask if they’ve got any clothes that need </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">mending, I’ll have the women see to it.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Arya ran up her well-scrubbed steps. No one paid her any mind when she entered. </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Chiswyck was seated by the fire with a horn of ale to hand, telling one of his funny stories. </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="380" height="15" font="1">She dared not interrupt, unless she wanted a bloody lip. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“After the Hand’s tourney, it were, before the war come,” Chiswyck was saying. “We </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were on our ways back west, seven of us with Ser Gregor. Raff was with me, and young Joss </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Stilwood, he’d squired for Ser in the lists. Well, we come on this pisswater river, running high </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on account there’d been rains. No way to ford, but there’s an alehouse near, so there we </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">repair. Ser rousts the brewer and tells him to keep our horns full till the waters fall, and you </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">should see the man’s pig eyes shine at the sight o’ silver. So he’s fetching us ale, him and his </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">daughter, and poor thin stuff it is, no more’n brown piss, which don’t make me any happier, </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nor Ser neither. And all the time this brewer’s saying how glad he is to have us, custom being </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slow on account o’ them rains. The fool won’t shut his yap, not him, though Ser is saying not </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a word, just brooding on the Knight o’ Pansies and that bugger’s trick he played. You can see </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">how tight his mouth sits, so me and the other lads we know better’n to say a squeak to him, </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but this brewer he’s got to talk, he even asks how m’lord fared in the jousting. Ser just gave </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him this look.” Chiswyck cackled, quaffed his ale, and wiped the foam away with the back of </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his hand. “Meanwhile, this daughter of his has been fetching and pouring, a fat little thing, </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="124" height="15" font="1">eighteen or so—” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="348" height="15" font="1">“Thirteen, more like,” Raff the Sweetling drawled. </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, be that as it may, she’s not much to look at, but Eggon’s been drinking and gets to </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">touching her, and might be I did a little touching meself, and Raff’s telling young Stilwood </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that he ought t’ drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man, giving the lad courage as it </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were. Finally Joss reaches up under her skirt, and she shrieks and drops her flagon and goes </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">running off to the kitchen. Well, it would have ended right there, only what does the old fool </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">do but he goes to <i>Ser</i> and asks him to make us leave the girl alone, him being an anointed </text>

<text top="845" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ser Gregor, he wasn’t paying no mind to none of our fun, but now he <i>looks</i>, you know </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">how he does, and he commands that the girl be brought before him. Now the old man has to </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drag her out of the kitchen, and no one to blame but hisself. Ser looks her over and says, ‘So </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">this is the whore you’re so concerned for’ and this besotted old fool says, ‘My Layna’s no </text>

<text top="961" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of her da, her flopping and wiggling like a rabbit and making these noises. The look on the </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">old man’s face, I laughed so hard ale was coming out me nose. Then this boy hears the noise, </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the son I figure, and comes rushing up from the cellar, so Raff has to stick a dirk in his belly. </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">By then Ser’s done, so he goes back to his drinking and we all have a turn. Tobbot, you know </text>
<text top="1039" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">how he is, he flops her over and goes in the back way. The girl was done fighting by the time </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">old man didn’t fetch a fistful of coppers, beg m’lord’s pardon, and <i>thank him for the custom!</i>” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The men all roared, none louder than Chiswyck himself, who laughed so hard at his own </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">story that snot dribbled from his nose down into his scraggy grey beard. Arya stood in the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shadows of the stairwell and watched him. She crept back down to the cellars without saying </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">a word. When Weese found that she hadn’t asked about the clothes, he yanked down her </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">breeches and caned her until blood ran down her thighs, but Arya closed her eyes and thought </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="416" height="15" font="1">of all the sayings Syrio had taught her, so she scarcely felt it. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Two nights later, he sent her to the Barracks Hall to serve at table. She was carrying a </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flagon of wine and pouring when she glimpsed Jaqen H’ghar at his trencher across the aisle. </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Chewing her lip, Arya glanced around warily to make certain Weese was not in sight. <i>Fear </i></text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="5"><i>cuts deeper than swords</i>, she told herself. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She took a step, and another, and with each she felt less a mouse. She worked her way </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down the bench, filling wine cups. Rorge sat to Jaqen’s right, deep drunk, but he took no note </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of her. Arya leaned close and whispered, “Chiswyck,” right in Jaqen’s ear. The Lorathi gave </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">no sign that he had heard. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When her flagon was empty, Arya hurried down to the cellars to refill it from the cask, </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and quickly returned to her pouring. No one had died of thirst while she was gone, nor even </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">noted her brief absence. </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Nothing happened the next day, nor the day after, but on the third day Arya went to the </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kitchens with Weese to fetch their dinner. “One of the Mountain’s men fell off a wallwalk last </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="411" height="15" font="1">night and broke his fool neck,” she heard Weese tell a cook. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="196" height="15" font="1">“Drunk?” the woman asked. </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No more’n usual. Some are saying it was Harren’s ghost flung him down.” He snorted </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">to show what he thought of such notions. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>It wasn’t Harren</i>, Arya wanted to say, <i>it was me.</i> She had killed Chiswyck with a </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whisper, and she would kill two more before she was through. <i>I’m the ghost in Harrenhal</i>, she </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="389" height="15" font="1">thought. And that night, there was one less name to hate. </text>

<text top="840" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We are the first, my lady,” Hallis Mollen said as they reined up amidst the stumps, alone </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">between the armies. The direwolf banner of House Stark flapped and fluttered atop the lance </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he bore. Catelyn could not see the sea from here, but she could feel how close it was. The </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="397" height="15" font="1">smell of salt was heavy on the wind gusting from the east. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stannis Baratheon’s foragers had cut the trees down for his siege towers and catapults. </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Catelyn wondered how long the grove had stood, and whether Ned had rested here when he </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">led his host south to lift the last siege of Storm’s End. He had won a great victory that day, all </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">the greater for being bloodless. </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods grant that I shall do the same</i>, Catelyn prayed. Her own liegemen thought she was </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mad even to come. “This is no fight of ours, my lady,” Ser Wendel Manderly had said. “I </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We are all at risk,” she told him, perhaps too sharply. “Do you think I wish to be here, </text>

<text top="162" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">between these brothers, Catelyn knew, yet for the good of the realm, it must be tried. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Across rain-sodden fields and stony ridges, she could see the great castle of Storm’s End </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rearing up against the sky, its back to the unseen sea. Beneath that mass of pale grey stone, the </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">encircling army of Lord Stannis Baratheon looked as small and insignificant as mice with </text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The songs said that Storm’s End had been raised in ancient days by Durran, the first </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Storm King, who had won the love of the fair Elenei, daughter of the sea god and the goddess </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the wind. On the night of their wedding, Elenei had yielded her maidenhood to a mortal’s </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">love and thus doomed herself to a mortal’s death, and her grieving parents had unleashed their </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrath and sent the winds and waters to batter down Durran’s hold. His friends and brothers </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and wedding guests were crushed beneath collapsing walls or blown out to sea, but Elenei </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sheltered Durran within her arms so he took no harm, and when the dawn came at last he </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">declared war upon the gods and vowed to rebuild. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Five more castles he built, each larger and stronger than the last, only to see them </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smashed asunder when the gale winds came howling up Shipbreaker Bay, driving great walls </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of water before them. His lords pleaded with him to build inland; his priests told him he must </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">placate the gods by giving Elenei back to the sea; even his smallfolk begged him to relent. </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Durran would have none of it. A seventh castle he raised, most massive of all. Some said the </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">children of the forest helped him build it, shaping the stones with magic; others claimed that a </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">small boy told him what he must do, a boy who would grow to be Bran the Builder. No matter </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">how the tale was told, the end was the same. Though the angry gods threw storm after storm </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">against it, the seventh castle stood defiant, and Durran Godsgrief and fair Elenei dwelt there </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">together until the end of their days. </text>
<text top="633" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Gods do not forget, and still the gales came raging up the narrow sea. Yet Storm’s End </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">endured, through centuries and tens of centuries, a castle like no other. Its great curtain wall </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was a hundred feet high, unbroken by arrow slit or postern, everywhere rounded, curving, </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>smooth</i>, its stones fit so cunningly together that nowhere was crevice nor angle nor gap by </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">which the wind might enter. That wall was said to be forty feet thick at its narrowest, and near </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">eighty on the seaward face, a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Within that mighty bulwark, the kitchens and stables and yards sheltered safe from wind and </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">wave. Of towers, there was but one, a colossal drum tower, windowless where it faced the sea, </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">so large that it was granary and barracks and feast hall and lord’s dwelling all in one, crowned </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="618" height="15" font="1">by massive battlements that made it look from afar like a spiked fist atop an up-thrust arm. </text>
<text top="833" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My lady,” Hal Mollen called. Two riders had emerged from the tidy little camp beneath </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">the castle, and were coming toward them at a slow walk. “That will be King Stannis.” </text>
<text top="878" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“No doubt.” Catelyn watched them come. <i>Stannis it must be, yet that is not the </i></text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>Baratheon banner.</i> It was a bright yellow, not the rich gold of Renly’s standards, and the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="437" height="15" font="1">device it bore was red, though she could not make out its shape. </text>
<text top="942" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Renly would be last to arrive. He had told her as much when she set out. He did not </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">propose to mount his horse until he saw his brother well on his way. The first to arrive must </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wait on the other, and Renly would do no waiting. <i>It is a sort of game kings play</i>, she told </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">herself. Well, she was no king, so she need not play it. Catelyn was practiced at waiting. </text>
<text top="1025" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As he neared, she saw that Stannis wore a crown of red gold with points fashioned in the </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shape of flames. His belt was studded with garnets and yellow topaz, and a great square-cut </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ruby was set in the hilt of the sword he wore. Otherwise his dress was plain: studded leather </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">jerkin over quilted doublet, worn boots, breeches of brown rough-spun. The device on his </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sun-yellow banner showed a red heart surrounded by a blaze of orange fire. The crowned stag </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">was there, yes . . . shrunken and enclosed within the heart. Even more curious was his </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">standard-bearer—a woman, garbed all in reds, face shadowed within the deep hood of her </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">scarlet cloak. <i>A red priestess</i>, Catelyn thought, wondering. The sect was numerous and </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">powerful in the Free Cities and the distant east, but there were few in the Seven Kingdoms. </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lady Stark,” Stannis Baratheon said with chill courtesy as he reined up. He inclined his </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">head, balder than she remembered. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="202" height="15" font="1">“Lord Stannis,” she returned. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Beneath the tight-trimmed beard his heavy jaw clenched hard, yet he did not hector her </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="618" height="15" font="1">about titles. For that she was duly grateful. “I had not thought to find you at Storm’s End.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="211" height="15" font="1">“I had not thought to be here.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">His deep-set eyes regarded her uncomfortably. This was not a man made for easy </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">courtesies. “I am sorry for your lord’s death,” he said, “though Eddard Stark was no friend to </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He was never your enemy, my lord. When the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne held you </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="1">prisoned in that castle, starving, it was Eddard Stark who broke the siege.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“At my brother’s command, not for love of me,” Stannis answered. “Lord Eddard did his </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="538" height="15" font="1">duty, I will not deny it. Did I ever do less? <i>I</i> should have been Robert’s Hand.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="1">“That was your brother’s will. Ned never wanted it.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yet he took it. That which should have been mine. Still, I give you my word, you shall </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">have justice for his murder.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>How they loved to promise heads, these men who would be king.</i> “Your brother promised </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">me the same. But if truth be told, I would sooner have my daughters back, and leave justice to </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the gods. Cersei still holds my Sansa, and of Arya there has been no word since the day of </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">Robert’s death.” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“If your children are found when I take the city, they shall be sent to you.” <i>Alive or dead</i>, </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">his tone implied. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And when shall that be, Lord Stannis? King’s Landing is close to your Dragonstone, but </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="168" height="15" font="1">I find you here instead.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You are frank, Lady Stark. Very well, I’ll answer you frankly. To take the city, I need </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the power of these southron lords I see across the field. My brother has them. I must needs </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">take them from him.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Men give their allegiance where they will, my lord. These lords swore fealty to Robert </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">and House Baratheon. If you and your brother were to put aside your quarrel—” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I have no quarrel with Renly, should he prove dutiful. I am his elder, and his king. I </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">want only what is mine by rights. Renly owes me loyalty and obedience. I mean to have it. </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">From him, and from these other lords.” Stannis studied her face. “And what cause brings you </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">to this field, my lady? Has House Stark cast its lot with my brother, is that the way of it?” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>This one will never bend</i>, she thought, yet she must try nonetheless. Too much was at </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stake. “My son reigns as King in the North, by the will of our lords and people. He bends the </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">knee to no man, but holds out the hand of friendship to all.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="516" height="15" font="1">“Kings have no friends,” Stannis said bluntly, “only subjects and enemies.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“And brothers,” a cheerful voice called out behind her. Catelyn glanced over her shoulder </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">as Lord Renly’s palfrey picked her way through the stumps. The younger Baratheon was </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">splendid in his green velvet doublet and satin cloak trimmed in vair. The crown of golden </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">roses girded his temples, jade stag’s head rising over his forehead, long black hair spilling out </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">beneath. Jagged chunks of black diamond studded his swordbelt, and a chain of gold and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">emeralds looped around his neck. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly had chosen a woman to carry his banner as well, though Brienne hid face and form </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">behind plate armor that gave no hint of her sex. Atop her twelve-foot lance, the crowned stag </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">pranced black-on-gold as the wind off the sea rippled the cloth. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="319" height="15" font="1">His brother’s greeting was curt. “Lord Renly.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“<i>King</i> Renly. Can that truly be you, Stannis?” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">Stannis frowned. “Who else should it be?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Renly gave an easy shrug. “When I saw that standard, I could not be certain. Whose </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">banner do you bear?” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="93" height="15" font="1">“Mine own.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The red-clad priestess spoke up. “The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="108" height="15" font="1">Lord of Light.” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Renly seemed amused by that. “All for the good. If we both use the same banner, the </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">battle will be terribly confused.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn said, “Let us hope there will be no battle. We three share a common foe who </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">would destroy us all.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Stannis studied her, unsmiling. “The Iron Throne is mine by rights. All those who deny </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">that are my foes.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The whole of the realm denies it, brother,” said Renly. “Old men deny it with their death </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rattle, and unborn children deny it in their mothers’ wombs. They deny it in Dorne and they </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">deny it on the Wall. No one wants you for their king. Sorry.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis clenched his jaw, his face taut. “I swore I would never treat with you while you </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="426" height="15" font="1">wore your traitor’s crown. Would that I had kept to that vow.” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This is folly,” Catelyn said sharply. “Lord Tywin sits at Harrenhal with twenty thousand </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swords. The remnants of the Kingslayer’s army have regrouped at the Golden Tooth, another </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lannister host gathers beneath the shadow of Casterly Rock, and Cersei and her son hold </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">King’s Landing and your precious Iron Throne. You each name yourself <i>king</i>, yet the </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="455" height="15" font="1">kingdom bleeds, and no one lifts a sword to defend it but my son.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly shrugged. “Your son has won a few battles. I shall win the war. The Lannisters can </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">wait my pleasure.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“If you have proposals to make, make them,” Stannis said brusquely, “or I will be gone.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Very well,” said Renly. “I propose that you dismount, bend your knee, and swear me </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">your allegiance.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="380" height="15" font="1">Stannis choked back rage. “That you shall never have.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="243" height="15" font="1">“You served Robert, why not me?” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="364" height="15" font="1">“Robert was my elder brother. You are the younger.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="306" height="15" font="1">“Younger, bolder, and <i>far</i> more comely . . .” </text>
<text top="1002" left="171" width="270" height="15" font="1">“. . . and a thief and a usurper besides.” </text>
<text top="1027" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Renly shrugged. “The Targaryens called Robert usurper. He seemed to be able to bear </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">the shame. So shall I.” </text>
</page>
<page number="254" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>This will not do.</i> “Listen to yourselves! If you were sons of mine, I would bang your </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis frowned at her. “You presume too much, Lady Stark. I am the rightful king, and </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="512" height="15" font="1">your son no less a traitor than my brother here. His day will come as well.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The naked threat fanned her fury. “You are very free to name others traitor and usurper, </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">my lord, yet how are you any different? You say you alone are the rightful king, yet it seems </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to me that Robert had two sons. By all the laws of the Seven Kingdoms, Prince Joffrey is his </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="626" height="15" font="1">rightful heir, and Tommen after him . . . and we are <i>all</i> traitors, however good our reasons.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly laughed. “You must forgive Lady Catelyn, Stannis. She’s come all the way down </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">from Riverrun, a long way ahorse. I fear she never saw your little letter.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Joffrey is not my brother’s seed,” Stannis said bluntly. “Nor is Tommen. They are </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="503" height="15" font="1">bastards. The girl as well. All three of them abominations born of incest.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="5"><i>Would even Cersei be so mad?</i> Catelyn was speechless. </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Isn’t that a sweet story, my lady?” Renly asked. “I was camped at Horn Hill when Lord </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tarly received his letter, and I must say, it took my breath away.” He smiled at his brother. “I </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had never suspected you were so clever, Stannis. Were it only true, you would indeed be </text>

<text top="475" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“<i>Were</i> it true? Do you name me a liar?” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“Can you prove any word of this fable?” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="172" height="15" font="1">Stannis ground his teeth. </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Robert could never have known</i>, Catelyn thought, <i>or Cersei would have lost her head in </i></text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>an instant.</i> “Lord Stannis,” she asked, “if you knew the queen to be guilty of such monstrous </text>

<text top="614" left="171" width="554" height="15" font="1">“I did not keep silent,” Stannis declared. “I brought my suspicions to Jon Arryn.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="1">“Rather than your own brother?” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My brother’s regard for me was never more than dutiful,” said Stannis. “From me, such </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">accusations would have seemed peevish and self-serving, a means of placing myself first in </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the line of succession. I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if the charges came </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">from Lord Arryn, whom he loved.” </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="1">“Ah,” said Renly. “So we have the word of a dead man.” </text>
<text top="773" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Do you think he died by happenstance, you purblind fool? Cersei had him poisoned, for </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">fear he would reveal her. Lord Jon had been gathering certain proofs—” </text>
<text top="818" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“—which doubtless died with him. How inconvenient.” </text>
<text top="843" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn was remembering, fitting pieces together. “My sister Lysa accused the queen of </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">killing her husband in a letter she sent me at Winterfell,” she admitted. “Later, in the Eyrie, </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="421" height="15" font="1">she laid the murder at the feet of the queen’s brother Tyrion.” </text>
<text top="907" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Stannis snorted. “If you step in a nest of snakes, does it matter which one bites you </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">first?” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“All this of snakes and incest is droll, but it changes nothing. You may well have the </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">better claim, Stannis, but I still have the larger army.” Renly’s hand slid inside his cloak. </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis saw, and reached at once for the hilt of his sword, but before he could draw steel his </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brother  produced . . . a  peach.  “Would  you  like  one, brother?” Renly asked, smiling. “From </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Highgarden. You’ve never tasted anything so sweet, I promise you.” He took a bite. Juice ran </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="204" height="15" font="1">from the corner of his mouth. </text>
</page>
<page number="255" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">“I did not come here to eat fruit.” Stannis was fuming. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>My lords!</i>” Catelyn said. “We ought to be hammering out the terms of an alliance, not </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">trading taunts.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A man should never refuse to taste a peach,” Renly said as he tossed the stone away. </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“He may never get the chance again. Life is short, Stannis. Remember what the Starks say. </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="454" height="15" font="1">Winter is coming.” He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">“I did not come here to be threatened, either.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Nor were you,” Renly snapped back. “When I make threats, you’ll know it. If truth be </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">told, I’ve never liked you, Stannis, but you <i>are</i> my own blood, and I have no wish to slay you. </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">So if it is Storm’s End you want, take it . . . as a brother’s gift. As Robert once gave it to me, I </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="106" height="15" font="1">give it to you.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">“It is not yours to give. It is mine by rights.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sighing, Renly half turned in the saddle. “What am I to do with this brother of mine, </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="599" height="15" font="1">Brienne? He refuses my peach, he refuses my castle, he even shunned my wedding . . .” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We both know your wedding was a mummer’s farce. A year ago you were scheming to </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">make the girl one of Robert’s whores.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“A year ago I was scheming to make the girl Robert’s queen,” Renly said, “but what does </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">it matter? The boar got Robert and I got Margaery. You’ll be pleased to know she came to me </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">a maid.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="275" height="15" font="1">“In your bed she’s like to die that way.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh, I expect I’ll get a son on her within the year. Pray, how many sons do you have, </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis? Oh, yes—none.” Renly smiled innocently. “As to your daughter, I understand. If my </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="436" height="15" font="1">wife looked like yours, I’d send my fool to service her as well.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“<i>Enough!</i>” Stannis roared. “I will not be mocked to my face, do you hear me? <i>I will not!</i>” </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">He yanked his longsword from its scabbard. The steel gleamed strangely bright in the wan </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sunlight, now red, now yellow, now blazing white. The air around it seemed to shimmer, as if </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">from heat. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Catelyn’s horse whinnied and backed away a step, but Brienne moved between the </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">brothers, her own blade in hand. “Put up your steel!” she shouted at Stannis. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="498" height="15" font="5"><i>Cersei Lannister is laughing herself breathless</i>, Catelyn thought wearily. </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis pointed his shining sword at his brother. “I am not without mercy,” thundered he </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">who was notoriously without mercy. “Nor do I wish to sully Lightbringer with a brother’s </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood. For the sake of the mother who bore us both, I will give you this night to rethink your </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">folly, Renly. Strike your banners and come to me before dawn, and I will grant you Storm’s </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">End and your old seat on the council and even name you my heir until a son is born to me. </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="220" height="15" font="1">Otherwise, I shall destroy you.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Renly laughed. “Stannis, that’s a very pretty sword, I’ll grant you, but I think the glow </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">off it has ruined your eyes. Look across the fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“Do you think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tyrell swords will make me king. Rowan and Tarly and Caron will make me king, with </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">axe and mace and warhammer. Tarth arrows and Penrose lances, Fossoway, Cuy, Mullendore, </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Estermont, Selmy, Hightower, Oakheart, Crane, Caswell, Blackbar, Morrigen, Beesbury, </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Shermer, Dunn, Footly . . . even House Florent, your own wife’s brothers and uncles, they </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will make me king. All the chivalry of the south rides with me, and that is the least part of my </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">power. My foot is coming behind, a hundred thousand swords and spears and pikes. And you </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">will  <i>destroy</i> me? With what, pray? That paltry rabble I see there huddled under the castle </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">walls? I’ll call them five thousand and be generous, codfish lords and onion knights and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sellswords. Half of them are like to come over to me before the battle starts. You have fewer </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than four hundred horse, my scouts tell me—freeriders in boiled leather who will not stand an </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">instant against armored lances. I do not care how seasoned a warrior you think you are, </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">Stannis, that host of yours won’t survive the first charge of my vanguard.” </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We shall see, brother.” Some of the light seemed to go out of the world when Stannis </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">slid his sword back into its scabbard. “Come the dawn, we shall see.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="335" height="15" font="1">“I hope your new god’s a merciful one, brother.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Stannis snorted and galloped away, disdainful. The red priestess lingered a moment </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">behind. “Look to your own sins, Lord Renly,” she said as she wheeled her horse around. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn and Lord Renly returned together to the camp where his thousands and her few </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">waited their return. “That was amusing, if not terribly profitable,” he commented. “I wonder </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">where I can get a sword like that? Well, doubtless Loras will make me a gift of it after the </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="318" height="15" font="1">battle. It grieves me that it must come to this.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="583" height="15" font="1">“You have a cheerful way of grieving,” said Catelyn, whose distress was not feigned. </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Do I?” Renly shrugged. “So be it. Stannis was never the most cherished of brothers, I </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="574" height="15" font="1">confess. Do you suppose this tale of his is true? If Joffrey is the Kingslayer’s get—” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="243" height="15" font="1">“—your brother is the lawful heir.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“While he lives,” Renly admitted. “Though it’s a fool’s law, wouldn’t you agree? Why </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the oldest son, and not the best-fitted? The crown will suit me, as it never suited Robert and </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would not suit Stannis. I have it in me to be a great king, strong yet generous, clever, just, </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="643" height="15" font="1">diligent, loyal to my friends and terrible to my enemies, yet capable of forgiveness, patient—” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="217" height="15" font="1">“—humble?” Catelyn supplied. </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="428" height="15" font="1">Renly laughed. “You must allow a king <i>some</i> flaws, my lady.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn felt very tired. It had all been for nothing. The Baratheon brothers would drown </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">each other in blood while her son faced the Lannisters alone, and nothing she could say or do </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would stop it. <i>It is past time I went back to Riverrun to close my father’s eyes</i>, she thought. </text>
<text top="712" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="5"><i>That much at least I can do. I may be a poor envoy, but I am a good mourner, gods save me.</i> </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Their camp was well sited atop a low stony ridge that ran from north to south. It was far </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">more orderly than the sprawling encampment on the Mander, though only a quarter as large. </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">When he’d learned of his brother’s assault on Storm’s End, Renly had split his forces, much </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as Robb had done at the Twins. His great mass of foot he had left behind at Bitterbridge with </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his young queen, his wagons, carts, draft animals, and all his cumbersome siege machinery, </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">while Renly himself led his knights and freeriders in a swift dash east. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">How like his brother Robert he was, even in that . . . only Robert had always had Eddard </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stark to temper his boldness with caution. Ned would surely have prevailed upon Robert to </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bring up his <i>whole</i> force, to encircle Stannis and besiege the besiegers. That choice Renly had </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">denied himself in his headlong rush to come to grips with his brother. He had outdistanced his </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">supply lines, left food and forage days behind with all his wagons and mules and oxen. He </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="5"><i>must</i> come to battle soon, or starve. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn sent Hal Mollen to tend to their horses while she accompanied Renly back to the </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">royal pavilion at the heart of the encampment. Inside the walls of green silk, his captains and </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lords bannermen were waiting to hear word of the parley. “My brother has not changed,” their </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">young king told them as Brienne unfastened his cloak and lifted the gold-and-jade crown from </text>

<page number="257" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his brow. “Castles and courtesies will not appease him, he must have blood. Well, I am of a </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="168" height="15" font="1">mind to grant his wish.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace, I see no need for battle here,” Lord Mathis Rowan put in. “The castle is </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">strongly garrisoned and well provisioned, Ser Cortnay Penrose is a seasoned commander, and </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the trebuchet has not been built that could breach the walls of Storm’s End. Let Lord Stannis </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have his siege. He will find no joy in it, and whilst he sits cold and hungry and profitless, we </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">will take King’s Landing.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="313" height="15" font="1">“And have men say I feared to face Stannis?” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“Only fools will say that,” Lord Mathis argued. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="328" height="15" font="1">Renly looked to the others. “What say you all?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“I say that Stannis is a danger to you,” Lord Randyll Tarly declared. “Leave him </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">unblooded and he will only grow stronger, while your own power is diminished by battle. The </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lannisters will not be beaten in a day. By the time you are done with them, Lord Stannis may </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">be as strong as you . . . or stronger.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="561" height="15" font="1">Others chorused their agreement. The king looked pleased. “We shall fight, then.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I have failed Robb as I failed Ned</i>, Catelyn thought. “My lord,” she announced. “If you </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">are set on battle, my purpose here is done. I ask your leave to return to Riverrun.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="412" height="15" font="1">“You do not have it.” Renly seated himself on a camp chair. </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She stiffened. “I had hoped to help you make a peace, my lord. I will not help you make </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">a war.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly gave a shrug. “I daresay we’ll prevail without your five-and-twenty, my lady. I do </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="411" height="15" font="1">not mean for you to take part in the battle, only to watch it.” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I was at the Whispering Wood, my lord. I have seen enough butchery. I came here an </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">envoy—” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And an envoy you shall leave,” Renly said, “but wiser than you came. You shall see </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">what befalls rebels with your own eyes, so your son can hear it from your own lips. We’ll </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">keep you safe, never fear.” He turned away to make his dispositions. “Lord Mathis, you shall </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">lead the center of my main battle. Bryce, you’ll have the left. The right is mine. Lord </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="1">Estermont, you shall command the reserve.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="402" height="15" font="1">“I shall not fail you, Your Grace,” Lord Estermont replied. </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">Lord Mathis Rowan spoke up. “Who shall have the van?” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace,” said Ser Jon Fossoway, “I beg the honor.” </text>
<text top="818" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Beg all you like,” said Ser Guyard the Green, “by rights it should be one of the seven </text>
<text top="837" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">who strikes the first blow.” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It takes more than a pretty cloak to charge a shield wall,” Randyll Tarly announced. “I </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="628" height="15" font="1">was leading Mace Tyrell’s van when you were still sucking on your mother’s teat, Guyard.” </text>
<text top="907" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A clamor filled the pavilion, as other men loudly set forth their claims. <i>The knights of </i></text>

<text top="946" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of you should have one, but the greatest glory by rights belongs to the greatest knight. Ser </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“With a glad heart, Your Grace.” The Knight of Flowers knelt before the king. “Grant me </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">helm. The crowded tent was hot, and sweat plastered limp yellow hair to her broad, homely </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“One of seven,” the king reminded her. “Never fear, four of your fellows will be with me </text>

<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Brienne dropped to her knees. “If I must part from Your Grace, grant me the honor of </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Catelyn heard someone snigger behind her. <i>She loves him, poor thing</i>, she thought sadly.<i> </i></text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="592" height="15" font="5"><i>She’d play his squire just to touch him, and never care how great a fool they think her.</i> </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="604" height="15" font="1">“Granted,” Renly said. “Now leave me, all of you. Even kings must rest before a battle.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My lord,” Catelyn said, “there was a small sept in the last village we passed. If you will </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="1">not permit me to depart for Riverrun, grant me leave to go there and pray.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“As you will. Ser Robar, give Lady Stark safe escort to this sept . . . but see that she </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">returns to us by dawn.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">“You might do well to pray yourself,” Catelyn added. </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="103" height="15" font="1">“For victory?” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="105" height="15" font="1">“For wisdom.” </text>
<text top="492" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly laughed. “Loras, stay and help me pray. It’s been so long I’ve quite forgotten how. </text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">As to the rest of you, I want every man in place by first light, armed, armored, and horsed. We </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="346" height="15" font="1">shall give Stannis a dawn he will not soon forget.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dusk was falling when Catelyn left the pavilion. Ser Robar Royce fell in beside her. She </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knew him slightly—one of Bronze Yohn’s sons, comely in a rough-hewn way, a tourney </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">warrior of some renown. Renly had gifted him with a rainbow cloak and a suit of blood-red </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">armor, and named him one of his seven. “You are a long way from the Vale, ser,” she told </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="35" height="15" font="1">him. </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="280" height="15" font="1">“And you far from Winterfell, my lady.” </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I know what brought me here, but why have you come? This is not your battle, no more </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="1">than it is mine.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="348" height="15" font="1">“I made it my battle when I made Renly my king.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“The Royces are bannermen to House Arryn.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My lord father owes Lady Lysa fealty, as does his heir. A second son must find glory </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">where he can.” Ser Robar shrugged. “A man grows weary of tourneys.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">He could not be older than one-and-twenty, Catelyn thought, of an age with his </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">king . . . but <i>her</i> king, her Robb, had more wisdom at fifteen than this youth had ever learned. </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">Or so she prayed. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">In Catelyn’s small corner of the camp, Shadd was slicing carrots into a kettle, Hal Mollen </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was dicing with three of his Winterfell men, and Lucas Blackwood sat sharpening his dagger. </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="568" height="15" font="1">“Lady Stark,” Lucas said when he saw her, “Mollen says it is to be battle at dawn.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="559" height="15" font="1">“Hal has the truth of it,” she answered. <i>And a loose tongue as well, it would seem.</i> </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="156" height="15" font="1">“Do we fight or flee?” </text>
<text top="1002" left="171" width="341" height="15" font="1">“We pray, Lucas,” she answered him. “We pray.” </text>

<text top="174" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Sansa tried to hurry, but her fingers fumbled at buttons and knots. The Hound was </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">always rough-tongued, but something in the way he had looked at her filled her with dread. </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Had Joffrey found out about her meetings with Ser Dontos? <i>Please no</i>, she thought as she </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brushed out her hair. Ser Dontos was her only hope. <i>I have to look pretty, Joff likes me to look </i></text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>pretty, he’s always liked me in this gown, this color.</i> She smoothed the cloth down. The fabric </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">was tight across her chest. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she emerged, Sansa walked on the Hound’s left, away from the burned side of his </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="218" height="15" font="1">face. “Tell me what I’ve done.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="222" height="15" font="1">“Not you. Your kingly brother.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Robb’s a traitor.” Sansa knew the words by rote. “I had no part in whatever he did.” </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods be good, don’t let it be the Kingslayer.</i> If Robb had harmed Jaime Lannister, it would </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mean her life. She thought of Ser Ilyn, and how those terrible pale eyes stared pitilessly out of </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="196" height="15" font="1">that gaunt pockmarked face. </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Hound snorted. “They trained you well, little bird.” He conducted her to the lower </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bailey, where a crowd had gathered around the archery butts. Men moved aside to let them </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through. She could hear Lord Gyles coughing. Loitering stablehands eyed her insolently, but </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ser Horas Redwyne averted his gaze as she passed, and his brother Hobber pretended not to </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">see her. A yellow cat was dying on the ground, mewling piteously, a crossbow quarrel </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="354" height="15" font="1">through its ribs. Sansa stepped around it, feeling ill. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Dontos approached on his broomstick horse; since he’d been too drunk to mount his </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">destrier at the tourney, the king had decreed that henceforth he must always go horsed. “Be </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">brave,” he whispered, squeezing her arm. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Joffrey stood in the center of the throng, winding an ornate crossbow. Ser Boros and Ser </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="543" height="15" font="1">Meryn were with him. The sight of them was enough to tie her insides in knots. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="250" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace.” She fell to her knees. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Kneeling won’t save you now,” the king said. “Stand up. You’re here to answer for your </text>

<text top="750" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace, whatever my traitor brother has done, I had no part. You know that, I beg </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">you, please—” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="97" height="15" font="1">“<i>Get her up!</i>” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="324" height="15" font="1">The Hound pulled her to her feet, not ungently. </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="336" height="15" font="1">“Ser Lancel,” Joff said, “tell her of this outrage.” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Sansa had always thought Lancel Lannister comely and well spoken, but there was </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">neither pity nor kindness in the look he gave her. “Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">upon Ser Stafford Lannister with an army of wargs, not three days’ ride from Lannisport. </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Thousands of good men were butchered as they slept, without the chance to lift sword. After </text>

<text top="973" left="171" width="328" height="15" font="1">Horror coiled cold hands around Sansa’s throat. </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="292" height="15" font="1">“You have nothing to say?” asked Joffrey. </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="491" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace, the poor child is shocked witless,” murmured Ser Dontos. </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Silence, fool.” Joffrey lifted his crossbow and pointed it at her face. “You Starks are as </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="590" height="15" font="1">unnatural as those wolves of yours. I’ve not forgotten how your monster savaged me.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">“That was Arya’s wolf,” she said. “Lady never hurt you, but you killed her anyway.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No, your father did,” Joff said, “but I killed your father. I wish I’d done it myself. I </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">killed a man last night who was bigger than your father. They came to the gate shouting my </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">name and calling for bread like I was some <i>baker</i>, but I taught them better. I shot the loudest </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="202" height="15" font="1">one right through the throat.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And he died?” With the ugly iron head of the quarrel staring her in the face, it was hard </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="173" height="15" font="1">to think what else to say. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Of course he died, he had my quarrel in his throat. There was a woman throwing rocks, </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">I got her as well, but only in the arm.” Frowning, he lowered the crossbow. “I’d shoot you </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">too, but if I do Mother says they’d kill my uncle Jaime. Instead you’ll just be punished and </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">we’ll send word to your brother about what will happen to you if he doesn’t yield. Dog, hit </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">her.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let me beat her!” Ser Dontos shoved forward, tin armor clattering. He was armed with a </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“morningstar” whose head was a melon. <i>My Florian.</i> She could have kissed him, blotchy skin </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and broken veins and all. He trotted his broomstick around her, shouting “Traitor, traitor” and </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whacking her over the head with the melon. Sansa covered herself with her hands, staggering </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">every time the fruit pounded her, her hair sticky by the second blow. People were laughing. </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The melon flew to pieces. <i>Laugh, Joffrey</i>, she prayed as the juice ran down her face and the </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="352" height="15" font="1">front of her blue silk gown. <i>Laugh and be satisfied.</i> </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">Joffrey did not so much as snigger. “Boros. Meryn.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Meryn Trant seized Dontos by the arm and flung him brusquely away. The red-faced </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">fool went sprawling, broomstick, melon, and all. Ser Boros seized Sansa. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“Leave her face,” Joffrey commanded. “I like her pretty.” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Boros slammed a fist into Sansa’s belly, driving the air out of her. When she doubled </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">over, the knight grabbed her hair and drew his sword, and for one hideous instant she was </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">certain he meant to open her throat. As he laid the flat of the blade across her thighs, she </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought her legs might break from the force of the blow. Sansa screamed. Tears welled in her </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">eyes. <i>It will be over soon.</i> She soon lost count of the blows. </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="257" height="15" font="1">“Enough,” she heard the Hound rasp. </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“No it isn’t,” the king replied. “Boros, make her naked.” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Boros shoved a meaty hand down the front of Sansa’s bodice and gave a hard yank. The </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silk came tearing away, baring her to the waist. Sansa covered her breasts with her hands. She </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">could hear sniggers, far off and cruel. “Beat her bloody,” Joffrey said, “we’ll see how her </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="130" height="15" font="1">brother fancies—” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="213" height="15" font="1">“<i>What is the meaning of this?</i>” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Imp’s voice cracked like a whip, and suddenly Sansa was free. She stumbled to her </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knees, arms crossed over her chest, her breath ragged. “Is this your notion of chivalry, Ser </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Boros?” Tyrion Lannister demanded angrily. His pet sellsword stood with him, and one of his </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="569" height="15" font="1">wildlings, the one with the burned eye. “What sort of knight beats helpless maids?” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The sort who serves his king, Imp.” Ser Boros raised his sword, and Ser Meryn stepped </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">up beside him, his blade scraping clear of its scabbard. </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Careful with those,” warned the dwarf’s sellsword. “You don’t want to get blood all </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">over those pretty white cloaks.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Someone give the girl something to cover herself with,” the Imp said. Sandor Clegane </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">unfastened his cloak and tossed it at her. Sansa clutched it against her chest, fists bunched </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="609" height="15" font="1">“This girl’s to be your queen,” the Imp told Joffrey. “Have you no regard for her honor?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="145" height="15" font="1">“I’m punishing her.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="385" height="15" font="1">“For what crime? She did not fight her brother’s battle.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="209" height="15" font="1">“She has the blood of a wolf.” </text>

<text top="389" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion Lannister raised an eyebrow. “I am not threatening the king, ser, I am educating </text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">my nephew. Bronn, Timett, the next time Ser Boros opens his mouth, kill him.” The dwarf </text>
<text top="428" left="139" width="388" height="15" font="1">smiled. “Now <i>that</i> was a threat, ser. See the difference?” </text>
<text top="453" left="171" width="463" height="15" font="1">Ser Boros turned a dark shade of red. “The queen will hear of this!” </text>
<text top="478" left="171" width="523" height="15" font="1">“No doubt she will. And why wait? Joffrey, shall we send for your mother?” </text>
<text top="503" left="171" width="123" height="15" font="1">The king flushed. </text>

<text top="592" left="171" width="552" height="15" font="1">“Fear is better than love, Mother says.” Joffrey pointed at Sansa. “<i>She</i> fears me.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The Imp sighed. “Yes, I see. A pity Stannis and Renly aren’t twelve-year-old girls as </text>

<text top="662" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa moved as if in a dream. She thought the Imp’s men would take her back to her </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bedchamber in Maegor’s Holdfast, but instead they conducted her to the Tower of the Hand. </text>
<text top="701" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She had not set foot inside that place since the day her father fell from grace, and it made her </text>

<text top="745" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Some serving girls took charge of her, mouthing meaningless comforts to stop her </text>
<text top="765" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shaking. One stripped off the ruins of her gown and smallclothes, and another bathed her and </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">washed the sticky juice from her face and her hair. As they scrubbed her down with soap and </text>
<text top="804" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">sluiced warm water over her head, all she could see were the faces from the bailey. <i>Knights </i></text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>are sworn to defend the weak, protect women, and fight for the right, but none of them did a </i></text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>thing.</i> Only Ser Dontos had tried to help, and he was no longer a knight, no more than the Imp </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was, nor the Hound . . . the Hound hated knights . . . <i>I hate them too</i>, Sansa thought. <i>They are </i></text>

<text top="907" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After she was clean, plump ginger-headed Maester Frenken came to see her. He bid her </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lie facedown on the mattress while he spread a salve across the angry red welts that covered </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the backs of her legs. Afterward he mixed her a draught of dreamwine, with some honey so it </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">might go down easier. “Sleep a bit, child. When you wake, all this will seem a bad dream.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>No it won’t, you stupid man</i>, Sansa thought, but she drank the dreamwine anyway, and </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">slept. </text>
<text top="1035" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was dark when she woke again, not quite knowing where she was, the room both </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">slipped it on and opened the door. Outside stood a hard-faced woman with leathery brown </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">skin, three necklaces looped about her scrawny neck. One was gold and one was silver and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one was made of human ears. “Where does she think she’s going?” the woman asked, leaning </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">on a tall spear. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The godswood.” She had to find Ser Dontos, beg him to take her home <i>now</i> before it </text>

<text top="252" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">“The halfman said you’re not to leave,” the woman said. “Pray here, the gods will hear.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Meekly, Sansa dropped her eyes and retreated back inside. She realized suddenly why </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">this place seemed so familiar. <i>They’ve put me in Arya’s old bedchamber, from when Father </i></text>

<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A short time later, a serving girl brought a platter of cheese and bread and olives, with a </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flagon of cold water. “Take it away,” Sansa commanded, but the girl left the food on a table. </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She <i>was</i> thirsty, she realized. Every step sent knives through her thighs, but she made herself </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cross the room. She drank two cups of water, and was nibbling on an olive when the knock </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">came. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">Anxiously, she turned toward the door, smoothed down the folds of her robe. “Yes?” </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The door opened, and Tyrion Lannister stepped inside. “My lady. I trust I am not </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">disturbing you?” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="157" height="15" font="1">“Am I your prisoner?” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My guest.” He was wearing his chain of office, a necklace of linked golden hands. “I </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">thought we might talk.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As my lord commands.” Sansa found it hard not to stare; his face was so ugly it held a </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">queer fascination for her. </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The food and garments are to your satisfaction?” he asked. “If there is anything else you </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">need, you have only to ask.” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="543" height="15" font="1">“You are most kind. And this morning . . . it was very good of you to help me.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You have a right to know why Joffrey was so wroth. Six nights gone, your brother fell </text>

<text top="801" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Robb will kill you all</i>, she thought, exulting. “It’s . . . terrible, my lord. My brother is a </text>

<text top="845" left="171" width="524" height="15" font="1">The dwarf smiled wanly. “Well, he’s no fawn, he’s made that clear enough.” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“Ser Lancel said Robb led an army of wargs . . .” </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The Imp gave a disdainful bark of laughter. “Ser Lancel’s a wineskin warrior who </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wouldn’t know a warg from a wart. Your brother had his direwolf with him, but I suspect </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that’s as far as it went. The northmen crept into my uncle’s camp and cut his horse lines, and </text>

<text top="993" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">weapons to run the faster. Ser Stafford was slain as he chased after a horse. Lord Rickard </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Karstark drove a lance through his chest. Ser Rubert Brax is also dead, along with Ser </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="231" height="15" font="1">“Then . . . there was no sorcery?” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lannister snorted. “Sorcery is the sauce fools spoon over failure to hide the flavor of </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their own incompetence. My mutton-headed uncle had not even troubled to post sentries, it </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">would seem. His host was raw—apprentice boys, miners, field hands, fisherfolk, the </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sweepings of Lannisport. The only mystery is how your brother reached him. Our forces still </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hold the stronghold at the Golden Tooth, and they swear he did not pass.” The dwarf gave an </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">irritated shrug. “Well, Robb Stark is my father’s bane. Joffrey is mine. Tell me, what do you </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">feel for my kingly nephew?” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“I love him with all my heart,” Sansa said at once. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">“Truly?” He did not sound convinced. “Even now?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“My love for His Grace is greater than it has ever been.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Imp laughed aloud. “Well, someone has taught you to lie well. You may be grateful </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">for that one day, child. You <i>are</i> a child still, are you not? Or have you flowered?” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sansa blushed. It was a rude question, but the shame of being stripped before half the </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="332" height="15" font="1">castle made it seem like nothing. “No, my lord.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“That’s all to the good. If it gives you any solace, I do not intend that you ever wed </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Joffrey. No marriage will reconcile Stark and Lannister after all that has happened, I fear. </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">More’s the pity. The match was one of King Robert’s better notions, if Joffrey hadn’t mucked </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">it up.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="500" height="15" font="1">She knew she ought to say something, but the words caught in her throat. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You grow very quiet,” Tyrion Lannister observed. “Is this what you want? An end to </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">your betrothal?” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I . . .” Sansa did not know what to say. <i>Is it a trick? Will he punish me if I tell the truth?</i> </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She stared at the dwarf’s brutal bulging brow, the hard black eye and the shrewd green one, </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="1">the crooked teeth and wiry beard. “I only want to be loyal.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Loyal,” the dwarf mused, “and far from any Lannisters. I can scarce blame you for that. </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">When I was your age, I wanted the same thing.” He smiled. “They tell me you visit the </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="362" height="15" font="1">godswood every day. What do you pray for, Sansa?” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I pray for Robb’s victory and Joffrey’s death . . . and for home. For Winterfell.</i> “I pray </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">for an end to the fighting.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We’ll have that soon enough. There will be another battle, between your brother Robb </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="338" height="15" font="1">and my lord father, and that will settle the issue.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>Robb will beat him</i>, Sansa thought. <i>He beat your uncle and your brother Jaime, he’ll beat </i></text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="110" height="15" font="5"><i>your father too.</i> </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was as if her face were an open book, so easily did the dwarf read her hopes. “Do not </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">take Oxcross too much to heart, my lady,” he told her, not unkindly. “A battle is not a war, </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and my lord father is assuredly not my uncle Stafford. The next time you visit the godswood, </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pray that your brother has the wisdom to bend the knee. Once the north returns to the king’s </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">peace, I mean to send you home.” He hopped down off the window seat and said, “You may </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">sleep here tonight. I’ll give you some of my own men as a guard, some Stone Crows </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">perhaps—” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No,” Sansa blurted out, aghast. If she was locked in the Tower of the Hand, guarded by </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="502" height="15" font="1">the dwarf’s men, how would Ser Dontos ever spirit her away to freedom? </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Would you prefer Black Ears? I’ll give you Chella if a woman would make you more at </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="333" height="15" font="1">“Please, no, my lord, the wildlings frighten me.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He grinned. “Me as well. But more to the point, they frighten Joffrey and that nest of sly </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">vipers and lickspittle dogs he calls a Kingsguard. With Chella or Timett by your side, no one </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I would sooner return to my own bed.” A lie came to her suddenly, but it seemed so </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>right</i> that she blurted it out at once. “This tower was where my father’s men were slain. Their </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion Lannister studied her face. “I am no stranger to nightmares, Sansa. Perhaps you </text>

<text top="377" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was full dark before they found the village. Catelyn found herself wondering if the </text>

<text top="416" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with all they owned, down to the candles in the sept. Ser Wendel lit a torch and led her </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">through the low door. </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Within, the seven walls were cracked and crooked. <i>God is one</i>, Septon Osmynd had </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">taught her when she was a girl, <i>with seven aspects, as the sept is a single building, with seven </i></text>

<text top="539" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">charcoal drawings. Ser Wendel set the torch in a sconce near the door, and left to wait outside </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">with Robar Royce. </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn studied the faces. The Father was bearded, as ever. The Mother smiled, loving </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">and protective. The Warrior had his sword sketched in beneath his face, the Smith his </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">hammer. The Maid was beautiful, the Crone wizened and wise. </text>

<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Here the face was a black oval, a shadow with stars for eyes. It made Catelyn uneasy. She </text>

<text top="731" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She knelt before the Mother. “My lady, look down on this battle with a mother’s eyes. </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">They are all sons, every one. Spare them if you can, and spare my own sons as well. Watch </text>

<text top="795" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A crack ran down through the Mother’s left eye. It made her look as if she were crying. </text>

<text top="1040" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The smoke was making her eyes burn. She rubbed at them with the heels of her scarred </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Catelyn thought, remembering her mother’s soft hands, her warm smile. <i>If she had lived, how </i></text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>different our lives might have been.</i> She wondered what Lady Minisa would make of her </text>

<text top="265" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her head swam, and the sept seemed to move around her. The shadows swayed and </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shifted, furtive animals racing across the cracked white walls. Catelyn had not eaten today. </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Perhaps that had been unwise. She told herself that there had been no time, but the truth was </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that food had lost its savor in a world without Ned. <i>When they took his head off, they killed me </i></text>

<text top="369" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Behind her the torch spit, and suddenly it seemed to her that it was her sister’s face on the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wall, though the eyes were harder than she recalled, not Lysa’s eyes but Cersei’s. <i>Cersei is a </i></text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>mother too. No matter who fathered those children, she felt them kick inside her, brought </i></text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="620" height="15" font="5"><i>them forth with her pain and blood, nursed them at her breast. If they are truly Jaime’s . . .</i> </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Does Cersei pray to you too, my lady?” Catelyn asked the Mother. She could see the </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">proud, cold, lovely features of the Lannister queen etched upon the wall. The crack was still </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">there; even Cersei could weep for her children. “Each of the Seven embodies all of the </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Seven,” Septon Osmynd had told her once. There was as much beauty in the Crone as in the </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Maiden, and the Mother could be fiercer than the Warrior when her children were in danger. </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="5"><i>Yes . . .</i> </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She had seen enough of Robert Baratheon at Winterfell to know that the king did not </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">regard Joffrey with any great warmth. If the boy was truly Jaime’s seed, Robert would have </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">put him to death along with his mother, and few would have condemned him. Bastards were </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">common enough, but incest was a monstrous sin to both old gods and new, and the children of </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">such wickedness were named abominations in sept and godswood alike. The dragon kings had </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wed brother to sister, but they were the blood of old Valyria where such practices had been </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">common, and like their dragons the Targaryens answered to neither gods nor men. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ned must have known, and Lord Arryn before him. Small wonder that the queen had </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">killed them both. <i>Would I do any less for my own?</i> Catelyn clenched her hands, feeling the </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tightness in her scarred fingers where the assassin’s steel had cut to the bone as she fought to </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">save her son. “Bran knows too,” she whispered, lowering her head. <i>Gods be good, he must </i></text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="5"><i>have seen something, heard something, that was why they tried to kill him in his bed.</i> </text>
<text top="819" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lost and weary, Catelyn Stark gave herself over to her gods. She knelt before the Smith, </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">who fixed things that were broken, and asked that he give her sweet Bran his protection. She </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">went to the Maid and beseeched her to lend her courage to Arya and Sansa, to guard them in </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">their innocence. To the Father, she prayed for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">know it, and she asked the Warrior to keep Robb strong and shield him in his battles. Lastly </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she turned to the Crone, whose statues often showed her with a lamp in one hand. “Guide me, </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wise lady,” she prayed. “Show me the path I must walk, and do not let me stumble in the dark </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">places that lie ahead.” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Finally there were footsteps behind her, and a noise at the door. “My lady,” Ser Robar </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="612" height="15" font="1">said gently, “pardon, but our time is at an end. We must be back before the dawn breaks.” </text>
<text top="1025" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn rose stiffly. Her knees ached, and she would have given much for a featherbed </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">and a pillow just then. “Thank you, ser. I am ready.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They rode in silence through sparse woodland where the trees leaned drunkenly away </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">from the sea. The nervous whinny of horses and the clank of steel guided them back to </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Renly’s camp. The long ranks of man and horse were armored in darkness, as black as if the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Smith had hammered night itself into steel. There were banners to her right, banners to her </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">left, and rank on rank of banners before her, but in the predawn gloom, neither colors nor </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sigils could be discerned. <i>A grey army</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>Grey men on grey horses beneath </i></text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>grey banners.</i> As they sat their horses waiting, Renly’s shadow knights pointed their lances </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">upward, so she rode through a forest of tall naked trees, bereft of leaves and life. Where </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End stood was only a deeper darkness, a wall of black through which no stars could </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shine, but she could see torches moving across the fields where Lord Stannis had made his </text>
<text top="299" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">camp. </text>
<text top="324" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The candles within Renly’s pavilion made the shimmering silken walls seem to glow, </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">transforming the great tent into a magical castle alive with emerald light. Two of the Rainbow </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Guard stood sentry at the door to the royal pavilion. The green light shone strangely against </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the purple plums of Ser Parmen’s surcoat, and gave a sickly hue to the sunflowers that </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">covered every inch of Ser Emmon’s enameled yellow plate. Long silken plumes flew from </text>
<text top="421" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">their helms, and rainbow cloaks draped their shoulders. </text>
<text top="446" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Within, Catelyn found Brienne armoring the king for battle while the Lords Tarly and </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Rowan spoke of dispositions and tactics. It was pleasantly warm inside, the heat shimmering </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">off the coals in a dozen small iron braziers. “I must speak with you, Your Grace,” she said, </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">granting him a king’s style for once, anything to make him heed her. </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“In a moment, Lady Catelyn,” Renly replied. Brienne fit backplate to breastplate over his </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">quilted tunic. The king’s armor was a deep green, the green of leaves in a summer wood, so </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dark it drank the candlelight. Gold highlights gleamed from inlay and fastenings like distant </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">fires in that wood, winking every time he moved. “Pray continue, Lord Mathis.” </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace,” Mathis Rowan said with a sideways glance at Catelyn. “As I was saying, </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">our battles are well drawn up. Why wait for daybreak? Sound the advance.” </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And have it said that I won by treachery, with an unchivalrous attack? Dawn was the </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">chosen hour.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Chosen by Stannis,” Randyll Tarly pointed out. “He’d have us charge into the teeth of </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">the rising sun. We’ll be half-blind.” </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Only until first shock,” Renly said confidently. “Ser Loras will break them, and after </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that it will be chaos.” Brienne tightened green leather straps and buckled golden buckles. </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“When my brother falls, see that no insult is done to his corpse. He is my own blood, I will </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="307" height="15" font="1">not have his head paraded about on a spear.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="261" height="15" font="1">“And if he yields?” Lord Tarly asked. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yields?” Lord Rowan laughed. “When Mace Tyrell laid siege to Storm’s End, Stannis </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">ate rats rather than open his gates.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Well I remember.” Renly lifted his chin to allow Brienne to fasten his gorget in place. </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Near the end, Ser Gawen Wylde and three of his knights tried to steal out a postern gate to </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">surrender. Stannis caught them and ordered them flung from the walls with catapults. I can </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">still see Gawen’s face as they strapped him down. He had been our master-at-arms.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lord Rowan appeared puzzled. “No men were hurled from the walls. I would surely </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="114" height="15" font="1">remember that.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Maester Cressen told Stannis that we might be forced to eat our dead, and there was no </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gain in flinging away good meat.” Renly pushed back his hair. Brienne bound it with a velvet </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tie and pulled a padded cap down over his ears, to cushion the weight of his helm. “Thanks to </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Onion Knight we were never reduced to dining on corpses, but it was a close thing. Too </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="295" height="15" font="1">close for Ser Gawen, who died in his cell.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace.” Catelyn had waited patiently, but time grew short. “You promised me a </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">word.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Renly nodded. “See to your battles, my lords . . . oh, and if Barristan Selmy is at my </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">brother’s side, I want him spared.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“There’s been no word of Ser Barristan since Joffrey cast him out,” Lord Rowan </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">objected. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I know that old man. He needs a king to guard, or who is he? Yet he never came to me, </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">and Lady Catelyn says he is not with Robb Stark at Riverrun. Where else but with Stannis?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“As you say, Your Grace. No harm will come to him.” The lords bowed deeply and </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">departed. </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“Say your say, Lady Stark,” Renly said. Brienne swept his cloak over his broad </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">shoulders. It was cloth-of-gold, heavy, with the crowned stag of Baratheon picked out in </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">flakes of jet. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The Lannisters tried to kill my son Bran. A thousand times I have asked myself why. </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Your brother gave me my answer. There was a hunt the day he fell. Robert and Ned and most </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the other men rode out after boar, but Jaime Lannister remained at Winterfell, as did the </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">queen.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Renly was not slow to take the implication. “So you believe the boy caught them at their </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="77" height="15" font="1">incest . . .” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I beg you, my lord, grant me leave to go to your brother Stannis and tell him what I </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">suspect.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="111" height="15" font="1">“To what end?” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Robb will set aside his crown if you and your brother will do the same,” she said, </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hoping it was true. She would <i>make</i> it true if she must; Robb would listen to her, even if his </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lords would not. “Let the three of you call for a Great Council, such as the realm has not seen </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">for a hundred years. We will send to Winterfell, so Bran may tell his tale and all men may </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">know the Lannisters for the true usurpers. Let the assembled lords of the Seven Kingdoms </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">choose who shall rule them.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Renly laughed. “Tell me, my lady, do direwolves vote on who should lead the pack?” </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Brienne brought the king’s gauntlets and greathelm, crowned with golden antlers that would </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">add a foot and a half to his height. “The time for talk is done. Now we see who is stronger.” </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Renly pulled a lobstered green-and-gold gauntlet over his left hand, while Brienne knelt to </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">buckle on his belt, heavy with the weight of longsword and dagger. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I beg you in the name of the Mother,” Catelyn began when a sudden gust of wind flung </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">open the door of the tent. She thought she glimpsed movement, but when she turned her head, </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">it was only the king’s shadow shifting against the silken walls. She heard Renly begin a jest, </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his shadow moving, lifting its sword, black on green, candles guttering, shivering, something </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was queer, wrong, and then she saw Renly’s sword still in its scabbard, sheathed still, but the </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">shadowsword . . . </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Cold,” said Renly in a small puzzled voice, a heartbeat before the steel of his gorget </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">parted like cheesecloth beneath the shadow of a blade that was not there. He had time to make </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="455" height="15" font="1">a small thick gasp before the blood came gushing out of his throat. </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your Gr—<i>no!</i>” cried Brienne the Blue when she saw that evil flow, sounding as scared </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">strength held him up. She threw back her head and screamed, wordless in her anguish. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>The shadow.</i> Something dark and evil had happened here, she knew, something that she </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could not begin to understand. <i>Renly never cast that shadow. Death came in that door and </i></text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="5"><i>blew the life out of him as swift as the wind snuffed out his candles.</i> </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Only a few instants passed before Robar Royce and Emmon Cuy came bursting in, </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though it felt like half the night. A pair of men-at-arms crowded in behind with torches. When </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they saw Renly in Brienne’s arms, and her drenched with the king’s blood, Ser Robar gave a </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cry of horror. “Wicked woman!” screamed Ser Emmon, he of the sun-flowered steel. “Away </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">from him, you vile creature!” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="338" height="15" font="1">“Gods be good, Brienne, <i>why</i>?” asked Ser Robar. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Brienne looked up from her king’s body. The rainbow cloak that hung from her shoulders </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">had turned red where the king’s blood had soaked into the cloth. “I . . . I . . .” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“You’ll die for this.” Ser Emmon snatched up a long-handled battleaxe from the weapons </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">piled near the door. “You’ll pay for the king’s life with your own!” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>NO!</i>” Catelyn Stark screamed, finding her voice at last, but it was too late, the blood </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">madness was on them, and they rushed forward with shouts that drowned her softer words. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Brienne moved faster than Catelyn would have believed. Her own sword was not to </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hand, so she snatched Renly’s from its scabbard and raised it to catch Emmon’s axe on the </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">downswing. A spark flashed blue-white as steel met steel with a rending crash, and Brienne </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sprang to her feet, the body of the dead king thrust rudely aside. Ser Emmon stumbled over it </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as he tried to close, and Brienne’s blade sheared through the wooden haft to send his axehead </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spinning. Another man thrust a flaming torch at her back, but the rainbow cloak was too </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sodden with blood to burn. Brienne spun and cut, and torch and hand went flying. Flames </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">crept across the carpet. The maimed man began to scream. Ser Emmon dropped the axe and </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fumbled for his sword. The second man-at-arms lunged, Brienne parried, and their swords </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">danced and clanged against each other. When Emmon Cuy came wading back in, Brienne was </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forced to retreat, yet somehow she held them both at bay. On the ground, Renly’s head rolled </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sickeningly to one side, and a second mouth yawned wide, the blood coming from him now in </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">slow pulses. </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Robar had hung back, uncertain, but now he was reaching for his hilt. “Robar, no, </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">listen.” Catelyn seized his arm. “You do her wrong, it was not her. <i>Help her!</i> Hear me, it was </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis.” The name was on her lips before she could think how it got there, but as she said it, </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">she knew that it was true. “I swear it, you know me, it was <i>Stannis</i> killed him.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The young rainbow knight stared at this madwoman with pale and frightened eyes. </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">“Stannis? How?” </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I do not know. Sorcery, some dark magic, there was a shadow, a <i>shadow</i>.” Her own </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">voice sounded wild and crazed to her, but the words poured out in a rush as the blades </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">continued to clash behind her. “A shadow with a sword, I swear it, I saw. Are you blind, the </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">girl  <i>loved</i> him! <i>Help her!</i>” She glanced back, saw the second guardsman fall, his blade </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dropping from limp fingers. Outside there was shouting. More angry men would be bursting </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">in on them any instant, she knew. “She is innocent, Robar. You have my word, on my </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">husband’s grave and my honor as a Stark!” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">That resolved him. “I will hold them,” Ser Robar said. “Get her away.” He turned and </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">went out. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The fire had reached the wall and was creeping up the side of the tent. Ser Emmon was </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pressing Brienne hard, him in his enameled yellow steel and her in wool. He had forgotten </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Catelyn, until the iron brazier came crashing into the back of his head. Helmed as he was, the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">blow did no lasting harm, but it sent him to his knees. “Brienne, with me,” Catelyn </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">commanded. The girl was not slow to see the chance. A slash, and the green silk parted. They </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stepped out into darkness and the chill of dawn. Loud voices came from the other side of the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pavilion. “This way,” Catelyn urged, “and slowly. We must not run, or they will ask why. </text>

<text top="265" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Brienne thrust her sword blade through her belt and fell in beside Catelyn. The night air </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smelled of rain. Behind them, the king’s pavilion was well ablaze, flames rising high against </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the dark. No one made any move to stop them. Men rushed past them, shouting of fire and </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">murder and sorcery. Others stood in small groups and spoke in low voices. A few were </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="1">praying, and one young squire was on his knees, sobbing openly. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Renly’s battles were already coming apart as the rumors spread from mouth to mouth. </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The nightfires had burned low, and as the east began to lighten the immense mass of Storm’s </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">End emerged like a dream of stone while wisps of pale mist raced across the field, flying from </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the sun on wings of wind. <i>Morning ghosts</i>, she had heard Old Nan call them once, spirits </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">returning to their graves. And Renly one of them now, gone like his brother Robert, like her </text>

<text top="491" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I never held him but as he died,” Brienne said quietly as they walked through the </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">spreading chaos. Her voice sounded as if she might break at any instant. “He was laughing </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one moment, and suddenly the blood was everywhere . . . my lady, I do not understand. Did </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">you see, did you . . . ?” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="591" height="15" font="1">“I saw a shadow. I thought it was Renly’s shadow at the first, but it was his brother’s.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="114" height="15" font="1">“Lord Stannis?” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="291" height="15" font="1">“I <i>felt</i> him. It makes no sense, I know . . .” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It made sense enough for Brienne. “I will kill him,” the tall homely girl declared. “With </text>

<text top="695" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hal Mollen and the rest of her escort were waiting with the horses. Ser Wendel Manderly </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was all in a lather to know what was happening. “My lady, the camp has gone mad,” he </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blurted when he saw them. “Lord Renly, is he—” He stopped suddenly, staring at Brienne and </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="1">the blood that drenched her. </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“Dead, but not by our hands.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="235" height="15" font="1">“The battle—” Hal Mollen began. </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There will be no battle.” Catelyn mounted, and her escort formed up about her, with Ser </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Wendel to her left and Ser Perwyn Frey on her right. “Brienne, we brought mounts enough for </text>

<text top="892" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“I have my own horse, my lady. And my armor—” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Leave them. We must be well away before they think to look for us. We were both with </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the king when he was killed. That will not be forgotten.” Wordless, Brienne turned and did as </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she was bid. “Ride,” Catelyn commanded her escort when they were all ahorse. “If any man </text>

<text top="352" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heights visible from miles off. The wildlings called it the Fist of the First Men, rangers said. It </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>did</i> look like a fist, Jon Snow thought, punching up through earth and wood, its bare brown </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="191" height="15" font="1">slopes knuckled with stone. </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He rode to the top with Lord Mormont and the officers, leaving Ghost below under the </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">trees. The direwolf had run off three times as they climbed, twice returning reluctantly to </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jon’s whistle. The third time, the Lord Commander lost patience and snapped, “Let him go, </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">boy. I want to reach the crest before dusk. Find the wolf later.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The way up was steep and stony, the summit crowned by a chest-high wall of tumbled </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rocks. They had to circle some distance west before they found a gap large enough to admit </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the horses. “This is good ground, Thoren,” the Old Bear proclaimed when at last they attained </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the top. “We could scarce hope for better. We’ll make our camp here to await Halfhand.” The </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Lord Commander swung down off his saddle, dislodging the raven from his shoulder. </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">Complaining loudly, the bird took to the air. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The views atop the hill were bracing, yet it was the ringwall that drew Jon’s eye, the </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weathered grey stones with their white patches of lichen, their beards of green moss. It was </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">said that the Fist had been a ringfort of the First Men in the Dawn Age. “An old place, and </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">strong,” Thoren Smallwood said. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“<i>Old</i>,” Mormont’s raven screamed as it flapped in noisy circles about their heads. “<i>Old, </i></text>

<text top="750" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Quiet,” Mormont growled up at the bird. The Old Bear was too proud to admit to </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weakness, but Jon was not deceived. The strain of keeping up with younger men was taking </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">its toll. </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“These heights will be easy to defend, if need be,” Thoren pointed out as he walked his </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">horse along the ring of stones, his sable-trimmed cloak stirring in the wind. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes, this place will do.” The Old Bear lifted a hand to the wind, and the raven landed on </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">his forearm, claws scrabbling against his black ringmail. </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="312" height="15" font="1">“What about water, my lord?” Jon wondered. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="300" height="15" font="1">“We crossed a brook at the foot of the hill.” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="524" height="15" font="1">“A long climb for a drink,” Jon pointed out, “and outside the ring of stones.” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="1">Thoren said, “Are you too lazy to climb a hill, boy?” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When Lord Mormont said, “We’re not like to find another place as strong. We’ll carry </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">water, and make certain we are well supplied,” Jon knew better than to argue. So the </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">command was given, and the brothers of the Night’s Watch raised their camp behind the stone </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them fed and watered. Foresters took their axes to the trees in the waning afternoon light to </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">harvest enough wood to see them through the night. A score of builders set to clearing brush, </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">digging latrines, and untying their bundles of fire-hardened stakes. “I will have every opening </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">in the ringwall ditched and staked before dark,” the Old Bear had commanded. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Once he’d put up the Lord Commander’s tent and seen to their horses, Jon Snow </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">descended the hill in search of Ghost. The direwolf came at once, all in silence. One moment </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jon was striding beneath the trees, whistling and shouting, alone in the green, pinecones and </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fallen leaves under his feet; the next, the great white direwolf was walking beside him, pale as </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">morning mist. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">But when they reached the ringfort, Ghost balked again. He padded forward warily to </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sniff at the gap in the stones, and then retreated, as if he did not like what he’d smelled. Jon </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tried to grab him by the scruff of his neck and haul him bodily inside the ring, no easy task; </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the wolf weighed as much as he did, and was stronger by far. “Ghost, what’s <i>wrong</i> with </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">you?” It was not like him to be so unsettled. In the end Jon had to give it up. “As you will,” he </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">told the wolf. “Go, hunt.” The red eyes watched him as he made his way back through the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">mossy stones. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They ought to be safe here. The hill offered commanding views, and the slopes were </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">precipitous to the north and west and only slightly more gentle to the east. Yet as the dusk </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">deepened and darkness seeped into the hollows between the trees, Jon’s sense of foreboding </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grew. <i>This is the haunted forest</i>, he told himself. <i>Maybe there are ghosts here, the spirits of </i></text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="5"><i>the First Men. This was their place, once.</i> </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Stop acting the boy,” he told himself. Clambering atop the piled rocks, Jon gazed off </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">toward the setting sun. He could see the light shimmering like hammered gold off the surface </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the Milkwater as it curved away to the south. Upriver the land was more rugged, the dense </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forest giving way to a series of bare stony hills that rose high and wild to the north and west. </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">On the horizon stood the mountains like a great shadow, range on range of them receding into </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the blue-grey distance, their jagged peaks sheathed eternally in snow. Even from afar they </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">looked vast and cold and inhospitable. </text>
<text top="697" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Closer at hand, it was the trees that ruled. To south and east the wood went on as far as </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jon could see, a vast tangle of root and limb painted in a thousand shades of green, with here </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and there a patch of red where a weirwood shouldered through the pines and sentinels, or a </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blush of yellow where some broadleafs had begun to turn. When the wind blew, he could hear </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the creak and groan of branches older than he was. A thousand leaves fluttered, and for a </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">moment the forest seemed a deep green sea, storm-tossed and heaving, eternal and </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="91" height="15" font="1">unknowable. </text>
<text top="839" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ghost was not like to be alone down there, he thought. Anything could be moving under </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that sea, creeping toward the ringfort through the dark of the wood, concealed beneath those </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">trees.  <i>Anything.</i> How would they ever know? He stood there for a long time, until the sun </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="1">vanished behind the saw-toothed mountains and darkness began to creep through the forest. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="533" height="15" font="1">“Jon?” Samwell Tarly called up. “I thought it looked like you. Are you well?” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="426" height="15" font="1">“Well enough.” Jon hopped down. “How did you fare today?” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="189" height="15" font="1">“Well. I fared well. Truly.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon was not about to share his disquiet with his friend, not when Samwell Tarly was at </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">last beginning to find his courage. “The Old Bear means to wait here for Qhorin Halfhand and </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">the men from the Shadow Tower.” </text>
</page>
<page number="272" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It seems a strong place,” said Sam. “A ringfort of the First Men. Do you think there </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">were battles fought here?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="548" height="15" font="1">“No doubt. You’d best get a bird ready. Mormont will want to send back word.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="373" height="15" font="1">“I wish I could send them all. They hate being caged.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="238" height="15" font="1">“You would too, if you could fly.” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="489" height="15" font="1">“If I could fly, I’d be back at Castle Black eating a pork pie,” said Sam. </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon clapped him on the shoulder with his burned hand. They walked back through the </text>
<text top="269" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">camp together. Cookfires were being lit all around them. Overhead, the stars were coming </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">out. The long red tail of Mormont’s Torch burned as bright as the moon. Jon heard the ravens </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">before he saw them. Some were calling his name. The birds were not shy when it came to </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="1">making noise. </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>They feel it too.</i> “I’d best see to the Old Bear,” he said. “He gets noisy when he isn’t fed </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">as well.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He found Mormont talking with Thoren Smallwood and half a dozen other officers. </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“There you are,” the old man said gruffly. “Bring us some hot wine, if you would. The night </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">is chilly.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lord.” Jon built a cookfire, claimed a small cask of Mormont’s favorite robust </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">red from stores, and poured it into a kettle. He hung the kettle above the flames while he </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gathered the rest of his ingredients. The Old Bear was particular about his hot spiced wine. So </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">much cinnamon and so much nutmeg and so much honey, not a drop more. Raisins and nuts </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and dried berries, but no lemon, that was the rankest sort of southron heresy—which was </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">queer, since he always took lemon in his morning beer. The drink must be hot to warm a man </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">properly, the Lord Commander insisted, but the wine must never be allowed to come to a boil. </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">Jon kept a careful eye on the kettle. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As he worked, he could hear the voices from inside the tent. Jarman Buckwell said, “The </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">easiest road up into the Frostfangs is to follow the Milkwater back to its source. Yet if we go </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">that path, Rayder will know of our approach, certain as sunrise.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The Giant’s Stair might serve,” said Ser Mallador Locke, “or the Skirling Pass, if it’s </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">clear.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The wine was steaming. Jon lifted the kettle off the fire, filled eight cups, and carried </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them into the tent. The Old Bear was peering at the crude map Sam had drawn him that night </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back in Craster’s Keep. He took a cup from Jon’s tray, tried a swallow of wine, and gave a </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">brusque nod of approval. His raven hopped down his arm. “<i>Corn</i>,” it said. “<i>Corn. Corn.</i>” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Ottyn Wythers waved the wine away. “I would not go into the mountains at all,” he </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">said in a thin, tired voice. “The Frostfangs have a cruel bite even in summer, and now . . . if </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="252" height="15" font="1">we should be caught by a storm . . .” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I do not mean to risk the Frostfangs unless I must,” said Mormont. “Wildlings can no </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">more live on snow and stone than we can. They will emerge from the heights soon, and for a </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">host of any size, the only route is along the Milkwater. If so, we are strongly placed here. </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">They cannot hope to slip by us.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They may not wish to. They are thousands, and we will be three hundred when the </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">Halfhand reaches us.” Ser Mallador accepted a cup from Jon. </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If it comes to battle, we could not hope for better ground than here,” declared Mormont. </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“We’ll strengthen the defenses. Pits and spikes, caltrops scattered on the slopes, every breach </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mended. Jarman, I’ll want your sharpest eyes as watchers. A ring of them, all around us and </text>
<text top="1065" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">along the river, to warn of any approach. Hide them up in trees. And we had best start </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bringing up water too, more than we need. We’ll dig cisterns. It will keep the men occupied, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">and may prove needful later.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“My rangers—” started Thoren Smallwood. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your rangers will limit their ranging to this side of the river until the Halfhand reaches </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="393" height="15" font="1">us. After that, we’ll see. I will not lose more of my men.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Mance Rayder might be massing his host a day’s ride from here, and we’d never know,” </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">Smallwood complained. </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We know where the wildlings are massing,” Mormont came back. “We had it from </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="450" height="15" font="1">Craster. I mislike the man, but I do not think he lied to us in this.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“As you say.” Smallwood took a sullen leave. The others finished their wine and </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">followed, more courteously. </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="327" height="15" font="1">“Shall I bring you supper, my lord?” Jon asked. </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Corn</i>,” the raven cried. Mormont did not answer at once. When he did he said only, </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="1">“Did your wolf find game today?” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="143" height="15" font="1">“He’s not back yet.” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We could do with fresh meat.” Mormont dug into a sack and offered his raven a handful </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">of corn. “You think I’m wrong to keep the rangers close?” </text>
<text top="492" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">“That’s not for me to say, my lord.” </text>
<text top="517" left="171" width="155" height="15" font="1">“It is if you’re asked.” </text>
<text top="542" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If the rangers must stay in sight of the Fist, I don’t see how they can hope to find my </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="148" height="15" font="1">uncle,” Jon admitted. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They can’t.” The raven pecked at the kernels in the Old Bear’s palm. “Two hundred </text>
<text top="606" left="139" width="634" height="15" font="1">men or ten thousand, the country is too vast.” The corn gone, Mormont turned his hand over. </text>
<text top="631" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“You would not give up the search?” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Maester Aemon thinks you clever.” Mormont moved the raven to his shoulder. The bird </text>
<text top="676" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">tilted its head to one side, little eyes aglitter. </text>
<text top="701" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The answer was there. “Is it . . . it seems to me that it might be easier for one man to find </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">two hundred than for two hundred to find one.” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The raven gave a cackling scream, but the Old Bear smiled through the grey of his beard. </text>
<text top="765" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“This many men and horses leave a trail even Aemon could follow. On this hill, our fires </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ought to be visible as far off as the foothills of the Frostfangs. If Ben Stark is alive and free, </text>
<text top="804" left="139" width="255" height="15" font="1">he will come to us, I have no doubt.” </text>
<text top="829" left="171" width="257" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” said Jon, “but . . . what if . . .” </text>
<text top="854" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“. . . he’s dead?” Mormont asked, not unkindly. </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="167" height="15" font="1">Jon nodded, reluctantly. </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="268" height="15" font="1">“<i>Dead</i>,” the raven said. “<i>Dead. Dead.</i>” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He may come to us anyway,” the Old Bear said. “As Othor did, and Jafer Flowers. I </text>
<text top="949" left="139" width="457" height="15" font="1">dread that as much as you, Jon, but we must admit the possibility.” </text>
<text top="974" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“<i>Dead</i>,” his raven cawed, ruffling its wings. Its voice grew louder and more shrill. </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">“<i>Dead.</i>” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Mormont stroked the bird’s black feathers, and stifled a sudden yawn with the back of his </text>
<text top="1038" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">hand. “I will forsake supper, I believe. Rest will serve me better. Wake me at first light.” </text>
</page>
<page number="274" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sleep well, my lord.” Jon gathered up the empty cups and stepped outside. He heard </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">distant laughter, the plaintive sound of pipes. A great blaze was crackling in the center of the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">camp, and he could smell stew cooking. The Old Bear might not be hungry, but Jon was. He </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">drifted over toward the fire. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dywen was holding forth, spoon in hand. “I know this wood as well as any man alive, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="563" height="15" font="1">and I tell you, I wouldn’t care to ride through it alone tonight. Can’t you smell it?” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Grenn was staring at him with wide eyes, but Dolorous Edd said, “All I smell is the shit </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="643" height="15" font="1">of two hundred horses. And this stew. Which has a similar aroma, now that I come to sniff it.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ve got your <i>similar aroma</i> right here.” Hake patted his dirk. Grumbling, he filled Jon’s </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="146" height="15" font="1">bowl from the kettle. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The stew was thick with barley, carrot, and onion, with here and there a ragged shred of </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">salt beef, softened in the cooking. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“What is it you smell, Dywen?” asked Grenn. </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The forester sucked on his spoon a moment. He had taken out his teeth. His face was </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="655" height="15" font="1">leathery and wrinkled, his hands gnarled as old roots. “Seems to me like it </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">smells . . . well . . . <i>cold</i>.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="567" height="15" font="1">“Your head’s as wooden as your teeth,” Hake told him. “There’s no smell to cold.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>There is</i>, thought Jon, remembering the night in the Lord Commander’s chambers. <i>It </i></text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>smells like death.</i> Suddenly he was not hungry anymore. He gave his stew to Grenn, who </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">looked in need of an extra supper to warm him against the night. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The wind was blowing briskly when he left. By morning, frost would cover the ground, </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and the tent ropes would be stiff and frozen. A few fingers of spiced wine sloshed in the </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">bottom of the kettle. Jon fed fresh wood to the fire and put the kettle over the flames to reheat. </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He flexed his fingers as he waited, squeezing and spreading until the hand tingled. The first </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">watch had taken up their stations around the perimeter of the camp. Torches flickered all </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">along the ringwall. The night was moonless, but a thousand stars shone overhead. </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A sound rose out of the darkness, faint and distant, but unmistakable: the howling of </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wolves. Their voices rose and fell, a chilly song, and lonely. It made the hairs rise along the </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back of his neck. Across the fire, a pair of red eyes regarded him from the shadows. The light </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">of the flames made them glow. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Ghost,” Jon breathed, surprised. “So you came inside after all, eh?” The white wolf </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">often hunted all night; he had not expected to see him again till daybreak. “Was the hunting so </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">bad?” he asked. “Here. To me, Ghost.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The direwolf circled the fire, sniffing Jon, sniffing the wind, never still. It did not seem as </text>

<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>warned me.</i> Alarmed, he got to his feet. “Is something out there? Ghost, do you have a scent?” </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="5"><i>Dywen said he smelled cold.</i> </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The direwolf loped off, stopped, looked back. <i>He wants me to follow.</i> Pulling up the hood </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of his cloak, Jon walked away from the tents, away from the warmth of his fire, past the lines </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of shaggy little garrons. One of the horses whickered nervously when Ghost padded by. Jon </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">soothed him with a word and paused to stroke his muzzle. He could hear the wind whistling </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through cracks in the rocks as they neared the ringwall. A voice called out a challenge. Jon </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">stepped into the torchlight. “I need to fetch water for the Lord Commander.” </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Go on, then,” the guard said. “Be quick about it.” Huddled beneath his black cloak, with </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon slipped sideways between two sharpened stakes while Ghost slid beneath them. A </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">torch had been thrust down into a crevice, its flames flying pale orange banners when the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gusts came. He snatched it up as he squeezed through the gap between the stones. Ghost went </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">racing down the hill. Jon followed more slowly, the torch thrust out before him as he made his </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">descent. The camp sounds faded behind him. The night was black, the slope steep, stony, and </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">uneven. A moment’s inattention would be a sure way to break an ankle . . . or his neck. <i>What </i></text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="395" height="15" font="5"><i>am I doing?</i> he asked himself as he picked his way down. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The trees stood beneath him, warriors armored in bark and leaf, deployed in their silent </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ranks awaiting the command to storm the hill. Black, they seemed . . . it was only when his </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">torchlight brushed against them that Jon glimpsed a flash of green. Faintly, he heard the sound </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of water flowing over rocks. Ghost vanished in the underbrush. Jon struggled after him, </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">listening to the call of the brook, to the leaves sighing in the wind. Branches clutched at his </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="495" height="15" font="1">cloak, while overhead thick limbs twined together and shut out the stars. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He found Ghost lapping from the stream. “<i>Ghost</i>,” he called, “to me. <i>Now.</i>” When the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">direwolf raised his head, his eyes glowed red and baleful, and water streamed down from his </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">jaws like slaver. There was something fierce and terrible about him in that instant. And then </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he was off, bounding past Jon, racing through the trees. “Ghost, <i>no</i>, stay,” he shouted, but the </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wolf paid no heed. The lean white shape was swallowed by the dark, and Jon had only two </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">choices—to climb the hill again, alone, or to follow. </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He followed, angry, holding the torch out low so he could see the rocks that threatened to </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trip him with every step, the thick roots that seemed to grab at his feet, the holes where a man </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">could twist an ankle. Every few feet he called again for Ghost, but the night wind was </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swirling amongst the trees and it drank the words. <i>This is madness</i>, he thought as he plunged </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deeper into the trees. He was about to turn back when he glimpsed a flash of white off ahead </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">and to the right, back toward the hill. He jogged after it, cursing under his breath. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A quarter-way around the Fist he chased the wolf before he lost him again. Finally he </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stopped to catch his breath amidst the scrub, thorns, and tumbled rocks at the base of the hill. </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="314" height="15" font="1">Beyond the torchlight, the dark pressed close. </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A soft scrabbling noise made him turn. Jon moved toward the sound, stepping carefully </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">among boulders and thornbushes. Behind a fallen tree, he came on Ghost again. The direwolf </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">was digging furiously, kicking up dirt. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What have you found?” Jon lowered the torch, revealing a rounded mound of soft earth. </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="225" height="15" font="5"><i>A grave</i>, he thought. <i>But whose?</i> </text>
<text top="786" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He knelt, jammed the torch into the ground beside him. The soil was loose, sandy. Jon </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pulled it out by the fistful. There were no stones, no roots. Whatever was here had been put </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">here recently. Two feet down, his fingers touched cloth. He had been expecting a corpse, </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fearing a corpse, but this was something else. He pushed against the fabric and felt small, hard </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shapes beneath, unyielding. There was no smell, no sign of graveworms. Ghost backed off </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">and sat on his haunches, watching. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon brushed the loose soil away to reveal a rounded bundle perhaps two feet across. He </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">jammed his fingers down around the edges and worked it loose. When he pulled it free, </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whatever was inside shifted and clinked. <i>Treasure</i>, he thought, but the shapes were wrong to </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="311" height="15" font="1">be coins, and the <i>sound</i> was wrong for metal. </text>
<text top="992" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A length of frayed rope bound the bundle together. Jon unsheathed his dagger and cut it, </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">groped for the edges of the cloth, and pulled. The bundle turned, and its contents spilled out </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">onto the ground, glittering dark and bright. He saw a dozen knives, leaf-shaped spearheads, </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">numerous arrowheads. Jon picked up a dagger blade, feather-light and shiny black, hiltless. </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Torchlight ran along its edge, a thin orange line that spoke of razor sharpness. <i>Dragonglass. </i></text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>What the maesters call obsidian.</i> Had Ghost uncovered some ancient cache of the children of </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beneath the dragonglass was an old warhorn, made from an auroch’s horn and banded in </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bronze. Jon shook the dirt from inside it, and a stream of arrowheads fell out. He let them fall, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and pulled up a corner of the cloth the weapons had been wrapped in, rubbing it between his </text>

<text top="411" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Alebelly found him in the forge, working the bellows for Mikken. “Maester wants you in </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="415" height="15" font="1">the turret, m’lord prince. There’s been a bird from the king.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“From Robb?” Excited, Bran did not wait for Hodor, but let Alebelly carry him up the </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">steps. He was a big man, though not so big as Hodor and nowhere near as strong. By the time </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they reached the maester’s turret he was red-faced and puffing. Rickon was there before them, </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">and both Walder Freys as well. </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin sent Alebelly away and closed his door. “My lords,” he said gravely, “we </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have had a message from His Grace, with both good news and ill. He has won a great victory </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in the west, shattering a Lannister army at a place named Oxcross, and has taken several </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="623" height="15" font="1">castles as well. He writes us from Ashemark, formerly the stronghold of House Marbrand.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="429" height="15" font="1">Rickon tugged at the maester’s robe. “Is Robb coming home?” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“Not just yet, I fear. There are battles yet to fight.” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“Was it Lord Tywin he defeated?” asked Bran. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No,” said the maester. “Ser Stafford Lannister commanded the enemy host. He was </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">slain in the battle.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran had never even heard of Ser Stafford Lannister. He found himself agreeing with Big </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="447" height="15" font="1">Walder when he said, “Lord Tywin is the only one who matters.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Tell Robb I want him to come home,” said Rickon. “He can bring his wolf home too, </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">and Mother and Father.” Though he knew Lord Eddard was dead, sometimes Rickon </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forgot . . . willfully, Bran suspected. His little brother was stubborn as only a boy of four can </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="24" height="15" font="1">be. </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran was glad for Robb’s victory, but disquieted as well. He remembered what Osha had </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">said the day that his brother had led his army out of Winterfell. <i>He’s marching the wrong way</i>, </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">the wildling woman had insisted. </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Sadly, no victory is without cost.” Maester Luwin turned to the Walders. “My lords, </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">your uncle Ser Stevron Frey was among those who lost their lives at Oxcross. He took a </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wound in the battle, Robb writes. It was not thought to be serious, but three days later he died </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">in his tent, asleep.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Big Walder shrugged. “He was very old. Five-and-sixty, I think. Too old for battles. He </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">was always saying he was tired.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Little Walder hooted. “Tired of waiting for our grandfather to die, you mean. Does this </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Don’t be stupid,” his cousin said. “The sons of the first son come before the second son. </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ser Ryman is next in line, and then Edwyn and Black Walder and Petyr Pimple. And then </text>

<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ryman is old too,” said Little Walder. “Past forty, I bet. And he has a bad belly. Do you </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“<i>I’ll</i> be lord. I don’t care if he is.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin cut in sharply. “You ought to be ashamed of such talk, my lords. Where </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="238" height="15" font="1">is your grief? Your uncle is dead.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” said Little Walder. “We’re very sad.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They weren’t, though. Bran got a sick feeling in his belly. <i>They like the taste of this dish </i></text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="388" height="15" font="5"><i>better than I do.</i> He asked Maester Luwin to be excused. </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Very well.” The maester rang for help. Hodor must have been busy in the stables. It was </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Osha who came. She was stronger than Alebelly, though, and had no trouble lifting Bran in </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">her arms and carrying him down the steps. </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Osha,” Bran asked as they crossed the yard. “Do you know the way north? To the Wall </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">and . . . and even past?” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The way’s easy. Look for the Ice Dragon, and chase the blue star in the rider’s eye.” She </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="382" height="15" font="1">backed through a door and started up the winding steps. </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And  there  are  still  giants  there,  and . . . the  rest . . . the  Others,  and  the  children  of  the </text>

<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The giants I’ve seen, the children I’ve heard tell of, and the white walkers . . . why do </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">you want to know?” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="267" height="15" font="1">“Did you ever see a three-eyed crow?” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No.” She laughed. “And I can’t say I’d want to.” Osha kicked open the door to his </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">bedchamber and set him in his window seat, where he could watch the yard below. </text>
<text top="709" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It seemed only a few heartbeats after she took her leave that the door opened again, and </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jojen Reed entered unbidden, with his sister Meera behind him. “You heard about the bird?” </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Bran asked. The other boy nodded. “It wasn’t a supper like you said. It was a letter from </text>

<text top="792" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The green dreams take strange shapes sometimes,” Jojen admitted. “The truth of them is </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">not always easy to understand.” </text>
<text top="837" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Tell me the bad thing you dreamed,” Bran said. “The bad thing that is coming to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Mikken?” Bran was as confused as he was dismayed. “But the sea is hundreds and </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">“It will not save them,” replied the boy in green. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Meera came to the window seat and put a hand on his shoulder. “They will not believe, </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">Bran. No more than you did.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="354" height="15" font="1">Jojen sat on Bran’s bed. “Tell me what <i>you</i> dream.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He was scared, even then, but he had sworn to trust them, and a Stark of Winterfell keeps </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his sworn word. “There’s different kinds,” he said slowly. “There’s the wolf dreams, those </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">aren’t so bad as the others. I run and hunt and kill squirrels. And there’s dreams where the </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crow comes and tells me to fly. Sometimes the tree is in those dreams too, calling my name. </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">That frightens me. But the worst dreams are when I fall.” He looked down into the yard, </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">feeling miserable. “I never used to fall before. When I climbed, I went everyplace, up on the </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">roofs and along the walls, I used to feed the crows in the Burned Tower. Mother was afraid </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that I would fall but I knew I never would. Only I did, and now when I sleep I fall all the </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">time.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">Meera gave his shoulder a squeeze. “Is that all?” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="71" height="15" font="1">“I guess.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">“<i>Warg</i>,” said Jojen Reed. </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">Bran looked at him, his eyes wide. “What?” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Warg. Shapechanger. Beastling. That is what they will call you, if they should ever hear </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">of your wolf dreams.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="380" height="15" font="1">The names made him afraid again. “<i>Who</i> will call me?” </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your own folk. In fear. Some will hate you if they know what you are. Some will even </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">try to kill you.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Old Nan told scary stories of beastlings and shapechangers sometimes. In the stories they </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">were always evil. “I’m not like that,” Bran said. “I’m <i>not</i>. It’s only dreams.” </text>
<text top="837" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The wolf dreams are no true dreams. You have your eye closed tight whenever you’re </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">awake, but as you drift off it flutters open and your soul seeks out its other half. The power is </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">strong in you.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="267" height="15" font="1">“I don’t want it. I want to be a <i>knight</i>.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A knight is what you want. A warg is what you are. You can’t change that, Bran, you </text>
<text top="946" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">can’t deny it or push it away. You are the winged wolf, but you will never fly.” Jojen got up </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and walked to the window. “Unless you <i>open your eye</i>.” He put two fingers together and </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">poked Bran in the forehead, hard. </text>
<text top="1010" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When he raised his hand to the spot, Bran felt only the smooth unbroken skin. There was </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">no eye, not even a closed one. “How can I open it if it’s not there?” </text>
</page>
<page number="279" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You will never find the eye with your fingers, Bran. You must search with your heart.” </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">Jojen studied Bran’s face with those strange green eyes. “Or are you afraid?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="478" height="15" font="1">“Maester Luwin says there’s nothing in dreams that a man need fear.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="154" height="15" font="1">“There is,” said Jojen. </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="63" height="15" font="1">“What?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="232" height="15" font="1">“The past. The future. The truth.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They left him more muddled than ever. When he was alone, Bran tried to open his third </text>
<text top="269" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">eye, but he didn’t know how. No matter how he wrinkled his forehead and poked at it, he </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">couldn’t see any different than he’d done before. In the days that followed, he tried to warn </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">others about what Jojen had seen, but it didn’t go as he wanted. Mikken thought it was funny. </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“The sea, is it? Happens I always wanted to see the sea. Never got where I could go to it, </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">though. So now it’s coming to me, is it? The gods are good, to take such trouble for a poor </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="54" height="15" font="1">smith.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“The gods will take me when they see fit,” Septon Chayle said quietly, “though I scarcely </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">think it likely that I’ll drown, Bran. I grew up on the banks of the White Knife, you know. I’m </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">quite the strong swimmer.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Alebelly was the only one who paid the warning any heed. He went to talk to Jojen </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">himself, and afterward stopped bathing and refused to go near the well. Finally he stank so </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bad that six of the other guards threw him into a tub of scalding water and scrubbed him raw </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">while he screamed that they were going to drown him like the frogboy had said. Thereafter he </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="601" height="15" font="1">scowled whenever he saw Bran or Jojen about the castle, and muttered under his breath. </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was a few days after Alebelly’s bath that Ser Rodrik returned to Winterfell with his </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">prisoner, a fleshy young man with fat moist lips and long hair who smelled like a privy, even </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">worse than Alebelly had. “Reek, he’s called,” Hayhead said when Bran asked who it was. “I </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">never heard his true name. He served the Bastard of Bolton and helped him murder Lady </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">Hornwood, they say.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Bastard himself was dead, Bran learned that evening over supper. Ser Rodrik’s men </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had caught him on Hornwood land doing something horrible (Bran wasn’t quite sure what, </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but it seemed to be something you did without your clothes) and shot him down with arrows </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as he tried to ride away. They came too late for poor Lady Hornwood, though. After their </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wedding, the Bastard had locked her in a tower and neglected to feed her. Bran had heard men </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">saying that when Ser Rodrik had smashed down the door he found her with her mouth all </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">bloody and her fingers chewed off. </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The monster has tied us a thorny knot,” the old knight told Maester Luwin. “Like it or </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">no, Lady Hornwood was his wife. He made her say the vows before both septon and heart </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tree, and bedded her that very night before witnesses. She signed a will naming him as heir </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">and fixed her seal to it.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="430" height="15" font="1">“Vows made at sword point are not valid,” the maester argued. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Roose Bolton may not agree. Not with land at issue.” Ser Rodrik looked unhappy. </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Would that I could take this serving man’s head off as well, he’s as bad as his master. But I </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fear I must keep him alive until Robb returns from his wars. He is the only witness to the </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">worst of the Bastard’s crimes. Perhaps when Lord Bolton hears his tale, he will abandon his </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">claim, but meantime we have Manderly knights and Dreadfort men killing one another in </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Hornwood forests, and I lack the strength to stop them.” The old knight turned in his seat and </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">gave Bran a stern look. “And what have you been about while I’ve been away, my lord </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">prince? Commanding our guardsmen not to wash? Do you want them smelling like this Reek, </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">is that it?” </text>
</page>
<page number="280" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The sea is coming here,” Bran said. “Jojen saw it in a green dream. Alebelly is going to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">drown.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin tugged at his chain collar. “The Reed boy believes he sees the future in </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his dreams, Ser Rodrik. I’ve spoken to Bran about the uncertainty of such prophecies, but if </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">truth be told, there is trouble along the Stony Shore. Raiders in longships, plundering fishing </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">villages. Raping and burning. Leobald Tallhart has sent his nephew Benfred to deal with </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="578" height="15" font="1">them, but I expect they’ll take to their ships and flee at the first sight of armed men.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aye, and strike somewhere else. The Others take all such cowards. They would never </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dare, no more than the Bastard of Bolton, if our main strength were not a thousand leagues </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="464" height="15" font="1">south.” Ser Rodrik looked at Bran. “What else did the lad tell you?” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He said the water would flow over our walls. He saw Alebelly drowned, and Mikken </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="170" height="15" font="1">and Septon Chayle too.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik frowned. “Well, should it happen that I need to ride against these raiders </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="573" height="15" font="1">myself, I shan’t take Alebelly, then. He didn’t see <i>me</i> drowned, did he? No? Good.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It heartened Bran to hear that. <i>Maybe they won’t drown, then</i>, he thought. <i>If they stay </i></text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="5"><i>away from the sea.</i> </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Meera thought so too, later that night when she and Jojen met Bran in his room to play a </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">three-sided game of tiles, but her brother shook his head. “The things I see in green dreams </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="131" height="15" font="1">can’t be changed.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That made his sister angry. “Why would the gods send a warning if we can’t heed it and </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">change what’s to come?” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="1">“I don’t know,” Jojen said sadly. </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you were Alebelly, you’d probably jump into the well to have done with it! He should </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="5"><i>fight</i>, and Bran should too.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">“Me?” Bran felt suddenly afraid. “What should I fight? Am I going to drown too?” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">Meera looked at him guiltily. “I shouldn’t have said . . .” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He could tell that she was hiding something. “Did you see me in a green dream?” he </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="288" height="15" font="1">asked Jojen nervously. “Was I drowned?” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Not drowned.” Jojen spoke as if every word pained him. “I dreamed of the man who </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">came today, the one they call Reek. You and your brother lay dead at his feet, and he was </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">skinning off your faces with a long red blade.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Meera rose to her feet. “If I went to the dungeon, I could drive a spear right through his </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">heart. How could he murder Bran if he was dead?” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The gaolers will stop you,” Jojen said. “The guards. And if you tell them why you want </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">him dead, they’ll never believe.” </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have guards too,” Bran reminded them. “Alebelly and Poxy Tym and Hayhead and the </text>

<text top="921" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jojen’s mossy eyes were full of pity. “They won’t be able to stop him, Bran. I couldn’t </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see why, but I saw the end of it. I saw you and Rickon in your crypts, down in the dark with </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">all the dead kings and their stone wolves.” </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>No</i>, Bran thought. <i>No.</i> “If I went away . . . to Greywater, or to the crow, someplace far </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">where they couldn’t find me . . .” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="554" height="15" font="1">“It will not matter. The dream was green, Bran, and the green dreams do not lie.” </text>

<text top="174" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">murdered most fearfully in the very midst of his army. His throat was opened from ear to ear </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">by a blade that passed through steel and bone as if they were soft cheese.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">“Murdered by whose hand?” Cersei demanded. </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Have you ever considered that too many answers are the same as no answer at all? My </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">informers are not always as highly placed as we might like. When a king dies, fancies sprout </text>

<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Rainbow Guard. A washerwoman claims Stannis stole through the heart of his brother’s army </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with his magic sword. Several men-at-arms believe a woman did the fell deed, but cannot </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The queen was not pleased. “Must you waste our time with every rumor the fools care to </text>

<text top="450" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“You pay me well for these rumors, my gracious queen.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We pay you for the truth, Lord Varys. Remember that, or this small council may grow </text>

<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Dear dear Petyr,” said Varys, “are you not concerned that yours might be the next name </text>

<text top="798" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had heard enough. “Joff will be so disappointed,” he said. “He was saving such a </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">nice spike for Renly’s head. But whoever did the deed, we must assume Stannis was behind it. </text>
<text top="837" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The gain is clearly his.” He did not like this news; he had counted on the brothers Baratheon </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">decimating each other in bloody battle. He could feel his elbow throbbing where the </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">morningstar had laid it open. It did that sometimes in the damp. He squeezed it uselessly in </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="308" height="15" font="1">his hand and asked, “What of Renly’s host?” </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The greater part of his foot remains at Bitterbridge.” Varys abandoned the brazier to </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">take his seat at the table. “Most of the lords who rode with Lord Renly to Storm’s End have </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">gone over banner-and-blade to Stannis, with all their chivalry.” </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“Led by the Florents, I’d wager,” said Littlefinger. </text>
<text top="1010" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Varys gave him a simpering smile. “You would win, my lord. Lord Alester was indeed </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">the first to bend the knee. Many others followed.” </text>
<text top="1054" left="171" width="313" height="15" font="1">“Many,” Tyrion said pointedly, “but not all?” </text>
</page>
<page number="282" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Not all,” agreed the eunuch. “Not Loras Tyrell, nor Randyll Tarly, nor Mathis Rowan. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">And Storm’s End itself has not yielded. Ser Cortnay Penrose holds the castle in Renly’s name, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and will not believe his liege is dead. He demands to see the mortal remains before he opens </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his gates, but it seems that Renly’s corpse has unaccountably vanished. Carried away, most </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">likely. A fifth of Renly’s knights departed with Ser Loras rather than bend the knee to Stannis. </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">It’s said the Knight of Flowers went mad when he saw his king’s body, and slew three of </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="507" height="15" font="1">Renly’s guards in his wrath, among them Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce.” </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="292" height="15" font="5"><i>A pity he stopped at three</i>, thought Tyrion. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ser Loras is likely making for Bitterbridge,” Varys went on. “His sister is there, Renly’s </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">queen, as well as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless. Which side </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will they take now? A ticklish question. Many serve the lords who remained at Storm’s End, </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">and those lords now belong to Stannis.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion leaned forward. “There is a chance here, it seems to me. Win Loras Tyrell to our </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cause and Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen might join us as well. They may have sworn </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">their swords to Stannis for the moment, yet they cannot love the man, or they would have </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">been his from the start.” </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">“Is their love for us any greater?” asked Cersei. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Scarcely,” said Tyrion. “They loved Renly, clearly, but Renly is slain. Perhaps we can </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">give them good and sufficient reasons to prefer Joffrey to Stannis . . . <i>if</i> we move quickly.” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“What sort of reasons do you mean to give them?” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“Gold reasons,” Littlefinger suggested at once. </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Varys made a <i>tsk</i>ing sound. “Sweet Petyr, surely you do not mean to suggest that these </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="596" height="15" font="1">puissant lords and noble knights could be <i>bought</i> like so many chickens in the market.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Have you been to our markets of late, Lord Varys?” asked Littlefinger. “You’d find it </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">easier to buy a lord than a chicken, I daresay. Of course, lords cluck prouder than chickens, </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and take it ill if you offer them coin like a tradesman, but they are seldom adverse to taking </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">gifts . . . honors, lands, castles . . .” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="572" height="15" font="1">“Bribes might sway some of the lesser lords,” Tyrion said, “but never Highgarden.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“True,” Littlefinger admitted. “The Knight of Flowers is the key there. Mace Tyrell has </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">two older sons, but Loras has always been his favorite. Win him, and Highgarden will be </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="54" height="15" font="1">yours.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Yes</i>, Tyrion thought. “It seems to me we should take a lesson from the late Lord Renly. </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="1">We can win the Tyrell alliance as he did. With a marriage.” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="579" height="15" font="1">Varys understood the quickest. “You think to wed King Joffrey to Margaery Tyrell.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“I do.” Renly’s young queen was no more than fifteen, sixteen, he seemed to </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">recall . . . older than Joffrey, but a few years were nothing, it was so neat and sweet he could </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">taste it. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark,” Cersei objected. </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Marriage contracts can be broken. What advantage is there in wedding the king to the </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">daughter of a dead traitor?” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger spoke up. “You might point out to His Grace that the Tyrells are much </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="622" height="15" font="1">wealthier than the Starks, and that Margaery is said to be lovely . . . and beddable besides.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="393" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” said Tyrion, “Joff ought to like that well enough.” </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="335" height="15" font="1">“My son is too young to care about such things.” </text>
</page>
<page number="283" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">“You think so?” asked Tyrion. “He’s thirteen, Cersei. The same age at which I married.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="511" height="15" font="1">“You shamed us all with that sorry episode. Joffrey is made of finer stuff.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“So fine that he had Ser Boros rip off Sansa’s gown.” </text>
<text top="180" left="171" width="204" height="15" font="1">“He was angry with the girl.” </text>
<text top="205" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He was angry with that cook’s boy who spilled the soup last night as well, but he didn’t </text>
<text top="224" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">strip him naked.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“This was not a matter of some spilled soup—” </text>
<text top="274" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>No, it was a matter of some pretty teats.</i> After that business in the yard, Tyrion had </text>
<text top="294" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spoken with Varys about how they might arrange for Joffrey to visit Chataya’s. A taste of </text>
<text top="313" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">honey might sweeten the boy, he hoped. He might even be <i>grateful</i>, gods forbid, and Tyrion </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could do with a shade more gratitude from his sovereign. It would need to be done secretly, of </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">course. The tricky bit would be parting him from the Hound. “The dog is never far from his </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">master’s heels,” he’d observed to Varys, “but all men sleep. And some gamble and whore and </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">visit winesinks as well.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="402" height="15" font="1">“The Hound does all these things, if that is your question.” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">“No,” said Tyrion. “My question is <i>when</i>.” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys had laid a finger on his cheek, smiling enigmatically. “My lord, a suspicious man </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">might think you wished to find a time when Sandor Clegane was not protecting King Joffrey, </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="252" height="15" font="1">the better to do the boy some harm.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Surely you know me better than that, Lord Varys,” Tyrion said. “Why, all I want is for </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">Joffrey to love me.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The eunuch had promised to look into the matter. The war made its own demands, </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though; Joffrey’s initiation into manhood would need to wait. “Doubtless you know your son </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">better than I do,” he made himself tell Cersei, “but regardless, there’s still much to be said for </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a Tyrell marriage. It may be the only way that Joffrey lives long enough to reach his wedding </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">night.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger agreed. “The Stark girl brings Joffrey nothing but her body, sweet as that </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">may be. Margaery Tyrell brings fifty thousand swords and all the strength of Highgarden.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Indeed.” Varys laid a soft hand on the queen’s sleeve. “You have a mother’s heart, and I </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">know His Grace loves his little sweetling. Yet kings must learn to put the needs of the realm </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="384" height="15" font="1">before their own desires. I say this offer must be made.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The queen pulled free of the eunuch’s touch. “You would not speak so if you were </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">women. Say what you will, my lords, but Joffrey is too proud to settle for Renly’s leavings. </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">He will never consent.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shrugged. “When the king comes of age in three years, he may give or withhold </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his consent as he pleases. Until then, you are his regent and I am his Hand, and he will marry </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="1">whomever we tell him to marry. Leavings or no.” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s quiver was empty. “Make your offer then, but gods save you all if Joff does not </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">like this girl.” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m so pleased we can agree,” Tyrion said. “Now, which of us shall go to Bitterbridge? </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">We must reach Ser Loras with our offer before his blood can cool.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="276" height="15" font="1">“You mean to send one of the council?” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I can scarcely expect the Knight of Flowers to treat with Bronn or Shagga, can I? The </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">Tyrells are proud.” </text>
</page>
<page number="284" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">His sister wasted no time trying to twist the situation to her advantage. “Ser Jacelyn </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">Bywater is nobly born. Send him.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shook his head. “We need someone who can do more than repeat our words and </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">fetch back a reply. Our envoy must speak for king and council and settle the matter quickly.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The Hand speaks with the king’s voice.” Candlelight gleamed green as wildfire in </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s eyes. “If we send you, Tyrion, it will be as if Joffrey went himself. And who better. </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="384" height="15" font="1">You wield words as skillfully as Jaime wields a sword.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Are you that eager to get me out of the city, Cersei?</i> “You are too kind, sister, but it </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seems to me that a boy’s mother is better fitted to arrange his marriage than any uncle. And </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">you have a gift for winning friends that I could never hope to match.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">Her eyes narrowed. “Joff needs me at his side.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace, my lord Hand,” said Littlefinger, “the king needs both of you here. Let me </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">go in your stead.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">“You?” <i>What gain does he see in this?</i> Tyrion wondered. </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am of the king’s council, yet not the king’s blood, so I would make a poor hostage. I </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knew Ser Loras passing well when he was here at court, and gave him no cause to mislike me. </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mace Tyrell bears me no enmity that I know of, and I flatter myself that I am not unskilled in </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="92" height="15" font="1">negotiation.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>He has us.</i> Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish, nor did he want the man out of his sight, </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">yet what other choice was left him? It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself, and he knew full </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">well that if he left King’s Landing for any length of time, all that he had managed to </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">accomplish would be undone. “There is fighting between here and Bitterbridge,” he said </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">cautiously. “And you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will be dispatching his own </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">shepherds to gather in his brother’s wayward lambs.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ve never been frightened of shepherds. It’s the sheep who trouble me. Still, I suppose </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">an escort might be in order.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="336" height="15" font="1">“I can spare a hundred gold cloaks,” Tyrion said. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="113" height="15" font="1">“Five hundred.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="123" height="15" font="1">“Three hundred.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And forty more—twenty knights with as many squires. If I arrive without a knightly </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="330" height="15" font="1">tail, the Tyrells will think me of small account.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="228" height="15" font="1">That was true enough. “Agreed.” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I’ll include Horror and Slobber in my party, and send them on to their lord father </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">afterward. A gesture of goodwill. We need Paxter Redwyne, he’s Mace Tyrell’s oldest friend, </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">and a great power in his own right.” </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And a traitor,” the queen said, balking. “The Arbor would have declared for Renly with </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="543" height="15" font="1">all the rest, except that Redwyne knew full well his whelps would suffer for it.” </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Renly is dead, Your Grace,” Littlefinger pointed out, “and neither Stannis nor Lord </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Paxter will have forgotten how Redwyne galleys closed the sea during the siege of Storm’s </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">End. Restore the twins and perchance we may win Redwyne’s love.” </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Cersei remained unconvinced. “The Others can keep his love, I want his swords and </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">sails. Holding tight to those twins is the best way to make certain that we’ll have them.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had the answer. “Then let us send Ser Hobber back to the Arbor and keep Ser </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Horas here. Lord Paxter ought to be clever enough to riddle out the meaning of that, I should </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The suggestion was carried without protest, but Littlefinger was not done. “We’ll want </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shifted uncomfortably. “Done. Will that be all? I remind you, there’s a long road </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">between here and Bitterbridge.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’ll be riding it before dawn breaks.” Littlefinger rose. “I trust that on my return, the </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="527" height="15" font="1">king will see that I am suitably rewarded for my valiant efforts in his cause?” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Varys giggled. “Joffrey is such a grateful sovereign, I’m certain you will have no cause </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="238" height="15" font="1">to complain, my good brave lord.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">The queen was more direct. “What do you want, Petyr?” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Littlefinger glanced at Tyrion with a sly smile. “I shall need to give that some </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">consideration. No doubt I’ll think of something.” He sketched an airy bow and took his leave, </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="331" height="15" font="1">as casual as if he were off to one of his brothels. </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion glanced out the window. The fog was so thick that he could not even see the </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">curtain wall across the yard. A few dim lights shone indistinct through that greyness. <i>A foul </i></text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>day for travel</i>, he thought. He did not envy Petyr Baelish. “We had best see to drawing up </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">those documents. Lord Varys, send for parchment and quill. And someone will need to wake </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was still grey and dark when the meeting finally ended. Varys scurried off alone, his </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">soft slippers whisking along the floor. The Lannisters lingered a moment by the door. “How </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">comes your chain, brother?” the queen asked as Ser Preston fastened a vair-lined cloth-of-</text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">silver cloak about her shoulders. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Link by link, it grows longer. We should thank the gods that Ser Cortnay Penrose is as </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">stubborn as he is. Stannis will never march north with Storm’s End untaken in his rear.” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tyrion, I know we do not always agree on policy, but it seems to me that I was wrong </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">about you. You are not so big a fool as I imagined. In truth, I realize now that you have been a </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">great help. For that I thank you. You must forgive me if I have spoken to you harshly in the </text>

<text top="834" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Must I?” He gave her a shrug, a smile. “Sweet sister, you have said nothing that requires </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">forgiveness.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Today, you mean?” They both laughed . . . and Cersei leaned over and planted a quick, </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="149" height="15" font="1">soft kiss on his brow. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Too astonished for words, Tyrion could only watch her stride off down the hall, Ser </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Preston at her side. “Have I lost my wits, or did my sister just kiss me?” he asked Bronn when </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="1">she was gone. </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="133" height="15" font="1">“Was it so sweet?” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“It was . . . unanticipated.” Cersei had been behaving queerly of late. Tyrion found it very </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">unsettling. “I am trying to recall the last time she kissed me. I could not have been more than </text>

<text top="313" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Aeron Damphair’s voice cut through the insults like a sword through cheese. “Now you </text>

<text top="358" left="171" width="303" height="15" font="1">“I have questions for him first,” said Theon. </text>
<text top="383" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Fuck</i> your questions.” Benfred hung bleeding and helpless between Stygg and Werlag. </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">“You’ll choke on them before you get any answers from me, craven. Turncloak.” </text>
<text top="428" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Uncle Aeron was relentless. “When he spits on you, he spits on all of us. He spits on the </text>

<text top="522" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>And to watch me.</i> Theon dare not push matters too far with his uncle. The command was </text>
<text top="542" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his, yes, but his men had a faith in the Drowned God that they did not have in him, and they </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="428" height="15" font="1">were terrified of Aeron Damphair. <i>I cannot fault them for that.</i> </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You’ll lose your head for this, Greyjoy. The crows will eat the jelly of your eyes.” </text>
<text top="606" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Benfred tried to spit again, but only managed a little blood. “The Others bugger your wet </text>

<text top="650" left="171" width="560" height="15" font="5"><i>Tallhart, you’ve spit away your life</i>, Theon thought. “Stygg, silence him,” he said. </text>
<text top="676" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They forced Benfred to his knees. Werlag tore the rabbitskin off his belt and jammed it </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">between his teeth to stop his shouting. Stygg unlimbered his axe. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="536" height="15" font="1">“No,” Aeron Damphair declared. “He must be given to the god. The old way.” </text>

<text top="796" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That was more than Theon could stomach. “You are the priest, Uncle, I leave the god to </text>

<text top="835" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Stygg began to drag their captive off toward the shore. Aeron Damphair gave his nephew </text>

<text top="898" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Perhaps it’s a kindness</i>, Theon told himself as he stalked off in the other direction. Stygg </text>
<text top="918" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">was hardly the most expert of headsmen, and Benfred had a neck thick as a boar’s, heavy with </text>

<text top="957" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remembered. That had been, what, three years past? When Ned Stark had ridden to Torrhen’s </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Climbing a jumble of stone, Theon looked down on the dead men and dying horses. The </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">horses had deserved better. Tymor and his brothers had gathered up what mounts had come </text>

<text top="221" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see if they had any jewelry worth the taking, but the notion left a bitter taste in his mouth. He </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">could imagine what Eddard Stark would have said. Yet that thought made him angry too. </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="5"><i>Stark is dead and rotting, and naught to me</i>, he reminded himself. </text>
<text top="285" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Old Botley, who was called Fishwhiskers, sat scowling by his pile of plunder while his </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">three sons added to it. One of them was in a shoving match with a fat man named Todric, who </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was reeling among the slain with a horn of ale in one hand and an axe in the other, clad in a </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cloak of white fox-fur only slightly stained by the blood of its previous owner. <i>Drunk</i>, Theon </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">decided, watching him bellow. It was said that the ironmen of old had oft been blood-drunk in </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="624" height="15" font="1">battle, so berserk that they felt no pain and feared no foe, but this was a common ale-drunk. </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Wex, my bow and quiver.” The boy ran and fetched them. Theon bent the bow and </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slipped the string into its notches as Todric knocked down the Botley boy and flung ale into </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his eyes. Fishwhiskers leapt up cursing, but Theon was quicker. He drew on the hand that </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">clutched the drinking horn, figuring to give them a shot to talk about, but Todric spoiled it by </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="522" height="15" font="1">lurching to one side just as he loosed. The arrow took him through the belly. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The looters stopped to gape. Theon lowered his bow. “No drunkards, I said, and no </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">squabbles over plunder.” On his knees, Todric was dying noisily. “Botley, silence him.” </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Fishwhiskers and his sons were quick to obey. They slit Todric’s throat as he kicked feebly, </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">and were stripping him of cloak and rings and weapons before he was even dead. </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Now they know I mean what I say.</i> Lord Balon might have given him the command, but </text>

<text top="652" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">banner, clutched in the dead hand of the squire who’d borne it. A rabbitskin had been tied </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">below the flag. <i>Why rabbitskins?</i> he had meant to ask, but being spat on had made him forget </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his questions. He tossed his bow back to Wex and strode off, remembering how elated he’d </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">felt after the Whispering Wood, and wondering why this did not taste as sweet. <i>Tallhart, you </i></text>

<text top="394" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">hideous sight. Under a snowy-white mane of hair, Dagmer Cleftjaw had the most gut-</text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">churning scar Theon had ever seen, the legacy of the longaxe that had near killed him as a </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">boy. The blow had splintered his jaw, shattered his front teeth, and left him four lips where </text>

<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grow over the scar, so a shiny seam of puckered, twisted flesh divided his face like a crevasse </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through a snowfield. “We could hear them singing,” the old warrior said. “It was a good song, </text>

<text top="580" left="171" width="189" height="15" font="1">“How many men are lost?” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Of ours?” Theon shrugged. “Todric. I killed him for getting drunk and fighting over </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">loot.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Some men are born to be killed.” A lesser man might have been afraid to show a smile </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as frightening as his, yet Dagmer grinned more often and more broadly than Lord Balon ever </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="33" height="15" font="1">had. </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ugly as it was, that smile brought back a hundred memories. Theon had seen it often as a </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">boy, when he’d jumped a horse over a mossy wall, or flung an axe and split a target square. </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He’d seen it when he blocked a blow from Dagmer’s sword, when he put an arrow through a </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seagull on the wing, when he took the tiller in hand and guided a longship safely through a </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">snarl of foaming rocks. <i>He gave me more smiles than my father and Eddard Stark together.</i> </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Even Robb . . . he ought to have won a smile the day he’d saved Bran from that wildling, but </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="541" height="15" font="1">instead he’d gotten a scolding, as if he were some cook who’d burned the stew. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You and I must talk, Uncle,” Theon said. Dagmer was no true uncle, only a sworn man </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with perhaps a pinch of Greyjoy blood four or five lives back, and that from the wrong side of </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">the blanket. Yet Theon had always called him uncle nonetheless. </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Come onto my deck, then.” There were no <i>m’lords</i> from Dagmer, not when he stood on </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">his own deck. On the Iron Islands, every captain was a king aboard his own ship. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He climbed the plank to the deck of the <i>Foamdrinker</i> in four long strides, and Dagmer </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">led him back to the cramped aft cabin, where the old man poured a horn of sour ale and </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">offered Theon the same. He declined. “We did not capture enough horses. A few, </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">but . . . well, I’ll make do with what I have, I suppose. Fewer men means more glory.” </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What need do we have of horses?” Like most ironmen, Dagmer preferred to fight on </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">foot or from the deck of a ship. “Horses will only shit on our decks and get in our way.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“If we sailed, yes,” Theon admitted. “I have another plan.” He watched the other </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">carefully to see how he would take that. Without the Cleftjaw he could not hope to succeed. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Command or no, the men would never follow him if both Aeron and Dagmer opposed him, </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="395" height="15" font="1">and he had no hope of winning over the sour-faced priest. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Your lord father commanded us to harry the coast, no more.” Eyes pale as sea foam </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watched Theon from under those shaggy white eyebrows. Was it disapproval he saw there, or </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">a spark of interest? The latter, he thought . . . hoped . . . </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="193" height="15" font="1">“You are my father’s man.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“His <i>best</i> man, and always have been.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Pride</i>, Theon thought. <i>He is proud, I must use that, his pride will be the key.</i> “There is no </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">man in the Iron Islands half so skilled with spear or sword.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You have been too long away, boy. When you left, it was as you say, but I am grown </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">old in Lord Greyjoy’s service. The singers call Andrik best now. Andrik the Unsmiling, they </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">name him. A giant of a man. He serves Lord Drumm of Old Wyk. And Black Lorren and Qarl </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">the Maid are near as dread.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="542" height="15" font="1">“This Andrik may be a great fighter, but men do not fear him as they fear you.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aye, that’s so,” Dagmer said. The fingers curled around the drinking horn were heavy </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">with rings, gold and silver and bronze, set with chunks of sapphire and garnet and </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">dragonglass. He had paid the iron price for every one, Theon knew. </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If I had a man like you in my service, I should not waste him on this child’s business of </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">harrying and burning. This is no work for Lord Balon’s best man . . .” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Dagmer’s grin twisted his lips apart and showed the brown splinters of his teeth. “Nor for </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his trueborn son?” He hooted. “I know you too well, Theon. I saw you take your first step, </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="436" height="15" font="1">helped you bend your first bow. ‘Tis not me who feels wasted.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“By rights I should have my sister’s command,” he admitted, uncomfortably aware of </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">how peevish that sounded. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You take this business too hard, boy. It is only that your lord father does not know you. </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">With your brothers dead and you taken by the wolves, your sister was his solace. He learned </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="309" height="15" font="1">to rely on her, and she has never failed him.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Nor have I. The Starks knew my worth. I was one of Brynden Blackfish’s picked scouts, </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and I charged with the first wave in the Whispering Wood. I was <i>that</i> close to crossing swords </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with the Kingslayer himself.” Theon held his hands two feet apart. “Daryn Hornwood came </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="196" height="15" font="1">between us, and died for it.” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Why do you tell me this?” Dagmer asked. “It was me who put your first sword in your </text>

<text top="865" left="171" width="131" height="15" font="1">“Does my father?” </text>

<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am no Stark.” <i>Lord Eddard saw to that.</i> “I am a Greyjoy, and I mean to be my father’s </text>

<text top="1024" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Let my uncle Aeron see to it. I’ll give him six ships, all but <i>Foamdrinker</i> and <i>Sea Bitch</i>, </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="331" height="15" font="1">and he can burn and drown to his god’s surfeit.” </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">Dagmer took a long draught from his horn. “Tell me.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>He is tempted</i>, Theon thought. <i>He likes this reaver’s work no better than I do.</i> “If my </text>

<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon allowed himself a sly smile. “But we have four times the wits, and five times the </text>

<text top="313" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“—will thank me, when I hand him his kingdom. I mean to do a deed that the harpers </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">will sing of for a thousand years.” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He knew that would give Dagmer pause. A singer had made a song about the axe that </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cracked his jaw in half, and the old man loved to hear it. Whenever he was in his cups he </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would call for a reaving song, something loud and stormy that told of dead heroes and deeds </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">of wild valor. <i>His hair is white and his teeth are rotten, but he still has a taste for glory.</i> </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What would my part be in this scheme of yours, boy?” Dagmer Cleftjaw asked after a </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="294" height="15" font="1">long silence, and Theon knew he had won. </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“To strike terror into the heart of the foe, as only one of your name could do. You’ll take </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the great part of our force and march on Torrhen’s Square. Helman Tallhart took his best men </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">south, and Benfred died here with their sons. His uncle Leobald will remain, with some small </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">garrison.”  <i>If I had been able to question Benfred, I would know just how small.</i> “Make no </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="1">secret of your approach. Sing all the brave songs you like. I want them to close their gates.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="285" height="15" font="1">“Is this Torrhen’s Square a strong keep?” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Strong enough. The walls are stone, thirty feet high, with square towers at each corner </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">and a square keep within.” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Stone walls cannot be fired. How are we to take them? We do not have the numbers to </text>

<text top="703" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“You will make camp outside their walls and set to building catapults and siege engines.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That is not the Old Way. Have you forgotten? Ironmen fight with swords and axes, not </text>

<text top="773" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Leobald will not know that. When he sees you raising siege towers, his old woman’s </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood will run cold, and he will bleat for help. Stay your archers, Uncle, and let the raven fly. </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The castellan at Winterfell is a brave man, but age has stiffened his wits as well as his limbs. </text>

<text top="895" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Any force he summons will be larger than mine,” Dagmer said, “and these old knights </text>

<text top="934" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">You set us a battle we cannot hope to win, Theon. This Torrhen’s Square will never fall.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Confusion and clangor ruled the castle. Men stood on the beds of wagons loading casks </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of wine, sacks of flour, and bundles of new-fletched arrows. Smiths straightened swords, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knocked dents from breastplates, and shoed destriers and pack mules alike. Mail shirts were </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tossed in barrels of sand and rolled across the lumpy surface of the Flowstone Yard to scour </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them clean. Weese’s women had twenty cloaks to mend, a hundred more to wash. The high </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and humble crowded into the sept together to pray. Outside the walls, tents and pavilions were </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">coming down. Squires tossed pails of water over cookfires, while soldiers took out their </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">oilstones to give their blades one last good lick. The noise was a swelling tide: horses blowing </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">and whickering, lords shouting commands, men-at-arms trading curses, camp followers </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">squabbling. </text>
<text top="304" left="171" width="301" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin Lannister was marching at last. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Addam Marbrand was the first of the captains to depart, a day before the rest. He </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">made a gallant show of it, riding a spirited red courser whose mane was the same copper color </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">as the long hair that streamed past Ser Addam’s shoulders. The horse was barded in bronze-</text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">colored trappings dyed to match the rider’s cloak and emblazoned with the burning tree. Some </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the castle women sobbed to see him go. Weese said he was a great horseman and sword </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">fighter, Lord Tywin’s most daring commander. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I hope he dies</i>, Arya thought as she watched him ride out the gate, his men streaming </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">after him in a double column. <i>I hope they all die.</i> They were going to fight Robb, she knew. </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Listening to the talk as she went about her work, Arya had learned that Robb had won some </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">great victory in the west. He’d burned Lannisport, some said, or else he meant to burn it. He’d </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">captured Casterly Rock and put everyone to the sword, or he was besieging the Golden </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="429" height="15" font="1">Tooth . . . but <i>something</i> had happened, that much was certain. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Weese had her running messages from dawn to dusk. Some of them even took her </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beyond the castle walls, out into the mud and madness of the camp. <i>I could flee</i>, she thought </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as a wagon rumbled past her. <i>I could hop on the back of a wagon and hide, or fall in with the </i></text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>camp followers, no one would stop me.</i> She might have done it if not for Weese. He’d told </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them more than once what he’d do to anyone who tried to run off on him. “It won’t be no </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beating, oh, no. I won’t lay a finger on you. I’ll just save you for the Qohorik, yes I will, I’ll </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">save you for the Crippler. Vargo Hoat his name is, and when he gets back he’ll cut off your </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">feet.” <i>Maybe if Weese were dead</i>, Arya thought . . . but not when she was with him. He could </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="1">look at you and smell what you were thinking, he always said so. </text>
<text top="755" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Weese never imagined she could read, though, so he never bothered to seal the messages </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he gave her. Arya peeked at them all, but they were never anything good, just stupid stuff </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sending this cart to the granary and that one to the armory. One was a demand for payment on </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a gambling debt, but the knight she gave it to couldn’t read. When she told him what it said he </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tried to hit her, but Arya ducked under the blow, snatched a silver-banded drinking horn off </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his saddle, and darted away. The knight roared and came after her, but she slid between two </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wayns, wove through a crowd of archers, and jumped a latrine trench. In his mail he couldn’t </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">keep up. When she gave the horn to Weese, he told her that a smart little Weasel like her </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deserved a reward. “I’ve got my eye on a plump crisp capon to sup on tonight. We’ll share it, </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">me and you. You’ll like that.” </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Everywhere she went, Arya searched for Jaqen H’ghar, wanting to whisper another name </text>
<text top="975" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">to him before those she hated were all gone out of her reach, but amidst the chaos and </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">confusion the Lorathi sellsword was not to be found. He still owed her two deaths, and she </text>
<text top="1014" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was worried she would never get them if he rode off to battle with the rest. Finally she worked </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">up the courage to ask one of the gate guards if he’d gone. “One of Lorch’s men, is he?” the </text>
<text top="1053" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man said. “He won’t be going, then. His lordship’s named Ser Amory castellan of Harrenhal. </text>
<text top="1073" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">That whole lot’s staying right here, to hold the castle. The Bloody Mummers will be left as </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">well, to do the foraging. That goat Vargo Hoat is like to spit, him and Lorch have always </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">hated each other.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Mountain would be leaving with Lord Tywin, though. He would command the van </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in battle, which meant that Dunsen, Polliver, and Raff would all slip between her fingers </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="1">unless she could find Jaqen and have him kill one of them before they left. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Weasel,” Weese said that afternoon. “Get to the armory and tell Lucan that Ser Lyonel </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">notched his sword in practice and needs a new one. Here’s his mark.” He handed her a square </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">of paper. “Be quick about it now, he’s to ride with Ser Kevan Lannister.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya took the paper and ran. The armory adjoined the castle smithy, a long high-roofed </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tunnel of a building with twenty forges built into its walls and long stone water troughs for </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tempering the steel. Half of the forges were at work when she entered. The walls rang with the </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sound of hammers, and burly men in leather aprons stood sweating in the sullen heat as they </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bent over bellows and anvils. When she spied Gendry, his bare chest was slick with sweat, but </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the blue eyes under the heavy black hair had the stubborn look she remembered. Arya didn’t </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">know that she even wanted to talk to him. It was his fault they’d all been caught. “Which one </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">is Lucan?” She thrust out the paper. “I’m to get a new sword for Ser Lyonel.” </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Never mind about Ser Lyonel.” He drew her aside by the arm. “Last night Hot Pie asked </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">me if I heard you yell <i>Winterfell</i> back at the holdfast, when we were all fighting on the wall.” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="98" height="15" font="1">“I never did!” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="217" height="15" font="1">“Yes you did. I heard you too.” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Everyone was yelling stuff,” Arya said defensively. “Hot Pie yelled <i>hot pie</i>. He must </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="220" height="15" font="1">have yelled it a hundred times.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s what <i>you</i> yelled that matters. I told Hot Pie he should clean the wax out of his ears, </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="512" height="15" font="1">that all you yelled was <i>Go to hell!</i> If he asks you, you better say the same.” </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I will,” she said, even though she thought <i>go to hell</i> was a stupid thing to yell. She </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="610" height="15" font="1">didn’t dare tell Hot Pie who she really was. <i>Maybe I should say Hot Pie’s name to Jaqen.</i> </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“I’ll get Lucan,” Gendry said. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lucan grunted at the writing (though Arya did not think he could read it), and pulled </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down a heavy longsword. “This is too good for that oaf, and you tell him I said so,” he said as </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="152" height="15" font="1">he gave her the blade. </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I will,” she lied. If she did any such thing, Weese would beat her bloody. Lucan could </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">deliver his own insults. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The longsword was a lot heavier than Needle had been, but Arya liked the feel of it. The </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">weight of steel in her hands made her feel stronger. <i>Maybe I’m not a water dancer yet, but I’m </i></text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>not a mouse either. A mouse couldn’t use a sword but I can.</i> The gates were open, soldiers </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">coming and going, drays rolling in empty and going out creaking and swaying under their </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">loads. She thought about going to the stables and telling them that Ser Lyonel wanted a new </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horse. She had the paper, the stableboys wouldn’t be able to read it any better than Lucan had. </text>
<text top="918" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>I could take the horse and the sword and just ride out. If the guards tried to stop me I’d show </i></text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>them the paper and say I was bringing everything to Ser Lyonel.</i> She had no notion what Ser </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lyonel looked like or where to find him, though. If they questioned her, they’d know, and </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">then Weese . . . Weese . . . </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">As she chewed her lip, trying not to think about how it would feel to have her feet cut off, </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a group of archers in leather jerkins and iron helms went past, their bows slung across their </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="302" height="15" font="1">shoulders. Arya heard snatches of their talk. </text>

<page number="293" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“. . . <i>giants</i> I tell you, he’s got giants twenty foot tall come down from beyond the Wall, </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“. . . shit on your wolves and giants, the boy’d piss his pants if he knew we was coming. </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He wasn’t man enough to march on Harrenhal, was he? Ran t’other way, didn’t he? He’d run </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Yes</i>, Arya thought. <i>Yes, it’s you who ought to run, you and Lord Tywin and the Mountain </i></text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>and Ser Addam and Ser Amory and stupid Ser Lyonel whoever he is, all of you better run or </i></text>

<text top="366" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Weasel.” Weese’s voice cracked like a whip. She never saw where he came from, but </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">suddenly he was right in front of her. “Give me that. Took you long enough.” He snatched the </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sword from her fingers, and dealt her a stinging slap with the back of his hand. “Next time be </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="122" height="15" font="1">quicker about it.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">For a moment she had been a wolf again, but Weese’s slap took it all away and left her </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with nothing but the taste of her own blood in her mouth. She’d bitten her tongue when he hit </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">her. She hated him for that. </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“You want another?” Weese demanded. “You’ll get it too. I’ll have none of your insolent </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">looks. Get down to the brewhouse and tell Tuffleberry that I have two dozen barrels for him, </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but he better send his lads to fetch them or I’ll find someone wants ‘em worse.” Arya started </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">off, but not quick enough for Weese. “You <i>run</i> if you want to eat tonight,” he shouted, his </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">promises of a plump crisp capon already forgotten. “And don’t be getting lost again, or I </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="1">swear I’ll beat you bloody.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>You won’t</i>, Arya thought. <i>You won’t ever again.</i> But she ran. The old gods of the north </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">must have been guiding her steps. Halfway to the brewhouse, as she passing under the stone </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">bridge that arched between Widow’s Tower and Kingspyre, she heard harsh, growling </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">laughter. Rorge came around a corner with three other men, the manticore badge of Ser </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Amory sewn over their hearts. When he saw her, he stopped and grinned, showing a mouthful </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of crooked brown teeth under the leather flap he wore sometimes to cover the hole in his face. </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Yoren’s little cunt,” he called her. “Guess we know why that black bastard wanted <i>you</i> on </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Wall, don’t we?” He laughed again, and the others laughed with him. “Where’s your stick </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">now?” Rorge demanded suddenly, the smile gone as quick as it had come. “Seems to me I </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">promised to fuck you with it.” He took a step toward her. Arya edged backward. “Not so </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="298" height="15" font="1">brave now that I’m not in chains, are you?” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I <i>saved</i> you.” She kept a good yard between them, ready to run quick as a snake if he </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">made a grab for her. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Owe you another fucking for that, seems like. Did Yoren pump your cunny, or did he </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">like that tight little ass better?” </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="382" height="15" font="1">“I’m looking for Jaqen,” she said. “There’s a message.” </text>
<text top="970" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Rorge halted. Something in his eyes . . . could it be that he was <i>scared</i> of Jaqen H’ghar? </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">“The bathhouse. Get out of my way.” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya whirled and ran, swift as a deer, her feet flying over the cobbles all the way to the </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bathhouse. She found Jaqen soaking in a tub, steam rising around him as a serving girl sluiced </text>
</page>
<page number="294" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hot water over his head. His long hair, red on one side and white on the other, fell down </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="250" height="15" font="1">across his shoulders, wet and heavy. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She crept up quiet as a shadow, but he opened his eyes all the same. “She steals in on </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">little mice feet, but a man hears,” he said. <i>How could he hear me?</i> she wondered, and it </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seemed as if he heard that as well. “The scuff of leather on stone sings loud as warhorns to a </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="318" height="15" font="1">man with open ears. Clever girls go barefoot.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have a message.” Arya eyed the serving girl uncertainly. When she did not seem likely </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">to go away, she leaned in until her mouth was almost touching his ear. “Weese,” she </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">whispered. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jaqen H’ghar closed his eyes again, floating languid, half-asleep. “Tell his lordship a </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man shall attend him at his leisure.” His hand moved suddenly, splashing hot water at her, and </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">Arya had to leap back to keep from getting drenched. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When she told Tuffleberry what Weese had said, the brewer cursed loudly. “You tell </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Weese my lads got duties to attend to, and you tell him he’s a pox-ridden bastard too, and the </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">seven hells will freeze over before he gets another horn of my ale. I’ll have them barrels </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="424" height="15" font="1">within the hour or Lord Tywin will hear of it, see if he don’t.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Weese cursed too when Arya brought back that message, even though she left out the </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pox-ridden bastard part. He fumed and threatened, but in the end he rounded up six men and </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="465" height="15" font="1">sent them off grumbling to fetch the barrels down to the brewhouse. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Supper that evening was a thin stew of barley, onion, and carrots, with a wedge of stale </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brown bread. One of the women had taken to sleeping in Weese’s bed, and she got a piece of </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ripe blue cheese as well, and a wing off the capon that Weese had spoken of that morning. He </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ate the rest himself, the grease running down in a shiny line through the boils that festered at </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the corner of his mouth. The bird was almost gone when he glanced up from his trencher and </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">saw Arya staring. “Weasel, come here.” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">A few mouthfuls of dark meat still clung to one thigh. <i>He forgot, but now he’s </i></text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>remembered</i>, Arya thought. It made her feel bad for telling Jaqen to kill him. She got off the </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">bench and went to the head of the table. </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I saw you looking at me.” Weese wiped his fingers on the front of her shift. Then he </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grabbed her throat with one hand and slapped her with the other. “What did I tell you?” He </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slapped her again, backhand. “Keep those eyes to yourself, or next time I’ll spoon one out and </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">feed it to my bitch.” A shove sent her stumbling to the floor. Her hem caught on a loose nail </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in the splintered wooden bench and ripped as she fell. “You’ll mend that before you sleep,” </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Weese announced as he pulled the last bit of meat off the capon. When he was finished he </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">sucked his fingers noisily, and threw the bones to his ugly spotted dog. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Weese,” Arya whispered that night as she bent over the tear in her shift. “Dunsen, </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Polliver, Raff the Sweetling,” she said, calling a name every time she pushed the bone needle </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through the undyed wool. “The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei.” She wondered how much longer she would have to </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">include Weese in her prayer, and drifted off to sleep dreaming that on the morrow, when she </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">woke, he’d be dead. </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But it was the sharp toe of Weese’s boot that woke her, as ever. The main strength of </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin’s host would ride this day, he told them as they broke their fast on oatcakes. </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Don’t none of you be thinking how easy it’ll be here once m’lord of Lannister is gone,” he </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">warned. “The castle won’t grow no smaller, I promise you that, only now there’ll be fewer </text>

<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">golden lion. Behind the Lannisters came their great lords and captains. Their banners flared </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and flapped, a pageant of color: red ox and golden mountain, purple unicorn and bantam </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rooster, brindled boar and badger, a silver ferret and a juggler in motley, stars and sunbursts, </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">peacock and panther, chevron and dagger, black hood and blue beetle and green arrow. </text>

<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tempered as his rider. Polliver rode beside him, with the black dog standard in his hand and </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">Gendry’s horned helm on his head. He was a tall man, but he looked no more than a half-</text>

<text top="413" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A shiver crept up Arya’s spine as she watched them pass under the great iron portcullis </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of Harrenhal. Suddenly she knew that she had made a terrible mistake. <i>I’m so stupid</i>, she </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">thought. Weese did not matter, no more than Chiswyck had. <i>These</i> were the men who </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mattered, the ones she ought to have killed. Last night she could have whispered any of them </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">dead, if only she hadn’t been so mad at Weese for hitting her and lying about the capon. <i>Lord </i></text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="254" height="15" font="5"><i>Tywin, why didn’t I say Lord Tywin?</i> </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Perhaps it was not too late to change her mind. Weese was not killed yet. If she could </text>

<text top="580" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hurriedly, Arya ran down the twisting steps, her chores forgotten. She heard the rattle of </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chains as the portcullis was slowly lowered, its spikes sinking deep into the ground . . . and </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">then another sound, a shriek of pain and fear. </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">A dozen people got there before her, though none was coming any too close. Arya </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">squirmed between them. Weese was sprawled across the cobbles, his throat a red ruin, eyes </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gaping sightlessly up at a bank of grey cloud. His ugly spotted dog stood on his chest, lapping </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">at the blood pulsing from his neck, and every so often ripping a mouthful of flesh out of the </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">dead man’s face. </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Finally someone brought a crossbow and shot the spotted dog dead while she was </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">worrying at one of Weese’s ears. </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="591" height="15" font="1">“Damnedest thing,” she heard a man say. “He had that bitch dog since she was a pup.” </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">“This place is cursed,” the man with the crossbow said. </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“It’s Harren’s ghost, that’s what it is,” said Goodwife Amabel. “I’ll not sleep here </text>

<text top="887" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya lifted her gaze from the dead man and his dead dog. Jaqen H’ghar was leaning up </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“I see.” She had met Rivers at the Twins; a baseborn son of Lord Walder Frey, half-</text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">brother to Ser Perwyn. It did not surprise her to learn that Robb had struck at the heart of </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="275" height="15" font="1">“His camp is two hours’ ride, my lady.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Take us to him,” she commanded. Brienne helped her back into her saddle, and they set </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">out at once. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="432" height="15" font="1">“Have you come from Bitterbridge, my lady?” the scout asked. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No.” She had not dared. With Renly dead, Catelyn had been uncertain of the reception </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she might receive from his young widow and her protectors. Instead she had ridden through </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the heart of the war, through fertile riverlands turned to blackened desert by the fury of the </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lannisters, and each night her scouts brought back tales that made her ill. “Lord Renly is </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="124" height="15" font="1">slain,” she added. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">“We’d hoped that tale was some Lannister lie, or—” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="398" height="15" font="1">“Would that it were. My brother commands in Riverrun?” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="544" height="15" font="1">“Yes, my lady. His Grace left Ser Edmure to hold Riverrun and guard his rear.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods grant him the strength to do so</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>And the wisdom as well.</i> “Is there </text>

<text top="550" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You have not heard?” The man seemed surprised. “His Grace won a great victory at </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="1">Oxcross. Ser Stafford Lannister is dead, his host scattered.” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Wendel Manderly gave a <i>whoop</i> of pleasure, but Catelyn only nodded. Tomorrow’s </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">trials concerned her more than yesterday’s triumphs. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Martyn Rivers had made his camp in the shell of a shattered holdfast, beside a roofless </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stable and a hundred fresh graves. He went to one knee when Catelyn dismounted. “Well met, </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">my lady. Your brother charged us to keep an eye out for your party, and escort you back to </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="336" height="15" font="1">Riverrun in all haste should we come upon you.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">Catelyn scarce liked the sound of that. “Is it my father?” </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“No, my lady. Lord Hoster is unchanged.” Rivers was a ruddy man with scant </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">resemblance to his half-brothers. “It is only that we feared you might chance upon Lannister </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="524" height="15" font="1">scouts. Lord Tywin has left Harrenhal and marches west with all his power.” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Rise,” she told Rivers, frowning. Stannis Baratheon would soon be on the march as </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">well, gods help them all. “How long until Lord Tywin is upon us?” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Three days, perhaps four, it is hard to know. We have eyes out along all the roads, but it </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">would be best not to linger.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Nor did they. Rivers broke his camp quickly and saddled up beside her, and they set off </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">again, near fifty strong now, flying beneath the direwolf, the leaping trout, the twin towers. </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her men wanted to hear more of Robb’s victory at Oxcross, and Rivers obliged. “There’s </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a singer come to Riverrun, calls himself Rymund the Rhymer, he’s made a song of the fight. </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Doubtless you’ll hear it sung tonight, my lady. ‘Wolf in the Night’ this Rymund calls it.” He </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">went on to tell how the remnants of Ser Stafford’s host had fallen back on Lannisport. </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Without siege engines there was no way to storm Casterly Rock, so the Young Wolf was </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mines at Castamere, Nunn’s Deep, and the Pendric Hills. Ser Wendel laughed. “Nothing’s </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">more like to bring a Lannister running than a threat to his gold.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“How did the king ever take the Tooth?” Ser Perwyn Frey asked his bastard brother. </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">“That’s a hard strong keep, and it commands the hill road.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He never took it. He slipped around it in the night. It’s said the direwolf showed him the </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">way, that Grey Wind of his. The beast sniffed out a goat track that wound down a defile and </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">up along beneath a ridge, a crooked and stony way, yet wide enough for men riding single-</text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">file. The Lannisters in their watchtowers got not so much a glimpse of them.” Rivers lowered </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his voice. “There’s some say that after the battle, the king cut out Stafford Lannister’s heart </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="158" height="15" font="1">and fed it to the wolf.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="534" height="15" font="1">“I would not believe such tales,” Catelyn said sharply. “My son is no savage.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As you say, my lady. Still, it’s no more than the beast deserved. That is no common </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wolf, that one. The Greatjon’s been heard to say that the old gods of the north sent those </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">direwolves to your children.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Catelyn remembered the day when her boys had found the pups in the late summer </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">snows. There had been five, three male and two female for the five trueborn children of </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">House Stark . . . and a sixth, white of fur and red of eye, for Ned’s bastard son Jon Snow. <i>No </i></text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="5"><i>common wolves</i>, she thought. <i>No indeed.</i> </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That night as they made their camp, Brienne sought out her tent. “My lady, you are safely </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="613" height="15" font="1">back among your own now, a day’s ride from your brother’s castle. Give me leave to go.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Catelyn should not have been surprised. The homely young woman had kept to herself all </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through their journey, spending most of her time with the horses, brushing out their coats and </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pulling stones from their shoes. She had helped Shadd cook and clean game as well, and soon </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">proved that she could hunt as well as any. Any task Catelyn asked her to turn her hand to, </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Brienne had performed deftly and without complaint, and when she was spoken to she </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">answered politely, but she never chattered, nor wept, nor laughed. She had ridden with them </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="591" height="15" font="1">every day and slept among them every night without ever truly becoming one of them. </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>It was the same when she was with Renly</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>At the feast, in the melee, </i></text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>even in Renly’s pavilion with her brothers of the Rainbow Guard. There are walls around this </i></text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="5"><i>one higher than Winterfell’s.</i> </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“If you left us, where would you go?” Catelyn asked her. </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="284" height="15" font="1">“Back,” Brienne said. “To Storm’s End.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="214" height="15" font="1">“Alone.” It was not a question. </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The broad face was a pool of still water, giving no hint of what might live in the depths </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">below. “Yes.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="192" height="15" font="1">“You mean to kill Stannis.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="477" height="15" font="1">Brienne closed her thick callused fingers around the hilt of her sword. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">The sword that had been his. “I swore a vow. Three times I swore. You heard me.” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I did,” Catelyn admitted. The girl had kept the rainbow cloak when she discarded the </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rest of her bloodstained clothing, she knew. Brienne’s own things had been left behind during </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their flight, and she had been forced to clothe herself in odd bits of Ser Wendel’s spare garb, </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">since no one else in their party had garments large enough to fit her. “Vows should be kept, I </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">agree, but Stannis has a great host around him, and his own guards sworn to keep him safe.” </text>
<text top="1057" left="171" width="587" height="15" font="1">“I am not afraid of his guards. I am as good as any of them. I should never have fled.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Is that what troubles you, that some fool might call you craven?” She sighed. “Renly’s </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">death was no fault of yours. You served him valiantly, but when you seek to follow him into </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the earth, you serve no one.” She stretched out a hand, to give what comfort a touch could </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="218" height="15" font="1">give. “I know how hard it is—” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">Brienne shook off her hand. “No one knows.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You’re wrong,” Catelyn said sharply. “Every morning, when I wake, I remember that </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ned is gone. I have no skill with swords, but that does not mean that I do not dream of riding </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">to King’s Landing and wrapping my hands around Cersei Lannister’s white throat and </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">squeezing until her face turns black.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Beauty raised her eyes, the only part of her that was truly beautiful. “If you dream </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">that, why would you seek to hold me back? Is it because of what Stannis said at the parley?” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Was it?</i> Catelyn glanced across the camp. Two men were walking sentry, spears in hand. </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“I was taught that good men must fight evil in this world, and Renly’s death was evil beyond </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all doubt. Yet I was also taught that the gods make kings, not the swords of men. If Stannis is </text>

<text top="762" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Brienne stared at the ground and shuffled her feet. “I do not know your son, my lady.” </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="403" height="15" font="1">She looked up. “I could serve you. If you would have me.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="230" height="15" font="1">Catelyn was startled. “Why me?” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The question seemed to trouble Brienne. “You helped me. In the pavilion . . . when they </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The tall girl knelt awkwardly, unsheathed Renly’s longsword, and laid it at her feet. </text>

<text top="374" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">force of archers and pikemen wearing the eagle badge of the Mallisters. When they saw </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Catelyn’s banners, they emerged from behind their sharpened stakes and sent a man over from </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the far bank to lead her party across. “Slow and careful like, milady,” he warned as he took </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the bridle of her horse. “We’ve planted iron spikes under the water, y’see, and there’s caltrops </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">scattered among them rocks there. It’s the same on all the fords, by your brother’s command.” </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Edmure thinks to fight here.</i> The realization gave her a queasy feeling in the bowels, but </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">she held her tongue. </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Between the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, they joined a stream of smallfolk making </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for the safety of Riverrun. Some were driving animals before them, others pulling wayns, but </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they made way as Catelyn rode past, and cheered her with cries of “Tully!” or “Stark!” Half a </text>

<text top="644" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Catelyn spied a second camp strung out along the bank north of the Tumblestone, </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">familiar standards flapping in the wind—Marq Piper’s dancing maiden, Darry’s plowman, the </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">twining red-and-white snakes of the Paeges. They were all her father’s bannermen, lords of </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Trident. Most had left Riverrun before she had, to defend their own lands. If they were </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">here again, it could only mean that Edmure had called them back. <i>Gods save us, it’s true, he </i></text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="5"><i>means to offer battle to Lord Tywin.</i> </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Something dark was dangling against the walls of Riverrun, Catelyn saw from a distance. </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">When she rode close, she saw dead men hanging from the battlements, slumped at the ends of </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">long ropes with hempen nooses tight around their necks, their faces swollen and black. The </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crows had been at them, but their crimson cloaks still showed bright against the sandstone </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">walls. </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="414" height="15" font="1">“They have hanged some Lannisters,” Hal Mollen observed. </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">“A pretty sight,” Ser Wendel Manderly said cheerfully. </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Our friends have begun without us,” Perwyn Frey jested. The others laughed, all but </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">Brienne, who gazed up at the row of bodies unblinking, and neither spoke nor smiled. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>If they have slain the Kingslayer, then my daughters are dead as well.</i> Catelyn spurred </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her horse to a canter. Hal Mollen and Robin Flint raced past at a gallop, hallooing to the </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gatehouse. The guards on the walls had doubtless spied her banners some time ago, for the </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">portcullis was up as they approached. </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Edmure rode out from the castle to meet her, surrounded by three of her father’s sworn </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">men—great-bellied Ser Desmond Grell the master-at-arms, Utherydes Wayn the steward, and </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ser Robin Ryger, Riverrun’s big bald captain of guards. They were all three of an age with </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">Lord Hoster, men who had spent their lives in her father’s service. <i>Old men</i>, Catelyn realized. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Edmure wore a blue-and-red cloak over a tunic embroidered with silver fish. From the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">look of him, he had not shaved since she rode south; his beard was a fiery bush. “Cat, it is </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">good to have you safely back. When we heard of Renly’s death, we feared for your life. And </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin is on the march as well.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">“So I am told. How fares our father?” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“One day he seems stronger, the next . . .” He shook his head. “He’s asked for you. I did </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="191" height="15" font="1">not know what to tell him.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I will go to him soon,” she vowed. “Has there been word from Storm’s End since Renly </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">died? Or from Bitterbridge?” No ravens came to men on the road, and Catelyn was anxious to </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">know what had happened behind her. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Nothing from Bitterbridge. From Storm’s End, three birds from the castellan, Ser </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Cortnay Penrose, all carrying the same plea. Stannis has him surrounded by land and sea. He </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">offers his allegiance to whatsoever king will break the siege. He fears for the boy, he says. </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">What boy would that be, do you know?” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“Edric Storm,” Brienne told them. “Robert’s bastard son.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Edmure looked at her curiously. “Stannis has sworn that the garrison might go free, </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">unharmed, provided they yield the castle within the fortnight and deliver the boy into his </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">hands, but Ser Cortnay will not consent.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He risks all for a baseborn boy whose blood is not even his own</i>, Catelyn thought. “Did </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="183" height="15" font="1">you send him an answer?” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Edmure shook his head. “Why, when we have neither help nor hope to offer? And </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="204" height="15" font="1">Stannis is no enemy of ours.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Robin Ryger spoke. “My lady, can you tell us the manner of Lord Renly’s death? </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">The tales we’ve heard have been queer.” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Cat,” her brother said, “some say <i>you</i> killed Renly. Others claim it was some southron </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">woman.” His glance lingered on Brienne. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My king was murdered,” the girl said quietly, “and not by Lady Catelyn. I swear it on </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">my sword, by the gods old and new.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“This is Brienne of Tarth, the daughter of Lord Selwyn the Evenstar, who served in </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Renly’s Rainbow Guard,” Catelyn told them. “Brienne, I am honored to acquaint you with my </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brother Ser Edmure Tully, heir to Riverrun. His steward Utherydes Wayn. Ser Robin Ryger </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">and Ser Desmond Grell.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Honored,” said Ser Desmond. The others echoed him. The girl flushed, embarrassed </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">even at this commonplace courtesy. If Edmure thought her a curious sort of lady, at least he </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">had the grace not to say so. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Brienne was with Renly when he was killed, as was I,” said Catelyn, “but we had no </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">part in his death.” She did not care to speak of the shadow, here in the open with men all </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">around, so she waved a hand at the bodies. “Who are these men you’ve hanged?” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Edmure glanced up uncomfortably. “They came with Ser Cleos when he brought the </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">queen’s answer to our peace offer.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">Catelyn was shocked. “You’ve killed <i>envoys?</i>” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“False envoys,” Edmure declared. “They pledged me their peace and surrendered their </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weapons, so I allowed them freedom of the castle, and for three nights they ate my meat and </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">drank my mead whilst I talked with Ser Cleos. On the fourth night, they tried to free the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Kingslayer.” He pointed up. “That big brute killed two guards with naught but those ham </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hands of his, caught them by the throats and smashed their skulls together while that skinny </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">lad beside him was opening Lannister’s cell with a bit of wire, gods curse him. The one on the </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">end was some sort of damned mummer. He used my own voice to command that the River </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gate be opened. The guardsmen swear to it, Enger and Delp and Long Lew, all three. If you </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ask me, the man sounded nothing like me, and yet the oafs were raising the portcullis all the </text>

<text top="265" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">This was the Imp’s work, Catelyn suspected; it stank of the same sort of cunning he had </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">displayed at the Eyrie. Once, she would have named Tyrion the least dangerous of the </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="479" height="15" font="1">Lannisters. Now she was not so certain. “How is it you caught them?” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="569" height="15" font="1">“Ah, as it happened, I was not in the castle. I’d crossed the Tumblestone to, ah . . .” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“You were whoring or wenching. Get on with the tale.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Edmure’s cheeks flamed as red as his beard. “It was the hour before dawn, and I was </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only then returning. When Long Lew saw my boat and recognized me, he finally thought to </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">wonder who was standing below barking commands, and raised a cry.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="264" height="15" font="1">“Tell me the Kingslayer was retaken.” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“Yes, though not easily. Jaime got hold of a sword, slew Poul Pernford and Ser </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Desmond’s squire Myles, and wounded Delp so badly that Maester Vyman fears he’ll soon </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">die as well. It was a bloody mess. At the sound of steel, some of the other red cloaks rushed to </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">join him, bare-hand or no. I hanged those beside the four who freed him, and threw the rest in </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the dungeons. Jaime too. We’ll have no more escapes from that one. He’s down in the dark </text>

<text top="592" left="171" width="134" height="15" font="1">“And Cleos Frey?” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He swears he knew naught of the plot. Who can say? The man is half Lannister, half </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="369" height="15" font="1">Frey, and all liar. I put him in Jaime’s old tower cell.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="202" height="15" font="1">“You say he brought terms?” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="511" height="15" font="1">“If you can call them that. You’ll like them no more than I did, I promise.” </text>

<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">matters later.” Catelyn trotted over the drawbridge, putting the grisly row of dead Lannisters </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">behind her. Her brother kept pace. As they rode out into the bustle of Riverrun’s upper bailey, </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a naked toddler ran in front of the horses. Catelyn jerked her reins hard to avoid him, glancing </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">about in dismay. Hundreds of smallfolk had been admitted to the castle, and allowed to erect </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">crude shelters against the walls. Their children were everywhere underfoot, and the yard </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="486" height="15" font="1">teemed with their cows, sheep, and chickens. “Who are all these folk?” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“My people,” Edmure answered. “They were afraid.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Only my sweet brother would crowd all these useless mouths into a castle that might </i></text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>soon be under siege.</i> Catelyn knew that Edmure had a soft heart; sometimes she thought his </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">head was even softer. She loved him for it, yet still . . . </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="235" height="15" font="1">“Can Robb be reached by raven?” </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He’s in the field, my lady,” Ser Desmond replied. “The bird would have no way to find </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">him.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Utherydes Wayn coughed. “Before he left us, the young king instructed us to send you on </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to the Twins upon your return, Lady Stark. He asks that you learn more of Lord Walder’s </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="421" height="15" font="1">daughters, to help him select his bride when the time comes.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We’ll provide you with fresh mounts and provisions,” her brother promised. “You’ll </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="1">want to refresh yourself before—” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I’ll want to stay,” Catelyn said, dismounting. She had no intention of leaving Riverrun </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and her dying father to pick Robb’s wife for him. <i>Robb wants me safe, I cannot fault him for </i></text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>that, but his pretext is growing threadbare.</i> “Boy,” she called, and an urchin from the stables </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">ran out to take the reins of her horse. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Edmure swung down from his saddle. He was a head taller than she was, but he would </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">always be her little brother. “Cat,” he said unhappily, “Lord Tywin is coming—” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He is making for the west, to defend his own lands. If we close our gates and shelter </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="371" height="15" font="1">behind the walls, we can watch him pass with safety.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This is Tully land,” Edmure declared. “If Tywin Lannister thinks to cross it unbloodied, </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="243" height="15" font="1">I mean to teach him a hard lesson.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>The same lesson you taught his son?</i> Her brother could be stubborn as river rock when </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">his pride was touched, but neither of them was likely to forget how Ser Jaime had cut </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Edmure’s host to bloody pieces the last time he had offered battle. “We have nothing to gain </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="563" height="15" font="1">and everything to lose by meeting Lord Tywin in the field,” Catelyn said tactfully. </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="369" height="15" font="1">“The yard is not the place to discuss my battle plans.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="241" height="15" font="1">“As you will. Where shall we go?” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her brother’s face darkened. For a moment she thought he was about to lose his temper </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">with her, but finally he snapped, “The godswood. If you will insist.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She followed him along a gallery to the godswood gate. Edmure’s anger had always been </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">a sulky, sullen thing. Catelyn was sorry she had wounded him, but the matter was too </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">important for her to concern herself with his pride. When they were alone beneath the trees, </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">Edmure turned to face her. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">“You do not have the strength to meet the Lannisters in the field,” she said bluntly. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“When all my strength is marshaled, I should have eight thousand foot and three </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">thousand horse,” Edmure said. </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="441" height="15" font="1">“Which means Lord Tywin will have near twice your numbers.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Robb’s won his battles against worse odds,” Edmure replied, “and I have a plan. You’ve </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">forgotten Roose Bolton. Lord Tywin defeated him on the Green Fork, but failed to pursue. </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">When Lord Tywin went to Harrenhal, Bolton took the ruby ford and the crossroads. He has </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ten thousand men. I’ve sent word to Helman Tallhart to join him with the garrison Robb left </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="1">at the Twins—” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Edmure, Robb left those men to <i>hold</i> the Twins and make certain Lord Walder keeps </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="101" height="15" font="1">faith with us.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He has,” Edmure said stubbornly. “The Freys fought bravely in the Whispering Wood, </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and old Ser Stevron died at Oxcross, we hear. Ser Ryman and Black Walder and the rest are </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with Robb in the west, Martyn has been of great service scouting, and Ser Perwyn helped see </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you safe to Renly. Gods be good, how much more can we ask of them? Robb’s betrothed to </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">one of Lord Walder’s daughters, and Roose Bolton wed another, I hear. And haven’t you </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">taken two of his grandsons to be fostered at Winterfell?” </text>
</page>
<page number="303" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A ward can easily become a hostage, if need be.” She had not known that Ser Stevron </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">was dead, nor of Bolton’s marriage. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If we’re two hostages to the good, all the more reason Lord Walder dare not play us </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">false. Bolton needs Frey’s men, and Ser Helman’s as well. I’ve commanded him to retake </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">“That’s like to be a bloody business.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes, but once the castle falls, Lord Tywin will have no safe retreat. My own levies will </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">defend the fords of Red Fork against his crossing. If he attacks across the river, he’ll end as </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Rhaegar did when he tried to cross the Trident. If he holds back, he’ll be caught between </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Riverrun and Harrenhal, and when Robb returns from the west we can finish him for good and </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="33" height="15" font="1">all.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her brother’s voice was full of brusque confidence, but Catelyn found herself wishing </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that Robb had not taken her uncle Brynden west with him. The Blackfish was the veteran of </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="494" height="15" font="1">half a hundred battles; Edmure was the veteran of one, and that one lost. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The plan’s a good one,” he concluded. “Lord Tytos says so, and Lord Jonos as well. </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">When did Blackwood and Bracken agree about <i>anything</i> that was not certain, I ask you?” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Be that as it may.” She was suddenly weary. Perhaps she was wrong to oppose him. </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Perhaps it was a splendid plan, and her misgivings only a woman’s fears. She wished Ned </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">were here, or her uncle Brynden, or . . . “Have you asked Father about this?” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Father is in no state to weigh strategies. Two days ago he was making plans for your </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">marriage to Brandon Stark! Go see him yourself if you do not believe me. This plan will </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="158" height="15" font="1">work, Cat, you’ll see.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I hope so, Edmure. I truly do.” She kissed him on the cheek, to let him know she meant </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">it, and went to find her father. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Hoster Tully was much as she had left him—abed, haggard, flesh pale and clammy. </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">The room smelled of sickness, a cloying odor made up in equal parts of stale sweat and </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">medicine. When she pulled back the drapes, her father gave a low moan, and his eyes fluttered </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="592" height="15" font="1">open. He stared at her as if he could not comprehend who she was or what she wanted. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“Father.” She kissed him. “I am returned.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="599" height="15" font="1">He seemed to know her then. “You’ve come,” he whispered faintly, lips barely moving. </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” she said. “Robb sent me south, but I hurried back.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“South . . . where . . . is the Eyrie south, sweetling? I don’t recall . . . oh, dear heart, I was </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">afraid . . . have you forgiven me, child?” Tears ran down his cheeks. </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You’ve done nothing that needs forgiveness, Father.” She stroked his limp white hair </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">and felt his brow. The fever still burned him from within, despite all the maester’s potions. </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It  was  best,”  her  father  whispered.  “Jon’s  a  good  man,  good . . . strong,  kind . . . take </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">care  of  you . . . he  will . . . and  well-born,  listen  to  me,  you  must,  I’m  your  father . . . your </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="373" height="15" font="1">father . . . you’ll wed when Cat does, yes you <i>will</i> . . .” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>He thinks I’m Lysa</i>, Catelyn realized. <i>Gods be good, he talks as if we were not married </i></text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="28" height="15" font="5"><i>yet.</i> </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Her father’s hands clutched at hers, fluttering like two frightened white birds. “That </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">stripling . . . wretched  boy . . . not  speak  that  name  to  me,  your  duty . . . your  mother,  she </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">would . . .” Lord Hoster cried as a spasm of pain washed over him. “Oh, gods forgive me, </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">forgive me, <i>forgive</i> me. My medicine . . .” </text>
</page>
<page number="304" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And then Maester Vyman was there, holding a cup to his lips. Lord Hoster sucked at the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thick white potion as eager as a babe at the breast, and Catelyn could see peace settle over him </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">once more. “He’ll sleep now, my lady,” the maester said when the cup was empty. The milk </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the poppy had left a thick white film around her father’s mouth. Maester Vyman wiped it </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">away with a sleeve. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could watch no more. Hoster Tully had been a strong man, and proud. It hurt her </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to see him reduced to this. She went out to the terrace. The yard below was crowded with </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">refugees and chaotic with their noises, but beyond the walls the rivers flowed clean and pure </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="581" height="15" font="1">and endless. <i>Those are his rivers, and soon he will return to them for his last voyage.</i> </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Vyman had followed her out. “My lady,” he said softly, “I cannot keep the end </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">at bay much longer. We ought send a rider after his brother. Ser Brynden would wish to be </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">here.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="348" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” Catelyn said, her voice thick with her grief. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="270" height="15" font="1">“And the Lady Lysa as well, perhaps?” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="154" height="15" font="1">“Lysa will not come.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="275" height="15" font="1">“If you wrote her yourself, perhaps . . .” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I will put some words to paper, if that please you.” She wondered who Lysa’s “wretched </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">stripling” had been. Some young squire or hedge knight, like as not . . . though by the </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">vehemence with which Lord Hoster had opposed him, he might have been a tradesman’s son </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">or baseborn apprentice, even a singer. Lysa had always been too fond of singers. <i>I must not </i></text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="5"><i>blame her. Jon Arryn was twenty years older than our father, however noble.</i> </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The tower her brother had set aside for her use was the very same that she and Lysa had </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shared as maids. It would feel good to sleep on a featherbed again, with a warm fire in the </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">hearth; when she was rested the world would seem less bleak. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But outside her chambers she found Utherydes Wayn waiting with two women clad in </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">grey, their faces cowled save for their eyes. Catelyn knew at once why they were here. </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ned?</i>” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The sisters lowered their gaze. Utherydes said, “Ser Cleos brought him from King’s </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">Landing, my lady.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“Take me to him,” she commanded. </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They had laid him out on a trestle table and covered him with a banner, the white banner </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">of House Stark with its grey direwolf sigil. “I would look on him,” Catelyn said. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="241" height="15" font="1">“Only the bones remain, my lady.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="254" height="15" font="1">“I would look on him,” she repeated. </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">One of the silent sisters turned down the banner. </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Bones</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>This is not Ned, this is not the man I loved, the father of my </i></text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>children.</i> His hands were clasped together over his chest, skeletal fingers curled about the hilt </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of some longsword, but they were not Ned’s hands, so strong and full of life. They had </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">dressed the bones in Ned’s surcoat, the fine white velvet with the direwolf badge over the </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heart, but nothing remained of the warm flesh that had pillowed her head so many nights, the </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">arms that had held her. The head had been rejoined to the body with fine silver wire, but one </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">skull looks much like another, and in those empty hollows she found no trace of her lord’s </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">dark grey eyes, eyes that could be soft as a fog or hard as stone. <i>They gave his eyes to crows</i>, </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">she remembered. </text>
<text top="1057" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">Catelyn turned away. “That is not his sword.” </text>

<page number="305" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="575" height="15" font="1">“Ice was not returned to us, my lady,” Utherydes said. “Only Lord Eddard’s bones.” </text>

<text top="154" left="171" width="303" height="15" font="1">“Thank the Imp, my lady. It was his doing.” </text>

<text top="500" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">disappointment. Dany climbed inside wearily, glad for the refuge from the sea of Qartheen </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">eyes. “Make way,” Jhogo shouted at the crowd from horseback, snapping his whip, “make </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="1">way, make way for the Mother of Dragons.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Reclining on cool satin cushions, Xaro Xhoan Daxos poured ruby-red wine into matched </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">goblets of jade and gold, his hands sure and steady despite the sway of the palanquin. “I see a </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deep sadness written upon your face, my light of love.” He offered her a goblet. “Could it be </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">the sadness of a lost dream?” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A dream delayed, no more.” Dany’s tight silver collar was chafing against her throat. </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She unfastened it and flung it aside. The collar was set with an enchanted amethyst that Xaro </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swore would ward her against all poisons. The Pureborn were notorious for offering poisoned </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wine to those they thought dangerous, but they had not given Dany so much as a cup of water. </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>They never saw me for a queen</i>, she thought bitterly. <i>I was only an afternoon’s amusement, a </i></text>

<text top="770" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Rhaegal hissed and dug sharp black claws into her bare shoulder as Dany stretched out a </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hand for the wine. Wincing, she shifted him to her other shoulder, where he could claw her </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gown instead of her skin. She was garbed after the Qartheen fashion. Xaro had warned her </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that the Enthroned would never listen to a Dothraki, so she had taken care to go before them </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in flowing green samite with one breast bared, silvered sandals on her feet, with a belt of </text>

<text top="887" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="5"><i>Perhaps I should have.</i> She drank deep. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Descendants of the ancient kings and queens of Qarth, the Pureborn commanded the </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Civic Guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled the straits between the seas. Daenerys </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Targaryen had wanted that fleet, or part of it, and some of their soldiers as well. She made the </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory, offered the traditional bribe to the Keeper of </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Long List, sent the traditional persimmon to the Opener of the Door, and finally received </text>

<text top="1034" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The Pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their ancestors, rising in </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">vanished glory. The chairs were immense, fantastically carved, bright with goldwork and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">studded with amber, onyx, lapis, and jade, each one different from all the others, and each </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">striving to be the most fabulous. Yet the men who sat in them seemed so listless and world-</text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">weary that they might have been asleep. <i>They listened, but they did not hear, or care</i>, she </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thought.  <i>They are Milk Men indeed. They never meant to help me. They came because they </i></text>
<text top="202" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>were curious. They came because they were bored, and the dragon on my shoulder interested </i></text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="5"><i>them more than I did.</i> </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tell me the words of the Pureborn,” prompted Xaro Xhoan Daxos. “Tell me what they </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">said to sadden the queen of my heart.” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They said no.” The wine tasted of pomegranates and hot summer days. “They said it </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="531" height="15" font="1">with great courtesy, to be sure, but under all the lovely words, it was still no.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="165" height="15" font="1">“Did you flatter them?” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“Shamelessly.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="122" height="15" font="1">“Did you weep?” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="397" height="15" font="1">“The blood of the dragon does not weep,” she said testily. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Xaro sighed. “You ought to have wept.” The Qartheen wept often and easily; it was </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="561" height="15" font="1">considered a mark of the civilized man. “The men we bought, what did they say?” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Mathos said nothing. Wendello praised the way I spoke. The Exquisite refused me with </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="222" height="15" font="1">the rest, but he wept afterward.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Alas, that Qartheen should be so faithless.” Xaro was not himself of the Pureborn, but </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he had told her whom to bribe and how much to offer. “Weep, weep, for the treachery of </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">men.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Dany would sooner have wept for her gold. The bribes she’d tendered to Mathos </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mallarawan, Wendello Qar Deeth, and Egon Emeros the Exquisite might have bought her a </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ship, or hired a score of sellswords. “Suppose I sent Ser Jorah to demand the return of my </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">gifts?” she asked. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Suppose a Sorrowful Man came to my palace one night and killed you as you slept,” </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">said Xaro. The Sorrowful Men were an ancient sacred guild of assassins, so named because </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">they always whispered, “I am so sorry,” to their victims before they killed them. The </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Qartheen were nothing if not polite. “It is wisely said that it is easier to milk the Stone Cow of </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="311" height="15" font="1">Faros than to wring gold from the Pureborn.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany did not know where Faros was, but it seemed to her that Qarth was full of stone </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cows. The merchant princes, grown vastly rich off the trade between the seas, were divided </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">into three jealous factions: the Ancient Guild of Spicers, the Tourmaline Brotherhood, and the </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Thirteen, to which Xaro belonged. Each vied with the others for dominance, and all three </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">contended endlessly with the Pureborn. And brooding over all were the warlocks, with their </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="396" height="15" font="1">blue lips and dread powers, seldom seen but much feared. </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She would have been lost without Xaro. The gold that she had squandered to open the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">doors of the Hall of a Thousand Thrones was largely a product of the merchant’s generosity </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and quick wits. As the rumor of living dragons had spread through the east, ever more seekers </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had come to learn if the tale was true—and Xaro Xhoan Daxos saw to it that the great and the </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="408" height="15" font="1">humble alike offered some token to the Mother of Dragons. </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The trickle he started soon swelled to a flood. Trader captains brought lace from Myr, </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chests of saffron from Yi Ti, amber and dragonglass out of Asshai. Merchants offered bags of </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">coin, silversmiths rings and chains. Pipers piped for her, tumblers tumbled, and jugglers </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">juggled, while dyers draped her in colors she had never known existed. A pair of Jogos Nhai </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">presented her with one of their striped zorses, black and white and fierce. A widow brought </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the dried corpse of her husband, covered with a crust of silvered leaves; such remnants were </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">believed to have great power, especially if the deceased had been a sorcerer, as this one had. </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">And the Tourmaline Brotherhood pressed on her a crown wrought in the shape of a three-</text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">headed dragon; the coils were yellow gold, the wings silver, the heads carved from jade, </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">ivory, and onyx. </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The crown was the only offering she’d kept. The rest she sold, to gather the wealth she </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had wasted on the Pureborn. Xaro would have sold the crown too—the Thirteen would see </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that she had a much finer one, he swore—but Dany forbade it. “Viserys sold my mother’s </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crown, and men called him a beggar. I shall keep this one, so men will call me a queen.” And </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">so she did, though the weight of it made her neck ache. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Yet even crowned, I am a beggar still</i>, Dany thought. <i>I have become the most splendid </i></text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>beggar in the world, but a beggar all the same.</i> She hated it, as her brother must have. <i>All </i></text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>those years of running from city to city one step ahead of the Usurper’s knives, pleading for </i></text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>help from archons and princes and magisters, buying our food with flattery. He must have </i></text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>known how they mocked him. Small wonder he turned so angry and bitter. In the end it had </i></text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>driven him mad. It will do the same to me if I let it.</i> Part of her would have liked nothing more </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">than to lead her people back to Vaes Tolorro, and make the dead city bloom. <i>No, that is </i></text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>defeat. I have something Viserys never had. I have the dragons. The dragons are all the </i></text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="5"><i>difference.</i> </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She stroked Rhaegal. The green dragon closed his teeth around the meat of her hand and </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">nipped hard. Outside, the great city murmured and thrummed and seethed, all its myriad </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">voices blending into one low sound like the surge of the sea. “Make way, you Milk Men, </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">make way for the Mother of Dragons,” Jhogo cried, and the Qartheen moved aside, though </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">perhaps the oxen had more to do with that than his voice. Through the swaying draperies, </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dany caught glimpses of him astride his grey stallion. From time to time he gave one of the </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">oxen a flick with the silver-handled whip she had given him. Aggo guarded on her other side, </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">while Rakharo rode behind the procession, watching the faces in the crowd for any sign of </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">danger. Ser Jorah she had left behind today, to guard her other dragons; the exile knight had </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been opposed to this folly from the start. <i>He distrusts everyone</i>, she reflected, <i>and perhaps for </i></text>
<text top="705" left="139" width="93" height="15" font="5"><i>good reason.</i> </text>
<text top="730" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As Dany lifted her goblet to drink, Rhaegal sniffed at the wine and drew his head back, </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hissing. “Your dragon has a good nose.” Xaro wiped his lips. “The wine is ordinary. It is said </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that across the Jade Sea they make a golden vintage so fine that one sip makes all other wines </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">taste like vinegar. Let us take my pleasure barge and go in search of it, you and I.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The Arbor makes the best wine in the world,” Dany declared. Lord Redwyne had fought </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for her father against the Usurper, she remembered, one of the few to remain true to the last. </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Will he fight for me as well?</i> There was no way to be certain after so many years. “Come with </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">me to the Arbor, Xaro, and you’ll have the finest vintages you ever tasted. But we’ll need to </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">go in a warship, not a pleasure barge.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I have no warships. War is bad for trade. Many times I have told you, Xaro Xhoan </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="181" height="15" font="1">Daxos is a man of peace.” </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a man of gold</i>, she thought, <i>and gold will buy me all the ships and </i></text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="583" height="15" font="5"><i>swords I need.</i> “I have not asked you to take up a sword, only to lend me your ships.” </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He smiled modestly. “Of trading ships I have a few, that is so. Who can say how many? </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">One may be sinking even now, in some stormy corner of the Summer Sea. On the morrow, </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">another will fall afoul of corsairs. The next day, one of my captains may look at the wealth in </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his hold and think, <i>All this should belong to me.</i> Such are the perils of trade. Why, the longer </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">we talk, the fewer ships I am likely to have. I grow poorer by the instant.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="336" height="15" font="1">“Give me ships, and I will make you rich again.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Marry me, bright light, and sail the ship of my heart. I cannot sleep at night for thinking </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">of your beauty.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany smiled. Xaro’s flowery protestations of passion amused her, but his manner was at </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">odds with his words. While Ser Jorah had scarcely been able to keep his eyes from her bare </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">breast when he’d helped her into the palanquin, Xaro hardly deigned to notice it, even in these </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">close confines. And she had seen the beautiful boys who surrounded the merchant prince, </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flitting through his palace halls in wisps of silk. “You speak sweetly, Xaro, but under your </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">words I hear another <i>no</i>.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“This Iron Throne you speak of sounds monstrous cold and hard. I cannot bear the </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">thought of jagged barbs cutting your sweet skin.” The jewels in Xaro’s nose gave him the </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">aspect of some strange glittery bird. His long, elegant fingers waved dismissal. “Let this be </text>

<text top="502" left="139" width="311" height="15" font="1">moment, stirring the still air in the palanquin. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A single perfect tear ran down the cheek of Xaro Xhoan Daxos. “Will nothing turn you </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">from this madness?” </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Nothing,” she said, wishing she was as certain as she sounded. “If each of the Thirteen </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">would lend me ten ships—” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You would have one hundred thirty ships, and no crew to sail them. The justice of your </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cause means naught to the common men of Qarth. Why should my sailors care who sits upon </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="375" height="15" font="1">the throne of some kingdom at the edge of the world?” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="177" height="15" font="1">“I will pay them to care.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="303" height="15" font="1">“With what coin, sweet star of my heaven?” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="236" height="15" font="1">“With the gold the seekers bring.” </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That you may do,” Xaro acknowledged, “but so much caring will cost dear. You will </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="595" height="15" font="1">need to pay them far more than I do, and all of Qarth laughs at my ruinous generosity.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“If the Thirteen will not aid me, perhaps I should ask the Guild of Spicers or the </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">Tourmaline Brotherhood?” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Xaro gave a languid shrug. “They will give you nothing but flattery and lies. The Spicers </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="471" height="15" font="1">are dissemblers and braggarts and the Brotherhood is full of pirates.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">“Then I must heed Pyat Pree, and go to the warlocks.” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The merchant prince sat up sharply. “Pyat Pree has blue lips, and it is truly said that blue </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">lips speak only lies. Heed the wisdom of one who loves you. Warlocks are bitter creatures </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="407" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” Dany said. “But it was ships and soldiers I wanted.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Did I not give you an army, sweetest of women? A thousand knights, each in shining </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">armor.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The armor had been made of silver and gold, the knights of jade and beryl and onyx and </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tourmaline, of amber and opal and amethyst, each as tall as her little finger. “A thousand </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lovely knights,” she said, “but not the sort my enemies need fear. And my bullocks cannot </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="572" height="15" font="1">carry me across the water, I—why are we stopping?” The oxen had slowed notably. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“<i>Khaleesi</i>,” Aggo called through the drapes as the palanquin jerked to a sudden halt. </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dany rolled onto an elbow to lean out. They were on the fringes of the bazaar, the way ahead </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">blocked by a solid wall of people. “What are they looking at?” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">Jhogo rode back to her. “A firemage, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="110" height="15" font="1">“I want to see.” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then you must.” The Dothraki offered a hand down. When she took it, he pulled her up </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">onto his horse and sat her in front of him, where she could see over the heads of the crowd. </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The firemage had conjured a ladder in the air, a crackling orange ladder of swirling flame that </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">rose unsupported from the floor of the bazaar, reaching toward the high latticed roof. </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Most of the spectators, she noticed, were not of the city: she saw sailors off trading ships, </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">merchants come by caravan, dusty men out of the red waste, wandering soldiers, craftsmen, </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">slavers. Jhogo slid one hand about her waist and leaned close. “The Milk Men shun him. </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="572" height="15" font="5"><i>Khaleesi</i>, do you see the girl in the felt hat? There, behind the fat priest. She is a—” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“—cutpurse,” finished Dany. She was no pampered lady, blind to such things. She had </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seen cutpurses aplenty in the streets of the Free Cities, during the years she’d spent with her </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="339" height="15" font="1">brother, running from the Usurper’s hired knives. </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The mage was gesturing, urging the flames higher and higher with broad sweeps of his </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">arms. As the watchers craned their necks upward, the cutpurses squirmed through the press, </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">small blades hidden in their palms. They relieved the prosperous of their coin with one hand </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="260" height="15" font="1">while pointing upward with the other. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the fiery ladder stood forty feet high, the mage leapt forward and began to climb it, </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scrambling up hand over hand as quick as a monkey. Each rung he touched dissolved behind </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him, leaving no more than a wisp of silver smoke. When he reached the top, the ladder was </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">gone and so was he. </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="340" height="15" font="1">“A fine trick,” announced Jhogo with admiration. </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“No trick,” a woman said in the Common Tongue. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Dany had not noticed Quaithe in the crowd, yet there she stood, eyes wet and shiny </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">behind the implacable red lacquer mask. “What mean you, my lady?” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Half a year gone, that man could scarcely wake fire from dragonglass. He had some </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">small skill with powders and wildfire, sufficient to entrance a crowd while his cutpurses did </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their work. He could walk across hot coals and make burning roses bloom in the air, but he </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could no more aspire to climb the fiery ladder than a common fisherman could hope to catch a </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">kraken in his nets.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany looked uneasily at where the ladder had stood. Even the smoke was gone now, and </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the crowd was breaking up, each man going about his business. In a moment more than a few </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="357" height="15" font="1">would find their purses flat and empty. “And now?” </text>
</page>
<page number="310" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="461" height="15" font="1">“And now his powers grow, <i>Khaleesi</i>. And you are the cause of it.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“Me?” She laughed. “How could that be?” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The woman stepped closer and lay two fingers on Dany’s wrist. “You are the Mother of </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="161" height="15" font="1">Dragons, are you not?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“She is, and no spawn of shadows may touch her.” Jhogo brushed Quaithe’s fingers away </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">with the handle of his whip. </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The woman took a step backward. “You must leave this city soon, Daenerys Targaryen, </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="330" height="15" font="1">or you will never be permitted to leave it at all.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany’s wrist still tingled where Quaithe had touched her. “Where would you have me </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="110" height="15" font="1">go?” she asked. </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="584" height="15" font="1">forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Asshai</i>, Dany thought. <i>She would have me go to Asshai.</i> “Will the Asshai’i give me an </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">army?” she demanded. “Will there be gold for me in Asshai? Will there be ships? What is </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="309" height="15" font="1">there in Asshai that I will not find in Qarth?” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="562" height="15" font="1">“Truth,” said the woman in the mask. And bowing, she faded back into the crowd. </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Rakharo snorted contempt through his drooping black mustachios. “<i>Khaleesi</i>, better a </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">man should swallow scorpions than trust in the spawn of shadows, who dare not show their </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="238" height="15" font="1">face beneath the sun. It is known.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="195" height="15" font="1">“It is known,” Aggo agreed. </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Xaro Xhoan Daxos had watched the whole exchange from his cushions. When Dany </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">climbed back into the palanquin beside him, he said, “Your savages are wiser than they know. </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Such truths as the Asshai’i hoard are not like to make you smile.” Then he pressed another </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="636" height="15" font="1">cup of wine on her, and spoke of love and lust and other trifles all the way back to his manse. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In the quiet of her chambers, Dany stripped off her finery and donned a loose robe of </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">purple silk. Her dragons were hungry, so she chopped up a snake and charred the pieces over </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a brazier. <i>They are growing</i>, she realized as she watched them snap and squabble over the </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blackened flesh. <i>They must weigh twice what they had in Vaes Tolorro.</i> Even so, it would be </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">years before they were large enough to take to war. <i>And they must be trained as well, or they </i></text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>will lay my kingdom waste.</i> For all her Targaryen blood, Dany had not the least idea of how to </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">train a dragon. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah Mormont came to her as the sun was going down. “The Pureborn refused </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">you?” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As you said they would. Come, sit, give me your counsel.” Dany drew him down to the </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cushions beside her, and Jhiqui brought them a bowl of purple olives and onions drowned in </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">wine. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You will get no help in this city, <i>Khaleesi</i>.” Ser Jorah took an onion between thumb and </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forefinger. “Each day I am more convinced of that than the day before. The Pureborn see no </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">farther than the walls of Qarth, and Xaro . . .” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="245" height="15" font="1">“He asked me to marry him again.” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes, and I know why.” When the knight frowned, his heavy black brows joined together </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="168" height="15" font="1">above his deep-set eyes. </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">“He dreams of me, day and night.” She laughed. </text>
<text top="1049" left="171" width="420" height="15" font="1">“Forgive me, my queen, but it is your dragons he dreams of.” </text>

<page number="311" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Xaro assures me that in Qarth, man and woman each retain their own property after they </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">are wed. The dragons are mine.” She smiled as Drogon came hopping and flapping across the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">marble floor to crawl up on the cushion beside her. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He tells it true as far as it goes, but there’s one thing he failed to mention. The Qartheen </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have a curious wedding custom, my queen. On the day of their union, a wife may ask a token </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of love from her husband. Whatsoever she desires of his worldly goods, he must grant. And </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he may ask the same of her. One thing only may be asked, but whatever is named may not be </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="61" height="15" font="1">denied.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="382" height="15" font="1">“One thing,” she repeated. “And it may not be denied?” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“With one dragon, Xaro Xhoan Daxos would rule this city, but one ship will further our </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">cause but little.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany nibbled at an onion and reflected ruefully on the faithlessness of men. “We passed </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">through the bazaar on our way back from the Hall of a Thousand Thrones,” she told Ser Jorah. </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Quaithe was there.” She told him of the firemage and the fiery ladder, and what the woman </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">in the red mask had told her. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I would be glad to leave this city, if truth be told,” the knight said when she was done. </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="148" height="15" font="1">“But not for Asshai.” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="110" height="15" font="1">“Where, then?” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="109" height="15" font="1">“East,” he said. </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am half a world away from my kingdom even here. If I go any farther east I may never </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">find my way home to Westeros.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="246" height="15" font="1">“If you go west, you risk your life.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“House Targaryen has friends in the Free Cities,” she reminded him. “Truer friends than </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">Xaro or the Pureborn.” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“If you mean Illyrio Mopatis, I wonder. For sufficient gold, Illyrio would sell you as </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">quickly as he would a slave.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My brother and I were guests in Illyrio’s manse for half a year. If he meant to sell us, he </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">could have done it then.” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="357" height="15" font="1">“He did sell you,” Ser Jorah said. “To Khal Drogo.” </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany flushed. He had the truth of it, but she did not like the sharpness with which he put </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">it. “Illyrio protected us from the Usurper’s knives, and he believed in my brother’s cause.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Illyrio believes in no cause but Illyrio. Gluttons are greedy men as a rule, and magisters </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">are devious. Illyrio Mopatis is both. What do you truly know of him?” </text>
<text top="837" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">“I know that he gave me my dragon eggs.” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">He snorted. “If he’d known they were like to hatch, he would have sat on them himself.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">That made her smile despite herself. “Oh, I have no doubt of that, ser. I know Illyrio </text>

<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The girl never wept. Young as she was, Myrcella Baratheon was a princess born. <i>And a </i></text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="620" height="15" font="5"><i>Lannister, despite her name</i>, Tyrion reminded himself, <i>as much Jaime’s blood as Cersei’s.</i> </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">To be sure, her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took their leave of her on </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the deck of the <i>Seaswift</i>, but the girl knew the proper words to say, and she said them with </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">courage and dignity. When the time came to part, it was Prince Tommen who cried, and </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">Myrcella who gave him comfort. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion looked down upon the farewells from the high deck of <i>King Robert’s Hammer</i>, a </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">great war galley of four hundred oars. <i>Rob’s Hammer</i>, as her oarsmen called her, would form </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the main strength of Myrcella’s escort. <i>Lionstar</i>, <i>Bold Wind</i>, and <i>Lady Lyanna</i> would sail with </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="82" height="15" font="1">her as well. </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">It made Tyrion more than a little uneasy to detach so great a part of their already </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">inadequate fleet, depleted as it was by the loss of all those ships that had sailed with Lord </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Stannis to Dragonstone and never returned, but Cersei would hear of nothing less. Perhaps she </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was wise. If the girl was captured before she reached Sunspear, the Dornish alliance would </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fall to pieces. So far Doran Martell had done no more than call his banners. Once Myrcella </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was safe in Braavos, he had pledged to move his strength to the high passes, where the threat </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">might make some of the Marcher lords rethink their loyalties and give Stannis pause about </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">marching north. It was purely a feint, however. The Martells would not commit to actual </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">battle unless Dorne itself was attacked, and Stannis was not so great a fool. <i>Though some of </i></text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="5"><i>his bannermen may be</i>, Tyrion reflected. <i>I should think on that.</i> </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">He cleared his throat. “You know your orders, Captain.” </text>

<page number="313" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I do, my lord. We are to follow the coast, staying always in sight of land, until we reach </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Crackclaw Point. From there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for Braavos. On no </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">account are we to sail within sight of Dragonstone.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“And if our foes should chance upon you nonetheless?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“If a single ship, we are to run them off or destroy them. If there are more, the <i>Bold Wind</i> </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="538" height="15" font="1">will cleave to the <i>Seaswift</i> to protect her while the rest of the fleet does battle.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Tyrion nodded. If the worst happened, the little <i>Seaswift</i> ought to be able to outrun </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pursuit. A small ship with big sails, she was faster than any warship afloat, or so her captain </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had claimed. Once Myrcella reached Braavos, she ought to be safe. He was sending Ser Arys </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Oakheart as her sworn shield, and had engaged the Braavosi to bring her the rest of the way to </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Sunspear. Even Lord Stannis would hesitate to wake the anger of the greatest and most </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">powerful of the Free Cities. Traveling from King’s Landing to Dorne by way of Braavos was </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">scarcely the most direct of routes, but it <i>was</i> the safest . . . or so he hoped. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>If Lord Stannis knew of this sailing, he could not choose a better time to send his fleet </i></text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>against us.</i> Tyrion glanced back to where the Rush emptied out into Blackwater Bay and was </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">relieved to see no signs of sails on the wide green horizon. At last report, the Baratheon fleet </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">still lay off Storm’s End, where Ser Cortnay Penrose continued to defy the besiegers in dead </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Renly’s name. Meanwhile, Tyrion’s winch towers stood three-quarters complete. Even now </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">men were hoisting heavy blocks of stone into place, no doubt cursing him for making them </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">work through the festivities. Let them curse. <i>Another fortnight, Stannis, that’s all I require. </i></text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="5"><i>Another fortnight and it will be done.</i> </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion watched his niece kneel before the High Septon to receive his blessing on her </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">voyage. Sunlight caught in his crystal crown and spilled rainbows across Myrcella’s upturned </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face. The noise from the riverside made it impossible to hear the prayers. He hoped the gods </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had sharper ears. The High Septon was as fat as a house, and more pompous and long of wind </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">than even Pycelle. <i>Enough, old man, make an end to it</i>, Tyrion thought irritably. <i>The gods </i></text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="5"><i>have better things to do than listen to you, and so do I.</i> </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When at last the droning and mumbling was done, Tyrion took his farewell of the captain </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of  <i>Rob’s Hammer</i>. “Deliver my niece safely to Braavos, and there will be a knighthood </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">waiting for you on your return,” he promised. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As he made his way down the steep plank to the quay, Tyrion could feel unkind eyes </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">upon him. The galley rocked gently and the movement underfoot made his waddle worse than </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ever. <i>I’ll wager they’d love to snigger.</i> No one dared, not openly, though he heard mutterings </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mingled with the creak of wood and rope and the rush of the river around the pilings. <i>They do </i></text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>not love me</i>, he thought. <i>Well, small wonder. I’m well fed and ugly, and they are starving.</i> </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bronn escorted him through the crowd to join his sister and her sons. Cersei ignored him, </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">preferring to lavish her smiles on their cousin. He watched her charming Lancel with eyes as </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">green as the rope of emeralds around her slim white throat, and smiled a small sly smile to </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself. <i>I know your secret, Cersei</i>, he thought. His sister had oft called upon the High Septon </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of late, to seek the blessings of the gods in their coming struggle with Lord Stannis . . . or so </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she would have him believe. In truth, after a brief call at the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would don a plain brown traveler’s cloak and steal off to meet a certain hedge knight with the </text>
<text top="967" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">unlikely name of Ser Osmund Kettleblack, and his equally unsavory brothers Osney and </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Osfryd. Lancel had told him all about them. Cersei meant to use the Kettleblacks to buy her </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">own force of sellswords. </text>
<text top="1031" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Well, let her enjoy her plots. She was much sweeter when she thought she was outwitting </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him. The Kettleblacks would charm her, take her coin, and promise her anything she asked, </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and why not, when Bronn was matching every copper penny, coin for coin? Amiable rogues </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all three, the brothers were in truth much more skilled at deceit than they’d ever been at </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bloodletting. Cersei had managed to buy herself three hollow drums; they would make all the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="625" height="15" font="1">fierce booming sounds she required, but there was nothing inside. It amused Tyrion no end. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Horns blew fanfares as <i>Lionstar</i> and <i>Lady Lyanna</i> pushed out from shore, moving </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">downriver to clear the way for <i>Seaswift</i>. A few cheers went up from the crush along the banks, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as thin and ragged as the clouds scuttling overhead. Myrcella smiled and waved from the </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">deck. Behind her stood Arys Oakheart, his white cloak streaming. The captain ordered lines </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">cast off, and oars pushed the <i>Seaswift</i> out into the lusty current of the Blackwater Rush, where </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her sails blossomed in the wind—common white sails, as Tyrion had insisted, not sheets of </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Lannister crimson. Prince Tommen sobbed. “You mew like a suckling babe,” his brother </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="325" height="15" font="1">hissed at him. “Princes aren’t supposed to cry.” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Prince Aemon the Dragonknight cried the day Princess Naerys wed his brother Aegon,” </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sansa Stark said, “and the twins Ser Arryk and Ser Erryk died with tears on their cheeks after </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">each had given the other a mortal wound.” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Be quiet, or I’ll have Ser Meryn give <i>you</i> a mortal wound,” Joffrey told his betrothed. </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Tyrion glanced at his sister, but Cersei was engrossed in something Ser Balon Swann was </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="465" height="15" font="1">telling her. <i>Can she truly be so blind as to what he is?</i> he wondered. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Out on the river, <i>Bold Wind</i> unshipped her oars and glided downstream in the wake of </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>Seaswift</i>. Last came <i>King Robert’s Hammer</i>, the might of the royal fleet . . . or at least that </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">portion that had not fled to Dragonstone last year with Stannis. Tyrion had chosen the ships </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="652" height="15" font="1">with care, avoiding any whose captains might be of doubtful loyalty, according to </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Varys . . . but as Varys himself was of doubtful loyalty, a certain amount of apprehension </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remained. <i>I rely too much on Varys</i>, he reflected. <i>I need my own informers. Not that I’d trust </i></text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="5"><i>them either.</i> Trust would get you killed. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He wondered again about Littlefinger. There had been no word from Petyr Baelish since </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">he had ridden off for Bitterbridge. That might mean nothing—or everything. Even Varys </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could not say. The eunuch had suggested that perhaps Littlefinger had met some misfortune </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">on the roads. He might even be slain. Tyrion had snorted in derision. “If Littlefinger is dead, </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">then I’m a giant.” More likely, the Tyrells were balking at the proposed marriage. Tyrion </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could scarcely blame them. <i>If I were Mace Tyrell, I would sooner have Joffrey’s head on a </i></text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="237" height="15" font="5"><i>pike than his cock in my daughter.</i> </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The little fleet was well out into the bay when Cersei indicated that it was time to go. </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bronn brought Tyrion’s horse and helped him mount. That was Podrick Payne’s task, but they </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had left Pod back at the Red Keep. The gaunt sellsword made for a much more reassuring </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">presence than the boy would have. </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The narrow streets were lined by men of the City Watch, holding back the crowd with the </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shafts of their spears. Ser Jacelyn Bywater went in front, heading a wedge of mounted lancers </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in black ringmail and golden cloaks. Behind him came Ser Aron Santagar and Ser Balon </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">Swann, bearing the king’s banners, the lion of Lannister and crowned stag of Baratheon. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">King Joffrey followed on a tall grey palfrey, a golden crown set upon his golden curls. </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Sansa Stark rode a chestnut mare at his side, looking neither right nor left, her thick auburn </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hair flowing to her shoulders beneath a net of moonstones. Two of the Kingsguard flanked the </text>

<text top="1012" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Next came Tommen, snuffling, with Ser Preston Greenfield in his white armor and cloak, </text>

<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">line of spears. <i>I like this not one speck</i>, Tyrion thought. Bronn had a score of sellswords </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">scattered through the crowd with orders to stop any trouble before it started. Perhaps Cersei </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">had similarly disposed her Kettleblacks. Somehow Tyrion did not think it would help much. If </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the fire was too hot, you could hardly keep the pudding from scorching by tossing a handful </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="139" height="15" font="1">of raisins in the pot. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They crossed Fishmonger’s Square and rode along Muddy Way before turning onto the </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">narrow, curving Hook to begin their climb up Aegon’s High Hill. A few voices raised a cry of </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“<i>Joffrey! All hail, all hail!</i>” as the young king rode by, but for every man who picked up the </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shout, a hundred kept their silence. The Lannisters moved through a sea of ragged men and </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hungry women, breasting a tide of sullen eyes. Just ahead of him, Cersei was laughing at </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">something Lancel had said, though he suspected her merriment was feigned. She could not be </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">oblivious to the unrest around them, but his sister always believed in putting on the brave </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">show. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Halfway along the route, a wailing woman forced her way between two watchmen and </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions, holding the corpse of her dead </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">baby above her head. It was blue and swollen, grotesque, but the real horror was the mother’s </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">eyes. Joffrey looked for a moment as if he meant to ride her down, but Sansa Stark leaned </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">over and said something to him. The king fumbled in his purse, and flung the woman a silver </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stag. The coin bounced off the child and rolled away, under the legs of the gold cloaks and </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">into the crowd, where a dozen men began to fight for it. The mother never once blinked. Her </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of her son. </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Leave her, Your Grace,” Cersei called out to the king, “she’s beyond our help, poor </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">thing.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The mother heard her. Somehow the queen’s voice cut through the woman’s ravaged </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">wits. Her slack face twisted in loathing. “<i>Whore!</i>” she shrieked. “<i>Kingslayer’s whore! </i></text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Brotherfucker!</i>” Her dead child dropped from her arms like a sack of flour as she pointed at </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">Cersei. “<i>Brotherfucker brotherfucker brotherfucker.</i>” </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Tyrion never saw who threw the dung. He only heard Sansa’s gasp and Joffrey’s </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bellowed curse, and when he turned his head, the king was wiping brown filth from his cheek. </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">There was more caked in his golden hair and spattered over Sansa’s legs. </text>
<text top="786" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Who threw that?” Joffrey screamed. He pushed his fingers into his hair, made a furious </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face, and flung away another handful of dung. “I want the man who threw that!” he shouted. </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="405" height="15" font="1">“A hundred golden dragons to the man who gives him up.” </text>
<text top="850" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He was up there!” someone shouted from the crowd. The king wheeled his horse in a </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">circle to survey the rooftops and open balconies above them. In the crowd people were </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="357" height="15" font="1">pointing, shoving, cursing one another and the king. </text>
<text top="914" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“Please, Your Grace, let him go,” Sansa pleaded. </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The king paid her no heed. “Bring me the man who flung that filth!” Joffrey commanded. </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">“He’ll lick it off me or I’ll have his head. Dog, you bring him here!” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Obedient, Sandor Clegane swung down from his saddle, but there was no way through </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that wall of flesh, let alone to the roof. Those closest to him began to squirm and shove to get </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">away, while others pushed forward to see. Tyrion smelled disaster. “Clegane, leave off, the </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="126" height="15" font="1">man is long fled.” </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A tumult of sound drowned his last words, a rolling thunder of rage and fear and hatred </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">that engulfed them from all sides. “<i>Bastard!</i>” someone screamed at Joffrey, “<i>bastard </i></text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>monster</i>.” Other voices flung calls of “<i>Whore</i>” and “<i>Brotherfucker</i>” at the queen, while Tyrion </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was pelted with shouts of “<i>Freak</i>” and “<i>Halfman</i>.” Mixed in with the abuse, he heard a few </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">cries of “<i>Justice</i>” and “<i>Robb, King Robb, the Young Wolf</i>,” of “<i>Stannis!</i>” and even “<i>Renly!</i>” </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">From both sides of the street, the crowd surged against the spear shafts while the gold cloaks </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">struggled to hold the line. Stones and dung and fouler things whistled overhead. “Feed us!” a </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">woman shrieked. “Bread!” boomed a man behind her. “<i>We want bread</i>, bastard!” In a </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heartbeat, a thousand voices took up the chant. King Joffrey and King Robb and King Stannis </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="587" height="15" font="1">were forgotten, and King Bread ruled alone. “<i>Bread</i>,” they clamored. “<i>Bread, bread!</i>” </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion spurred to his sister’s side, yelling, “Back to the castle. <i>Now.</i>” Cersei gave a curt </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">nod, and Ser Lancel unsheathed his sword. Ahead of the column, Jacelyn Bywater was </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">roaring commands. His riders lowered their lances and drove forward in a wedge. The king </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was wheeling his palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cloaks, grasping for him. One managed to get hold of his leg, but only for an instant. Ser </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Mandon’s sword slashed down, parting hand from wrist. “<i>Ride!</i>” Tyrion shouted at his </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">nephew, giving the horse a sharp <i>smack</i> on the rump. The animal reared, trumpeting, and </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">plunged ahead, the press shattering before him. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion drove into the gap hard on the king’s hooves. Bronn kept pace, sword in hand. A </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">jagged rock flew past his head as he rode, and a rotten cabbage exploded against Ser </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Mandon’s shield. To their left, three gold cloaks went down under the surge, and then the </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">crowd was rushing forward, trampling the fallen men. The Hound had vanished behind, </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">though his riderless horse galloped beside them. Tyrion saw Aron Santagar pulled from the </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">saddle, the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp. Ser Balon Swann dropped the </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Lannister lion to draw his longsword. He slashed right and left as the fallen banner was ripped </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">apart, the thousand ragged pieces swirling away like crimson leaves in a stormwind. In an </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">instant they were gone. Someone staggered in front of Joffrey’s horse and shrieked as the king </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">rode him down. Whether it had been man, woman, or child Tyrion could not have said. </text>
<text top="705" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Joffrey was galloping at his side, whey-faced, with Ser Mandon Moore a white shadow on his </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="31" height="15" font="1">left. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">And suddenly the madness was behind and they were clattering across the cobbled square </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">that fronted on the castle barbican. A line of spearmen held the gates. Ser Jacelyn was </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wheeling his lances around for another charge. The spears parted to let the king’s party pass </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">under the portcullis. Pale red walls loomed up about them, reassuringly high and aswarm with </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="102" height="15" font="1">crossbowmen. </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion did not recall dismounting. Ser Mandon was helping the shaken king off his horse </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">when Cersei, Tommen, and Lancel rode through the gates with Ser Meryn and Ser Boros </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">close behind. Boros had blood smeared along his blade, while Meryn’s white cloak had been </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">torn from his back. Ser Balon Swann rode in helmetless, his mount lathered and bleeding at </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the mouth. Horas Redwyne brought in Lady Tanda, half crazed with fear for her daughter </text>
<text top="950" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lollys, who had been knocked from the saddle and left behind. Lord Gyles, more grey of face </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">than ever, stammered out a tale of seeing the High Septon spilled from his litter, screeching </text>
<text top="989" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">prayers as the crowd swept over him. Jalabhar Xho said he thought he’d seen Ser Preston </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Greenfield of the Kingsguard riding back toward the High Septon’s overturned litter, but he </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion was dimly aware of a maester asking if he was injured. He pushed his way across </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the yard to where his nephew stood, his dung-encrusted crown askew. “Traitors,” Joffrey was </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">babbling excitedly, “I’ll have all their heads, I’ll—” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The dwarf slapped his flushed face so hard the crown flew from Joffrey’s head. Then he </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="565" height="15" font="1">shoved him with both hands and knocked him sprawling. “You blind bloody <i>fool</i>.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“They were traitors,” Joffrey squealed from the ground. “They called me names and </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="1">attacked me!” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>You set your dog on them!</i> What did you imagine they would do, bend the knee meekly </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">while the Hound lopped off some limbs? You spoiled witless little boy, you’ve killed Clegane </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and gods know how many more, and yet you come through unscratched. <i>Damn you!</i>” And he </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kicked him. It felt so good he might have done more, but Ser Mandon Moore pulled him off </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as Joffrey howled, and then Bronn was there to take him in hand. Cersei knelt over her son, </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">while Ser Balon Swann restrained Ser Lancel. Tyrion wrenched free of Bronn’s grip. “How </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">many are still out there?” he shouted to no one and everyone. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="561" height="15" font="1">“My daughter,” cried Lady Tanda. “Please, someone must go back for Lollys . . .” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="539" height="15" font="1">“Ser Preston is not returned,” Ser Boros Blount reported, “nor Aron Santagar.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Nor Wet Nurse,” said Ser Horas Redwyne. That was the mocking name the other </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">squires had hung on young Tyrek Lannister. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">Tyrion glanced round the yard. “Where’s the Stark girl?” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">For a moment no one answered. Finally Joffrey said, “She was riding by me. I don’t </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">know where she went.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Tyrion pressed blunt fingers into his throbbing temples. If Sansa Stark had come to harm, </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">Jaime was as good as dead. “Ser Mandon, you were her shield.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Mandon Moore remained untroubled. “When they mobbed the Hound, I thought first </text>

<text top="653" left="171" width="508" height="15" font="1">“And rightly so,” Cersei put in. “Boros, Meryn, go back and find the girl.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="407" height="15" font="1">“And my daughter,” Lady Tanda sobbed. “Please, sers . . .” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Boros did not look pleased at the prospect of leaving the safety of the castle. “Your </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">Grace,” he told the queen, “the sight of our white cloaks might enrage the mob.” </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had stomached all he cared to. “The Others take your fucking cloaks! <i>Take them </i></text>

<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Boros went purple with rage. “You would call <i>me</i> ugly, <i>you?</i>” He started to raise the </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bloody sword still clutched in his mailed fist. Bronn shoved Tyrion unceremoniously behind </text>

<text top="895" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Stop it!</i>” Cersei snapped. “Boros, you’ll do as you’re bid, or we’ll find someone else to </text>

<text top="940" left="171" width="285" height="15" font="1">“There she is!” Joffrey shouted, pointing. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sandor Clegane cantered briskly through the gates astride Sansa’s chestnut courser. The </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="448" height="15" font="1">girl was seated behind, both arms tight around the Hound’s chest. </text>
<text top="1010" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">Tyrion called to her. “Are you hurt, Lady Sansa?” </text>
<text top="1035" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Blood was trickling down Sansa’s brow from a deep gash on her scalp. “They . . . they </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them. A man tried to pull me from the saddle. The Hound killed him, I think . . . his arm . . .” </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">Her eyes widened and she put a hand over her mouth. “He <i>cut off his arm</i>.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Clegane lifted her to the ground. His white cloak was torn and stained, and blood seeped </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through a jagged tear in his left sleeve. “The little bird’s bleeding. Someone take her back to </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">her cage and see to that cut.” Maester Frenken scurried forward to obey. “They did for </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Santagar,” the Hound continued. “Four men held him down and took turns bashing at his head </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">with a cobblestone. I gutted one, not that it did Ser Aron much good.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">Lady Tanda approached him. “My daughter—” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Never saw her.” The Hound glanced around the yard, scowling. “Where’s my horse? If </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="414" height="15" font="1">anything’s happened to that horse, someone’s going to pay.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He was running with us for a time,” Tyrion said, “but I don’t know what became of him </text>

<text top="366" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Fire!</i>” a voice screamed down from atop the barbican. “My lords, there’s smoke in the </text>

<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">For half a heartbeat, Tyrion thought he glimpsed fear in the Hound’s dark eyes. <i>Fire</i>, he </text>

<text top="597" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion turned to the three remaining knights of the Kingsguard. “Each of you will ride </text>

<text top="661" left="171" width="411" height="15" font="1">“Our place is beside the king,” Ser Meryn said, complacent. </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei reared up like a viper. “Your place is where my brother says it is,” she spit. “The </text>

<text top="731" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Boros and Meryn exchanged a look. “Should we wear our cloaks, Your Grace?” Ser </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="92" height="15" font="1">Boros asked. </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Go naked for all I care. It might remind the mob that you’re men. They’re like to have </text>

<text top="820" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion let his sister rage. His head was throbbing. He thought he could smell smoke, </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="393" height="15" font="1">though perhaps it was just the scent of his nerves fraying. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Two of the Stone Crows guarded the door of the Tower of the Hand. “Find me Timett </text>

<text top="1004" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">It was an effort not to scream. “Wake. Him.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The clansman wandered in yawning and scratching. “Half the city is rioting, the other </text>

<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yet by evenfall the city was still in turmoil, though Bronn reported that the fires were </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">quenched and most of the roving mobs dispersed. Much as Tyrion yearned for the comfort of </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="392" height="15" font="1">Shae’s arms, he realized he would go nowhere that night. </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Jacelyn Bywater delivered the butcher’s bill as he was supping on a cold capon and </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">brown bread in the gloom of his solar. Dusk had faded to darkness by then, but when his </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">servants came to light his candles and start a fire in the hearth, Tyrion had roared at them and </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">sent them running. His mood was as black as the chamber, and Bywater said nothing to </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">lighten it. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The list of the slain was topped by the High Septon, ripped apart as he squealed to his </text>

<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Preston’s corpse had been overlooked at first; the gold cloaks had been searching for </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">a knight in white armor, and he had been stabbed and hacked so cruelly that he was red-brown </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="128" height="15" font="1">from head to heel. </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="603" height="15" font="1">Ser Aron Santagar had been found in a gutter, his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm. </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lady Tanda’s daughter had surrendered her maidenhood to half a hundred shouting men </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">behind a tanner’s shop. The gold cloaks found her wandering naked on Sowbelly Row. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrek was still missing, as was the High Septon’s crystal crown. Nine gold cloaks had </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="638" height="15" font="1">been slain, two score wounded. No one had troubled to count how many of the mob had died. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I want Tyrek found, alive or dead,” Tyrion said curtly when Bywater was done. “He’s </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="577" height="15" font="1">no more than a boy. Son to my late uncle Tygett. His father was always kind to me.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“We’ll find him. The septon’s crown as well.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="511" height="15" font="1">“The Others can bugger each other with the septon’s crown, for all I care.” </text>

<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Somehow I have a feeling I am not going to like whatever you’re about to say,” Tyrion </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="101" height="15" font="1">said gloomily. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We held the city today, my lord, but I make no promises for the morrow. The kettle is </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I never expected them to,” said Tyrion. “Once our walls are breeched, we are lost, I’ve </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had made a practice of ignoring the sellsword’s frequent insolences, but tonight </text>

<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Joffrey was his own blood, and Jaime’s son as much as Cersei’s. “I could have your head off </text>

<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrought heraldic beasts with gemstone eyes. Stannis himself looked out of place in this rich </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and royal company. Like Davos, the king was plainly garbed in wool and boiled leather, </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though the circlet of red gold about his temples lent him a certain grandeur. Sunlight flashed </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="390" height="15" font="1">off its flame-shaped points whenever he moved his head. </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">This was the closest Davos had come to His Grace in the eight days since <i>Black Betha</i> </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had joined the rest of the fleet off Storm’s End. He’d sought an audience within an hour of his </text>

<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">learned from his son Devan, one of the royal squires. Now that Stannis Baratheon had come </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">into his power, the lordlings buzzed around him like flies round a corpse. <i>He looks half a </i></text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Is that why she shares his pavilion now?</i> Davos wondered. <i>To pray with him? Or does </i></text>

<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not ask, even of his own son. Devan was a good boy, but he wore the flaming heart proudly </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">on his doublet, and his father had seen him at the nightfires as dusk fell, beseeching the Lord </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of Light to bring the dawn. <i>He is the king’s squire</i>, he told himself, <i>it is only to be expected </i></text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="233" height="15" font="5"><i>that he would take the king’s god.</i> </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Davos had almost forgotten how high and thick the walls of Storm’s End loomed up </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">close. King Stannis halted beneath them, a few feet from Ser Cortnay and his standard-bearer. </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">“Ser,” he said with stiff courtesy. He made no move to dismount. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">“My lord.” That was less courteous, but not unexpected. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“It is customary to grant a king the style <i>Your Grace</i>,” announced Lord Florent. A red-</text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">gold fox poked its shining snout out from his breastplate through a circle of lapis lazuli </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">flowers. Very tall, very courtly, and very rich, the Lord of Brightwater Keep had been the first </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of Renly’s bannermen to declare for Stannis, and the first to renounce his old gods and take </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">up the Lord of Light. Stannis had left his queen on Dragonstone along with her uncle Axell, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">but the queen’s men were more numerous and powerful than ever, and Alester Florent was the </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">foremost. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Ser Cortnay Penrose ignored him, preferring to address Stannis. “This is a notable </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">company. The great lords Estermont, Errol, and Varner. Ser Jon of the green-apple Fossoways </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="652" height="15" font="1">and Ser Bryan of the red. Lord Caron and Ser Guyard of King Renly’s Rainbow </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Guard . . . <i>and</i> the puissant Lord Alester Florent of Brightwater, to be sure. Is that your Onion </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">Knight I spy to the rear? Well met, Ser Davos. I fear I do not know the lady.” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am named Melisandre, ser.” She alone came unarmored, but for her flowing red robes. </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">At her throat the great ruby drank the daylight. “I serve your king, and the Lord of Light.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I wish you well of them, my lady,” Ser Cortnay answered, “but I bow to other gods, and </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">a different king.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="492" height="15" font="1">“There is but one true king, and one true god,” announced Lord Florent. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Are we here to dispute theology, my lord? Had I known, I would have brought a </text>

<text top="764" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“You know full well why we are here,” said Stannis. “You have had a fortnight to </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">consider my offer. You sent your ravens. No help has come. Nor will it. Storm’s End stands </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">alone, and I am out of patience. One last time, ser, I command you to open your gates, and </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="1">deliver me that which is mine by rights.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“And the terms?” asked Ser Cortnay. </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Remain as before,” said Stannis. “I will pardon you for your treason, as I have pardoned </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">these lords you see behind me. The men of your garrison will be free to enter my service or to </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">return unmolested to their homes. You may keep your weapons and as much property as a </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">man can carry. I will require your horses and pack animals, however.” </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="198" height="15" font="1">“And what of Edric Storm?” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“My brother’s bastard must be surrendered to me.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="264" height="15" font="1">“Then my answer is still no, my lord.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">The king clenched his jaw. He said nothing. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Melisandre spoke instead. “May the Lord of Light protect you in your darkness, Ser </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“May the Others bugger your Lord of Light,” Penrose spat back, “and wipe his arse with </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="130" height="15" font="1">that rag you bear.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Lord Alester Florent cleared his throat. “Ser Cortnay, mind your tongue. His Grace </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">means the boy no harm. The child is his own blood, and mine as well. My niece Delena was </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the mother, as all men know. If you will not trust to the king, trust to me. You know me for a </text>

<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I know you for a man of ambition,” Ser Cortnay broke in. “A man who changes kings </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="572" height="15" font="1">and gods the way I change my boots. As do these other turncloaks I see before me.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">An angry clamor went up from the king’s men. <i>He is not far wrong</i>, Davos thought. Only </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">a short time before, the Fossoways, Guyard Morrigen, and the Lords Caron, Varner, Errol, </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Estermont had all belonged to Renly. They had sat in his pavilion, helped him make his </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">battle plans, plotted how Stannis might be brought low. And Lord Florent had been with </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them—he might be Queen Selyse’s own uncle, but that had not kept the Lord of Brightwater </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="422" height="15" font="1">from bending his knee to Renly when Renly’s star was rising. </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Bryce Caron walked his horse forward a few paces, his long rainbow-striped cloak </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">twisting in the wind off the bay. “No man here is a turncloak, ser. My fealty belongs to </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End, and King Stannis is its rightful lord . . . <i>and</i> our true king. He is the last of </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="316" height="15" font="1">House Baratheon, Robert’s heir and Renly’s.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“If that is so, why is the Knight of Flowers not among you? And where is Mathis </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Rowan? Randyll Tarly? Lady Oakheart? Why are they not here in your company, they who </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="392" height="15" font="1">loved Renly best? <i>Where is Brienne of Tarth, I ask you?</i>” </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That one?” Ser Guyard Morrigen laughed harshly. “She ran. As well she might. Hers </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">was the hand that slew the king.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A lie,” Ser Cortnay said. “I knew Brienne when she was no more than a girl playing at </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her father’s feet in Evenfall Hall, and I knew her still better when the Evenstar sent her here to </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End. She loved Renly Baratheon from the first moment she laid eyes on him, a blind </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="126" height="15" font="1">man could see it.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“To be sure,” declared Lord Florent airily, “and she would scarcely be the first maid </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">maddened to murder by a man who spurned her. Though for my own part, I believe it was </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lady Stark who slew the king. She had journeyed all the way from Riverrun to plead for an </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">alliance, and Renly had refused her. No doubt she saw him as a danger to her son, and so </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="106" height="15" font="1">removed him.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It was Brienne,” insisted Lord Caron. “Ser Emmon Cuy swore as much before he died. </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="1">You have my oath on that, Ser Cortnay.” </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Contempt thickened Ser Cortnay’s voice. “And what is that worth? You wear your cloak </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">of many colors, I see. The one Renly gave you when you swore your <i>oath</i> to protect him. If he </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">is dead, how is it you are not?” He turned his scorn on Guyard Morrigen. “I might ask the </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same of you, ser. Guyard the Green, yes? Of the Rainbow Guard? Sworn to give his own life </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">for his king’s? If I had such a cloak, I would be ashamed to wear it.” </text>
<text top="970" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Morrigen bristled. “Be glad this is a parley, Penrose, or I would have your tongue for </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="97" height="15" font="1">those words.” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="414" height="15" font="1">“And cast it in the same fire where you left your manhood?” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Enough!</i>” Stannis said. “The Lord of Light willed that my brother die for his treason. </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">Who did the deed matters not.” </text>
</page>
<page number="324" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Not to <i>you</i>, perhaps,” said Ser Cortnay. “I have heard your proposal, Lord Stannis. Now </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">here is mine.” He pulled off his glove and flung it full in the king’s face. “Single combat. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Sword, lance, or any weapon you care to name. Or if you fear to hazard your magic sword and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">royal skin against an old man, name you a champion, and I shall do the same.” He gave </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Guyard Morrigen and Bryce Caron a scathing look. “Either of these pups would do nicely, I </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">should think.” </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="606" height="15" font="1">Ser Guyard Morrigen grew dark with fury. “I will take up the gage, if it please the king.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">“As would I.” Bryce Caron looked to Stannis. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="227" height="15" font="1">The king ground his teeth. “No.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Cortnay did not seem surprised. “Is it the justice of your cause you doubt, my lord, or </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">the strength of your arm? Are you afraid I’ll piss on your burning sword and put it out?” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Do you take me for an utter fool, ser?” asked Stannis. “I have twenty thousand men. </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">You are besieged by land and sea. Why would I choose single combat when my eventual </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">victory is certain?” The king pointed a finger at him. “I give you fair warning. If you force me </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to take my castle by storm, you may expect no mercy. I will hang you for traitors, every one </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">of you.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As the gods will it. Bring on your storm, my lord—and recall, if you do, the <i>name</i> of </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="542" height="15" font="1">this castle.” Ser Cortnay gave a pull on his reins and rode back toward the gate. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis said no word, but turned his horse around and started back toward his camp. The </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">others followed. “If we storm these walls thousands will die,” fretted ancient Lord Estermont, </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">who was the king’s grandfather on his mother’s side. “Better to hazard but a single life, </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">surely? Our cause is righteous, so the gods must surely bless our champion’s arms with </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">victory.” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>God, old man</i>, thought Davos. <i>You forget, we have only one now, Melisandre’s Lord of </i></text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="5"><i>Light.</i> </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Jon Fossoway said, “I would gladly take this challenge myself, though I’m not half </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the swordsman Lord Caron is, or Ser Guyard. Renly left no notable knights at Storm’s End. </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">Garrison duty is for old men and green boys.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Caron agreed. “An easy victory, to be sure. And what glory, to win Storm’s End </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">with a single stroke!” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis raked them all with a look. “You chatter like magpies, and with less sense. I will </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">have quiet.” The king’s eyes fell on Davos. “Ser. Ride with me.” He spurred his horse away </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from his followers. Only Melisandre kept pace, bearing the great standard of the fiery heart </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">with the crowned stag within. <i>As if it had been swallowed whole.</i> </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos saw the looks that passed between the lordlings as he rode past them to join the </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">king. These were no onion knights, but proud men from houses whose names were old in </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">honor. Somehow he knew that Renly had never chided them in such a fashion. The youngest </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">of the Baratheons had been born with a gift for easy courtesy that his brother sadly lacked. </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He eased back to a slow trot when his horse came up beside the king’s. “Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Seen at close hand, Stannis looked worse than Davos had realized from afar. His face had </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">grown haggard, and he had dark circles under his eyes. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A smuggler must be a fair judge of men,” the king said. “What do you make of this Ser </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">Cortnay Penrose?” </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="280" height="15" font="1">“A stubborn man,” said Davos carefully. </text>

<page number="325" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Hungry for death, I call it. He throws my pardon in my face. Aye, and throws his life </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">away in the bargain, and the lives of every man inside those walls. <i>Single combat?</i>” The king </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">snorted in derision. “No doubt he mistook me for Robert.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="425" height="15" font="1">“More like he was desperate. What other hope does he have?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“None. The castle will fall. But how to do it quickly?” Stannis brooded on that for a </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moment. Under the steady <i>clop-clop</i> of hooves, Davos could hear the faint sound of the king </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">grinding his teeth. “Lord Alester urges me to bring old Lord Penrose here. Ser Cortnay’s </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">father. You know the man, I believe?” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“When I came as your envoy, Lord Penrose received me more courteously than most,” </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="421" height="15" font="1">Davos said. “He is an old done man, sire. Sickly and failing.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Florent would have him fail more visibly. In his son’s sight, with a noose about his </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">neck.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was dangerous to oppose the queen’s men, but Davos had vowed always to tell his </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">king the truth. “I think that would be ill done, my liege. Ser Cortnay will watch his father die </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">before he would ever betray his trust. It would gain us nothing, and bring dishonor to our </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="54" height="15" font="1">cause.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="575" height="15" font="1">“What dishonor?” Stannis bristled. “Would you have me spare the lives of traitors?” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“You have spared the lives of those behind us.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="267" height="15" font="1">“Do you scold me for that, smuggler?” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“It is not my place.” Davos feared he had said too much. </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">The king was relentless. “You esteem this Penrose more than you do my lords </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">bannermen. Why?” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="121" height="15" font="1">“He keeps faith.” </text>
<text top="620" left="171" width="264" height="15" font="1">“A misplaced faith in a dead usurper.” </text>
<text top="645" left="171" width="342" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” Davos admitted, “but still, he keeps faith.” </text>
<text top="670" left="171" width="202" height="15" font="1">“As those behind us do not?” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Davos had come too far with Stannis to play coy now. “Last year they were Robert’s </text>
<text top="715" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">men. A moon ago they were Renly’s. This morning they are yours. Whose will they be on the </text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">morrow?” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And Stannis laughed. A sudden gust, rough and full of scorn. “I told you, Melisandre,” </text>
<text top="779" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">he said to the red woman, “my Onion Knight tells me the truth.” </text>
<text top="804" left="171" width="419" height="15" font="1">“I see you know him well, Your Grace,” the red woman said. </text>
<text top="829" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Davos, I have missed you sorely,” the king said. “Aye, I have a tail of traitors, your nose </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">does not deceive you. My lords bannermen are inconstant even in their treasons. I need them, </text>
<text top="868" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but you should know how it sickens me to pardon such as these when I have punished better </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">men for lesser crimes. You have every right to reproach me, Ser Davos.” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You reproach yourself more than I ever could, Your Grace. You must have these great </text>
<text top="932" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">lords to win your throne—” </text>
<text top="957" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“Fingers and all, it seems.” Stannis smiled grimly. </text>
<text top="982" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Unthinking, Davos raised his maimed hand to the pouch at his throat, and felt the </text>
<text top="1002" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">fingerbones within. <i>Luck.</i> </text>
<text top="1027" left="171" width="602" height="15" font="1">The king saw the motion. “Are they still there, Onion Knight? You have not lost them?” </text>
<text top="1052" left="171" width="44" height="15" font="1">“No.” </text>
</page>
<page number="326" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“Why do you keep them? I have often wondered.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They remind me of what I was. Where I came from. They remind me of your justice, </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="75" height="15" font="1">my liege.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It <i>was</i> justice,” Stannis said. “A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad act the </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">good. Each should have its own reward. You were a hero <i>and</i> a smuggler.” He glanced behind </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">at Lord Florent and the others, rainbow knights and turncloaks, who were following at a </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">distance. “These pardoned lords would do well to reflect on that. Good men and true will fight </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">for Joffrey, wrongly believing him the true king. A northman might even say the same of </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Robb Stark. But these lords who flocked to my brother’s banners <i>knew</i> him for a usurper. </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">They turned their backs on their rightful king for no better reason than dreams of power and </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">glory, and I have marked them for what they are. Pardoned them, yes. Forgiven. But not </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forgotten.” He fell silent for a moment, brooding on his plans for justice. And then, abruptly, </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">he said, “What do the smallfolk say of Renly’s death?” </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="307" height="15" font="1">“They grieve. Your brother was well loved.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Fools love a fool,” grumbled Stannis, “but I grieve for him as well. For the boy he was, </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">not the man he grew to be.” He was silent for a time, and then he said, “How did the </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">commons take the news of Cersei’s incest?” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“While we were among them they shouted for King Stannis. I cannot speak for what they </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">said once we had sailed.” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“So you do not think they believed?” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“When I was smuggling, I learned that some men believe everything and some nothing. </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">We met both sorts. And there is another tale being spread as well—” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” Stannis bit off the word. “Selyse has given me horns, and tied a fool’s bells to the </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">end of each. My daughter fathered by a halfwit jester! A tale as vile as it is absurd. Renly </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">threw it in my teeth when we met to parley. You would need to be as mad as Patchface to </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">believe such a thing.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That may be so, my liege . . . but whether they believe the story or no, they delight to </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">tell it.” In many places it had come before them, poisoning the well for their own true tale. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Robert could piss in a cup and men would call it wine, but I offer them pure cold water </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and they squint in suspicion and mutter to each other about how queer it tastes.” Stannis </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ground his teeth. “If someone said I had magicked myself into a boar to kill Robert, likely </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">they would believe that as well.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“You cannot stop them talking, my liege,” Davos said, “but when you take your </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">vengeance on your brothers’ true killers, the realm will know such tales for lies.” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Stannis only seemed to half hear him. “I have no doubt that Cersei had a hand in Robert’s </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">death. I will have justice for him. Aye, and for Ned Stark and Jon Arryn as well.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="554" height="15" font="1">“And for Renly?” The words were out before Davos could stop to consider them. </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">For a long time the king did not speak. Then, very softly, he said, “I dream of it </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sometimes. Of Renly’s dying. A green tent, candles, a woman screaming. And blood.” Stannis </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">looked down at his hands. “I was still abed when he died. Your Devan will tell you. He tried </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to wake me. Dawn was nigh and my lords were waiting, fretting. I should have been ahorse, </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">armored. I knew Renly would attack at break of day. Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">hands were clean.” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Davos Seaworth could feel his phantom fingertips start to itch. <i>Something is wrong </i></text>
<text top="1065" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="5"><i>here</i>, the onetime smuggler thought. Yet he nodded and said, “I see.” </text>
</page>
<page number="327" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Renly offered me a peach. At our parley. Mocked me, defied me, threatened me, and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">offered me a peach. I thought he was drawing a blade and went for mine own. Was that his </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">purpose, to make me show fear? Or was it one of his pointless jests? When he spoke of how </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">sweet the peach was, did his words have some hidden meaning?” The king gave a shake of his </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">head, like a dog shaking a rabbit to snap its neck. “Only Renly could vex me so with a piece </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of fruit. He brought his doom on himself with his treason, but I did love him, Davos. I know </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">that now. I swear, I will go to my grave thinking of my brother’s peach.” </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">By then they were in amongst the camp, riding past the ordered rows of tents, the </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blowing banners, and the stacks of shields and spears. The stink of horse dung was heavy in </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the air, mingled with the woodsmoke and the smell of cooking meat. Stannis reined up long </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">enough to bark a brusque dismissal to Lord Florent and the others, commanding them to </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">attend him in his pavilion one hour hence for a council of war. They bowed their heads and </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="458" height="15" font="1">dispersed, while Davos and Melisandre rode to the king’s pavilion. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The tent had to be large, since it was there his lords bannermen came to council. Yet </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">there was nothing grand about it. It was a soldier’s tent of heavy canvas, dyed the dark yellow </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">that sometimes passed for gold. Only the royal banner that streamed atop the center pole </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">marked it as a king’s. That, and the guards without; queen’s men leaning on tall spears, with </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="1">the badge of the fiery heart sewn over their own. </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Grooms came up to help them dismount. One of the guards relieved Melisandre of her </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cumbersome standard, driving the staff deep into the soft ground. Devan stood to one side of </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the door, waiting to lift the flap for the king. An older squire waited beside him. Stannis took </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">off his crown and handed it to Devan. “Cold water, cups for two. Davos, attend me. My lady, </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">I shall send for you when I require you.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="313" height="15" font="1">“As the king commands.” Melisandre bowed. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">After the brightness of the morning, the interior of the pavilion seemed cool and dim. </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis seated himself on a plain wooden campstool and waved Davos to another. “One day I </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">may make you a lord, smuggler. If only to irk Celtigar and Florent. You will not thank me, </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though. It will mean you must suffer through these councils, and feign interest in the braying </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="75" height="15" font="1">of mules.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="356" height="15" font="1">“Why do you have them, if they serve no purpose?” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The mules love the sound of their own braying, why else? And I need them to haul my </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cart. Oh, to be sure, once in a great while some useful notion is put forth. But not today, I </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="300" height="15" font="1">think—ah, here’s your son with our water.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Devan set the tray on the table and filled two clay cups. The king sprinkled a pinch of salt </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in his cup before he drank; Davos took his water straight, wishing it were wine. “You were </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">speaking of your council?” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let me tell you how it will go. Lord Velaryon will urge me to storm the castle walls at </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">first light, grapnels and scaling ladders against arrows and boiling oil. The young mules will </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">think this a splendid notion. Estermont will favor settling down to starve them out, as Tyrell </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Redwyne once tried with me. That might take a year, but old mules are patient. And Lord </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Caron and the others who like to kick will want to take up Ser Cortnay’s gauntlet and hazard </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all upon a single combat. Each one imagining <i>he</i> will be my champion and win undying </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="536" height="15" font="1">fame.” The king finished his water. “What would <i>you</i> have me do, smuggler?” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="588" height="15" font="1">Davos considered a moment before he answered. “Strike for King’s Landing at once.” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">The king snorted. “And leave Storm’s End untaken?” </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Ser Cortnay does not have the power to harm you. The Lannisters do. A siege would </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">take too long, single combat is too chancy, and an assault would cost thousands of lives with </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">no certainty of success. And there is no need. Once you dethrone Joffrey this castle must </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">come to you with all the rest. It is said about the camp that Lord Tywin Lannister rushes west </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="425" height="15" font="1">to rescue Lannisport from the vengeance of the northmen . . .” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You have a passing clever father, Devan,” the king told the boy standing by his elbow. </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“He makes me wish I had more smugglers in my service. And fewer lords. Though you are </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrong in one respect, Davos. There <i>is</i> a need. If I leave Storm’s End untaken in my rear, it </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will be said I was defeated here. And that I cannot permit. Men do not love me as they loved </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">my brothers. They follow me because they fear me . . . and defeat is death to fear. The castle </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">must fall.” His jaw ground side to side. “Aye, and <i>quickly</i>. Doran Martell has called his </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">banners and fortified the mountain passes. His Dornishmen are poised to sweep down onto the </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Marches. And Highgarden is far from spent. My brother left the greater part of his power at </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Bitterbridge, near sixty thousand foot. I sent my wife’s brother Ser Errol with Ser Parmen </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Crane to take them under my command, but they have not returned. I fear that Ser Loras </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">Tyrell reached Bitterbridge before my envoys, and took that host for his own.” </text>
<text top="388" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“All the more reason to take King’s Landing as soon as we may. Salladhor Saan told </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">me—” </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Salladhor Saan thinks only of gold!” Stannis exploded. “His head is full of dreams of </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the treasure he fancies lies under the Red Keep, so let us hear no more of Salladhor Saan. The </text>

<text top="491" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">black.” The king made a fist. “Are you here to serve me, smuggler? Or to vex me with </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="90" height="15" font="1">arguments?” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="179" height="15" font="1">“I am yours,” Davos said. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then hear me. Ser Cortnay’s lieutenant is cousin to the Fossoways. Lord Meadows, a </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">green boy of twenty. Should some ill chance strike down Penrose, command of Storm’s End </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would pass to this stripling, and his cousins believe he would accept my terms and yield up </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">the castle.” </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I remember another stripling who was given command of Storm’s End. He could not </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="249" height="15" font="1">have been much more than twenty.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“Lord Meadows is not as stonehead stubborn as I was.” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Stubborn or craven, what does it matter? Ser Cortnay Penrose seemed hale and hearty to </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“So did my brother, the day before his death. The night is dark and full of terrors, </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">Davos.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos Seaworth felt the small hairs rising on the back of his neck. “My lord, I do not </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">understand you.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I do not require your understanding. Only your service. Ser Cortnay will be dead within </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the day. Melisandre has seen it in the flames of the future. His death and the manner of it. He </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">will not die in knightly combat, needless to say.” Stannis held out his cup, and Devan filled it </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">again from the flagon. “Her flames do not lie. She saw Renly’s doom as well. On </text>

<text top="945" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">have had me sail against Joffrey, but Melisandre told me that if I went to Storm’s End, I </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="458" height="15" font="1">would win the best part of my brother’s power, and she was right.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“B-but,” Davos stammered, “Lord Renly only came here because you had laid siege to </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the castle. He was marching toward King’s Landing before, against the Lannisters, he would </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stannis shifted in his seat, frowning. “<i>Was, would have</i>, what is that? He did what he did. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He came here with his banners and his peaches, to his doom . . . and it was well for me he did. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Melisandre saw another day in her flames as well. A morrow where Renly rode out of the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">south in his green armor to smash my host beneath the walls of King’s Landing. Had I met my </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="435" height="15" font="1">brother there, it might have been me who died in place of him.” </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Or you might have joined your strength to his to bring down the Lannisters,” Davos </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="541" height="15" font="1">protested. “Why not that? If she saw two futures, well . . . <i>both</i> cannot be true.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">King Stannis pointed a finger. “There you err, Onion Knight. Some lights cast more than </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">one shadow. Stand before the nightfire and you’ll see for yourself. The flames shift and </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dance, never still. The shadows grow tall and short, and every man casts a dozen. Some are </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fainter than others, that’s all. Well, men cast their shadows across the future as well. One </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">shadow or many, Melisandre sees them all.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You do not love the woman. I know that, Davos, I am not blind. My lords mislike her </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">too. Estermont thinks the flaming heart ill-chosen and begs to fight beneath the crowned stag </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as of old. Ser Guyard says a woman should not be my standard-bearer. Others whisper that </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she has no place in my war councils, that I ought to send her back to Asshai, that it is sinful to </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="489" height="15" font="1">keep her in my tent of a night. Aye, they whisper . . . while she serves.” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“Serves how?” Davos asked, dreading the answer. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“As needed.” The king looked at him. “And you?” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="592" height="15" font="1">“I . . .” Davos licked his lips. “I am yours to command. What would you have me do?” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Nothing you have not done before. Only land a boat beneath the castle, unseen, in the </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">black of night. Can you do that?” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="115" height="15" font="1">“Yes. Tonight?” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The king gave a curt nod. “You will need a small boat. Not <i>Black Betha</i>. No one must </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">know what you do.” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos wanted to protest. He was a knight now, no longer a smuggler, and he had never </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">been an assassin. Yet when he opened his mouth, the words would not come. This was </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Stannis</i>, his just lord, to whom he owed all he was. And he had his sons to consider as well. </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="287" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods be good, what has she done to him?</i> </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="239" height="15" font="1">“You are quiet,” Stannis observed. </text>
<text top="756" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>And should remain so</i>, Davos told himself, yet instead he said, “My liege, you must have </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the castle, I see that now, but surely there are other ways. <i>Cleaner</i> ways. Let Ser Cortnay keep </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">the bastard boy and he may well yield.” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="570" height="15" font="1">“I must have the boy, Davos. <i>Must.</i> Melisandre has seen that in the flames as well.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos groped for some other answer. “Storm’s End holds no knight who can match Ser </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Guyard or Lord Caron, or any of a hundred others sworn to your service. This single </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">combat . . . could it be that Ser Cortnay seeks for a way to yield with honor? Even if it means </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="1">his own life?” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A troubled look crossed the king’s face like a passing cloud. “More like he plans some </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">treachery. There will be no combat of champions. Ser Cortnay was dead before he ever threw </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="287" height="15" font="1">that glove. The flames do not lie, Davos.” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Yet they require me to make them true</i>, he thought. It had been a long time since Davos </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="145" height="15" font="1">Seaworth felt so sad. </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And so it was that he found himself once more crossing Shipbreaker Bay in the dark of </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">night, steering a tiny boat with a black sail. The sky was the same, and the sea. The same salt </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smell was in the air, and the water chuckling against the hull was just as he remembered it. A </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">thousand flickering campfires burned around the castle, as the fires of the Tyrells and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="448" height="15" font="1">Redwynes had sixteen years before. But all the rest was different. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>The last time it was life I brought to Storm’s End, shaped to look like onions. This time it </i></text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>is death, in the shape of Melisandre of Asshai.</i> Sixteen years ago, the sails had cracked and </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">snapped with every shift of wind, until he’d pulled them down and gone on with muffled oars. </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Even so, his heart had been in his gullet. The men on the Redwyne galleys had grown lax </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">after so long, however, and they had slipped through the cordon smooth as black satin. This </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">time, the only ships in sight belonged to Stannis, and the only danger would come from </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">watchers on the castle walls. Even so, Davos was taut as a bowstring. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Melisandre huddled upon a thwart, lost in the folds of a dark red cloak that covered her </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from head to heels, her face a paleness beneath the cowl. Davos loved the water. He slept best </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when he had a deck rocking beneath him, and the sighing of the wind in his rigging was a </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">sweeter sound to him than any a singer could make with his harp strings. Even the sea brought </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him no comfort tonight, though. “I can smell the fear on you, ser knight,” the red woman said </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">softly. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors. And tonight I am no knight. </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="499" height="15" font="1">Tonight I am Davos the smuggler again. Would that you were an onion.” </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="341" height="15" font="1">She laughed. “Is it me you fear? Or what we do?” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">“What <i>you</i> do. I’ll have no part of it.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="375" height="15" font="1">“Your hand raised the sail. Your hand holds the tiller.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Silent, Davos tended to his course. The shore was a snarl of rocks, so he was taking them </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">well out across the bay. He would wait for the tide to turn before coming about. Storm’s End </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dwindled behind them, but the red woman seemed unconcerned. “Are you a good man, Davos </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">Seaworth?” she asked. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Would a good man be doing this?</i> “I am a man,” he said. “I am kind to my wife, but I </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have known other women. I have tried to be a father to my sons, to help make them a place in </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">this world. Aye, I’ve broken laws, but I never felt evil until tonight. I would say my parts are </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">mixed, m’lady. Good <i>and</i> bad.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A grey man,” she said. “Neither white nor black, but partaking of both. Is that what you </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="118" height="15" font="1">are, Ser Davos?” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">“What if I am? It seems to me that most men are grey.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="588" height="15" font="1">“If half of an onion is black with rot, it is a rotten onion. A man is good, or he is evil.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The fires behind them had melted into one vague glow against the black sky, and the land </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was almost out of sight. It was time to come about. “Watch your head, my lady.” He pushed </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on the tiller, and the small boat threw up a curl of black water as she turned. Melisandre </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">leaned under the swinging yard, one hand on the gunwale, calm as ever. Wood creaked, </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">canvas cracked, and water splashed, so loudly a man might swear the castle was sure to hear. </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Davos knew better. The endless crash of wave on rock was the only sound that ever </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="507" height="15" font="1">penetrated the massive seaward walls of Storm’s End, and that but faintly. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A rippling wake spread out behind as they swung back toward the shore. “You speak of </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">men and onions,” Davos said to Melisandre. “What of women? Is it not the same for them? </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">Are you good or evil, my lady?” </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That made her chuckle. “Oh, good. I am a knight of sorts myself, sweet ser. A champion </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">of light and life.” </text>
<text top="1065" left="171" width="548" height="15" font="1">“Yet you mean to kill a man tonight,” he said. “As you killed Maester Cressen.” </text>
</page>
<page number="331" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Your maester poisoned himself. He meant to poison me, but I was protected by a greater </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">power and he was not.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="370" height="15" font="1">“And Renly Baratheon? Who was it who killed him?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Her head turned. Beneath the shadow of the cowl, her eyes burned like pale red candle </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">flames. “Not I.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="218" height="15" font="1">“Liar.” Davos was certain now. </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="549" height="15" font="1">Melisandre laughed again. “You are lost in darkness and confusion, Ser Davos.” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And a good thing.” Davos gestured at the distant lights flickering along the walls of </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Storm’s End. “Feel how cold the wind is? The guards will huddle close to those torches. A </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">little warmth, a little light, they’re a comfort on a night like this. Yet that will blind them, so </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">they will not see us pass.” <i>I hope.</i> “The god of darkness protects us now, my lady. Even you.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The flames of her eyes seemed to burn a little brighter at that. “Speak not that name, ser. </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lest you draw his black eye upon us. He protects no man, I promise you. He is the enemy of </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all that lives. It is the torches that hide us, you have said so yourself. Fire. The bright gift of </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">the Lord of Light.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="141" height="15" font="1">“Have it your way.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="127" height="15" font="1">“His way, rather.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The wind was shifting, Davos could feel it, see it in the way the black canvas rippled. He </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">reached for the halyards. “Help me bring in the sail. I’ll row us the rest of the way.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Together they tied off the sail as the boat rocked beneath them. As Davos unshipped the </text>
<text top="550" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">oars and slid them into the choppy black water, he said, “Who rowed you to Renly?” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There was no need,” she said. “He was unprotected. But here . . . this Storm’s End is an </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">old place. There are spells woven into the stones. Dark walls that no shadow can pass—</text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="252" height="15" font="1">ancient, forgotten, yet still in place.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="526" height="15" font="1">“Shadow?” Davos felt his flesh prickling. “A shadow is a thing of darkness.” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“You are more ignorant than a child, ser knight. There are no shadows in the dark. </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Shadows are the servants of light, the children of fire. The brightest flame casts the darkest </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">shadows.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Frowning, Davos hushed her then. They were coming close to shore once more, and </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">voices carried across the water. He rowed, the faint sound of his oars lost in the rhythm of the </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">waves. The seaward side of Storm’s End perched upon a pale white cliff, the chalky stone </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sloping up steeply to half again the height of the massive curtain wall. A mouth yawned in the </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cliff, and it was that Davos steered for, as he had sixteen years before. The tunnel opened on a </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">cavern under the castle, where the storm lords of old had built their landing. </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The passage was navigable only during high tide, and was never less than treacherous, </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but his smuggler’s skills had not deserted him. Davos threaded their way deftly between the </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">jagged rocks until the cave mouth loomed up before them. He let the waves carry them inside. </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">They crashed around him, slamming the boat this way and that and soaking them to the skin. </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">A half-seen finger of rock came rushing up out of the gloom, snarling foam, and Davos barely </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="1">kept them off it with an oar. </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="470" height="15" font="1">Then they were past, engulfed in darkness, and the waters smoothed. </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The little boat slowed and swirled. The sound of their breathing echoed until it seemed to </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">surround them. Davos had not expected the blackness. The last time, torches had burned all </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the ceiling. The portcullis was somewhere ahead, he knew. Davos used the oars to slow them, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">and they drifted against it almost gently. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“This is as far as we go, unless you have a man inside to lift the gate for us.” His </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="537" height="15" font="1">whispers scurried across the lapping water like a line of mice on soft pink feet. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“Have we passed within the walls?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes. Beneath. But we can go no farther. The portcullis goes all the way to the bottom. </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">And the bars are too closely spaced for even a child to squeeze through.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="594" height="15" font="1">There was no answer but a soft rustling. And then a light bloomed amidst the darkness. </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos raised a hand to shield his eyes, and his breath caught in his throat. Melisandre </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had thrown back her cowl and shrugged out of the smothering robe. Beneath, she was naked, </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and huge with child. Swollen breasts hung heavy against her chest, and her belly bulged as if </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">near to bursting. “<i>Gods preserve us</i>,” he whispered, and heard her answering laugh, deep and </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">throaty. Her eyes were hot coals, and the sweat that dappled her skin seemed to glow with a </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">light of its own. Melisandre <i>shone</i>. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Panting, she squatted and spread her legs. Blood ran down her thighs, black as ink. Her </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cry might have been agony or ecstasy or both. And Davos saw the crown of the child’s head </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">push its way out of her. Two arms wriggled free, grasping, black fingers coiling around </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Melisandre’s straining thighs, pushing, until the whole of the shadow slid out into the world </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and rose taller than Davos, tall as the tunnel, towering above the boat. He had only an instant </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to look at it before it was gone, twisting between the bars of the portcullis and racing across </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="396" height="15" font="1">the surface of the water, but that instant was long enough. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="393" height="15" font="1">He knew that shadow. As he knew the man who’d cast it. </text>

<text top="653" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The call came drifting through the black of night. Jon pushed himself onto an elbow, his </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand reaching for Longclaw by force of habit as the camp began to stir. <i>The horn that wakes </i></text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="5"><i>the sleepers</i>, he thought. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The long low note lingered at the edge of hearing. The sentries at the ringwall stood still </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in their footsteps, breath frosting and heads turned toward the west. As the sound of the horn </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">faded, even the wind ceased to blow. Men rolled from their blankets and reached for spears </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and swordbelts, moving quietly, listening. A horse whickered and was hushed. For a heartbeat </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">it seemed as if the whole forest were holding its breath. The brothers of the Night’s Watch </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="559" height="15" font="1">waited for a second blast, praying they should not hear it, fearing that they would. </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When the silence had stretched unbearably long and the men knew at last that the horn </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would not wind again, they grinned at one another sheepishly, as if to deny that they had been </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">anxious. Jon Snow fed a few sticks to the fire, buckled on his swordbelt, pulled on his boots, </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">shook the dirt and dew from the cloak, and fastened it around his shoulders. The flames </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blazed up beside him, welcome heat beating against his face as he dressed. He could hear the </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Lord Commander moving inside the tent. After a moment Mormont lifted the flap. “One </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="1">blast?” On his shoulder, his raven sat fluffed and silent, looking miserable. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">“One, my lord,” Jon agreed. “Brothers returning.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Mormont moved to the fire. “The Halfhand. And past time.” He had grown more restive </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">every day they waited; much longer and he would have been fit to whelp cubs. “See that </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="539" height="15" font="1">there’s hot food for the men and fodder for the horses. I’ll see Qhorin at once.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ll bring him, my lord.” The men from the Shadow Tower had been expected days ago. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">When they had not appeared, the brothers had begun to wonder. Jon had heard gloomy </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mutterings around the cookfire, and not just from Dolorous Edd. Ser Ottyn Wythers was for </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">retreating to Castle Black as soon as possible. Ser Mallador Locke would strike for the </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Shadow Tower, hoping to pick up Qhorin’s trail and learn what had befallen him. And Thoren </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Smallwood wanted to push on into the mountains. “Mance Rayder knows he must battle the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Watch,” Thoren had declared, “but he will never look for us so far north. If we ride up the </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Milkwater, we can take him unawares and cut his host to ribbons before he knows we are on </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">him.” </text>
<text top="285" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The numbers would be greatly against us,” Ser Ottyn had objected. “Craster said he was </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">gathering a great host. Many thousands. Without Qhorin, we are only two hundred.” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Send two hundred wolves against ten thousand sheep, ser, and see what happens,” said </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="1">Smallwood confidently. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“There are goats among these sheep, Thoren,” warned Jarman Buckwell. “Aye, and </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="517" height="15" font="1">maybe a few lions. Rattleshirt, Harma the Dogshead, Alfyn Crowkiller . . .” </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I know them as well as you do, Buckwell,” Thoren Smallwood snapped back. “And I </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mean to have their heads, every one. These are <i>wildlings</i>. No soldiers. A few hundred heroes, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">drunk most like, amidst a great horde of women, children, and thralls. We will sweep over </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">them and send them howling back to their hovels.” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They had argued for many hours, and reached no agreement. The Old Bear was too </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stubborn to retreat, but neither would he rush headlong up the Milkwater, seeking battle. In </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the end, nothing had been decided but to wait a few more days for the men from the Shadow </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="1">Tower, and talk again if they did not appear. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And now they had, which meant that the decision could be delayed no longer. Jon was </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="1">glad of that much, at least. If they must battle Mance Rayder, let it be soon. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He found Dolorous Edd at the fire, complaining about how difficult it was for him to </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sleep when people insisted on blowing horns in the woods. Jon gave him something new to </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">complain about. Together they woke Hake, who received the Lord Commander’s orders with </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a stream of curses, but got up all the same and soon had a dozen brothers cutting roots for a </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="40" height="15" font="1">soup. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sam came puffing up as Jon crossed the camp. Under the black hood his face was as pale </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="485" height="15" font="1">and round as the moon. “I heard the horn. Has your uncle come back?” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s only the men from the Shadow Tower.” It was growing harder to cling to the hope </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of Benjen Stark’s safe return. The cloak he had found beneath the Fist could well have </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">belonged to his uncle or one of his men, even the Old Bear admitted as much, though why </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they would have buried it there, wrapped around the cache of dragonglass, no one could say. </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">“Sam, I have to go.” </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">At the ringwall, he found the guards sliding spikes from the half-frozen earth to make an </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">opening. It was not long until the first of the brothers from the Shadow Tower began wending </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their way up the slope. All in leather and fur they were, with here and there a bit of steel or </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bronze; heavy beards covered hard lean faces, and made them look as shaggy as their garrons. </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Jon was surprised to see some of them were riding two to a horse. When he looked more </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">closely, it was plain that many of them were wounded. <i>There has been trouble on the way.</i> </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon knew Qhorin Halfhand the instant he saw him, though they had never met. The big </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ranger was half a legend in the Watch; a man of slow words and swift action, tall and straight </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as a spear, long-limbed and solemn. Unlike his men, he was clean-shaven. His hair fell from </text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">beneath his helm in a heavy braid touched with hoarfrost, and the blacks he wore were so </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">faded they might have been greys. Only thumb and forefinger remained on the hand that held </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">the reins; the other fingers had been sheared off catching a wildling’s axe that would </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">otherwise have split his skull. It was told that he had thrust his maimed fist into the face of the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">axeman so the blood spurted into his eyes, and slew him while he was blind. Since that day, </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="456" height="15" font="1">the wildlings beyond the Wall had known no foe more implacable. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon hailed him. “Lord Commander Mormont would see you at once. I’ll show you to his </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">tent.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Qhorin swung down from his saddle. “My men are hungry, and our horses require </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">tending.” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="166" height="15" font="1">“They’ll all be seen to.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The ranger gave his horse into the care of one of his men and followed. “You are Jon </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="254" height="15" font="1">Snow. You have your father’s look.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="216" height="15" font="1">“Did you know him, my lord?” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I am no lordling. Only a brother of the Night’s Watch. I knew Lord Eddard, yes. And </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="158" height="15" font="1">his father before him.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jon had to hurry his steps to keep up with Qhorin’s long strides. “Lord Rickard died </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">before I was born.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He was a friend to the Watch.” Qhorin glanced behind. “It is said that a direwolf runs </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">with you.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="357" height="15" font="1">“Ghost should be back by dawn. He hunts at night.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They found Dolorous Edd frying a rasher of bacon and boiling a dozen eggs in a kettle </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">over the Old Bear’s cookfire. Mormont sat in his wood-and-leather camp chair. “I had begun </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">to fear for you. Did you meet with trouble?” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We met with Alfyn Crowkiller. Mance had sent him to scout along the Wall, and we </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">chanced on him returning.” Qhorin removed his helm. “Alfyn will trouble the realm no </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">longer, but some of his company escaped us. We hunted down as many as we could, but it </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">may be that a few will win back to the mountains.” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="112" height="15" font="1">“And the cost?” </text>
<text top="723" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Four brothers dead. A dozen wounded. A third as many as the foe. And we took </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">captives. One died quickly from his wounds, but the other lived long enough to be </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="89" height="15" font="1">questioned.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Best talk of this inside. Jon will fetch you a horn of ale. Or would you prefer hot spiced </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">wine?” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="382" height="15" font="1">“Boiled water will suffice. An egg and a bite of bacon.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“As you wish.” Mormont lifted the flap of the tent and Qhorin Halfhand stooped and </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="117" height="15" font="1">stepped through. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Edd stood over the kettle swishing the eggs about with a spoon. “I envy those eggs,” he </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">said. “I could do with a bit of boiling about now. If the kettle were larger, I might jump in. </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Though I would sooner it were wine than water. There are worse ways to die than warm and </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drunk. I knew a brother drowned himself in wine once. It was a poor vintage, though, and his </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="1">corpse did not improve it.” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="162" height="15" font="1">“You <i>drank</i> the wine?” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“It’s an awful thing to find a brother dead. You’d have need of a drink as well, Lord </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="426" height="15" font="1">Snow.” Edd stirred the kettle and added a pinch more nutmeg. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Restless, Jon squatted by the fire and poked at it with a stick. He could hear the Old </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">quieter tones, but he could not make out the words. <i>Alfyn Crowkiller dead, that’s good.</i> He </text>

<text top="386" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“Might be we won’t give him one,” said Chett. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Just then one of the dogs had raised his head and growled, and he had to move away </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">quickly, before he was seen. <i>I was not meant to hear that</i>, he thought. He considered taking </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the tale to Mormont, but he could not bring himself to inform on his brothers, even brothers </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">such as Chett and the Sisterman. <i>It was just empty talk</i>, he told himself. <i>They are cold and </i></text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>afraid, we all are.</i> It was hard waiting here, perched on the stony summit above the forest, </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">wondering what the morrow might bring. <i>The unseen enemy is always the most fearsome.</i> </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon slid his new dagger from its sheath and studied the flames as they played against the </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">shiny black glass. He had fashioned the wooden hilt himself, and wound hempen twine </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">around it to make a grip. Ugly, but it served. Dolorous Edd opined that glass knives were </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">about as useful as nipples on a knight’s breastplate, but Jon was not so certain. The </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="437" height="15" font="1">dragonglass blade was sharper than steel, albeit far more brittle. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="263" height="15" font="5"><i>It must have been buried for a reason.</i> </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He had made a dagger for Grenn as well, and another for the Lord Commander. The </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warhorn he had given to Sam. On closer examination the horn had proved cracked, and even </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">after he had cleaned all the dirt out, Jon had been unable to get any sound from it. The rim </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was chipped as well, but Sam liked old things, even worthless old things. “Make a drinking </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">horn out of it,” Jon told him, “and every time you take a drink you’ll remember how you </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ranged beyond the Wall, all the way to the Fist of the First Men.” He gave Sam a spearhead </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">and a dozen arrowheads as well, and passed the rest out among his other friends for luck. </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Old Bear had seemed pleased by the dagger, but he preferred a steel knife at his belt, </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jon had noticed. Mormont could offer no answers as to who might have buried the cloak or </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">what it might mean. <i>Perhaps Qhorin will know.</i> The Halfhand had ventured deeper into the </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="217" height="15" font="1">wild than any other living man. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="219" height="15" font="1">“You want to serve, or shall I?” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="538" height="15" font="1">Jon sheathed the dagger. “I’ll do it.” He wanted to hear what they were saying. </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Edd cut three thick slices off a stale round of oat bread, stacked them on a wooden </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">platter, covered them with bacon and bacon drippings, and filled a bowl with hard-cooked </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">eggs. Jon took the bowl in one hand and the platter in the other and backed into the Lord </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">Commander’s tent. </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Qhorin was seated cross-legged on the floor, his spine as straight as a spear. Candlelight </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flickered against the hard flat planes of his cheeks as he spoke. “. . . Rattleshirt, the Weeping </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Man, and every other chief great and small,” he was saying. “They have wargs as well, and </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mammoths, and more strength than we would have dreamed. Or so he claimed. I will not </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">swear as to the truth of it. Ebben believes the man was telling us tales to make his life last a </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“True or false, the Wall must be warned,” the Old Bear said as Jon placed the platter </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">between them. “And the king.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="106" height="15" font="1">“Which king?” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“All of them. The true and the false alike. If they would claim the realm, let them defend </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="25" height="15" font="1">it.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Halfhand helped himself to an egg and cracked it on the edge of the bowl. “These </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">kings will do what they will,” he said, peeling away the shell. “Likely it will be little enough. </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">The best hope is Winterfell. The Starks must rally the north.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes. To be sure.” The Old Bear unrolled a map, frowned at it, tossed it aside, opened </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">another. He was pondering where the hammer would fall, Jon could see it. The Watch had </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">once manned seventeen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall, but they had been </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">abandoned one by one as the brotherhood dwindled. Only three were now garrisoned, a fact </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that Mance Rayder knew as well as they did. “Ser Alliser Thorne will bring back fresh levies </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from King’s Landing, we can hope. If we man Greyguard from the Shadow Tower and the </text>

<text top="488" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Greyguard has largely collapsed. Stonedoor would serve better, if the men could be </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">found. Icemark and Deep Lake as well, mayhaps. With daily patrols along the battlements </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="72" height="15" font="1">between.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“Patrols, aye. Twice a day, if we can. The Wall itself is a formidable obstacle. </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Undefended, it cannot stop them, yet it will delay them. The larger the host, the longer they’ll </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">require. From the emptiness they’ve left behind, they must mean to bring their women with </text>

<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">They will need to build a stair, or a great ramp . . . it will take a moon’s turn at the least, </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">perhaps longer. Mance will know his best chance is to pass <i>beneath</i> the Wall. Through a gate, </text>

<text top="695" left="171" width="85" height="15" font="1">“A breach.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="300" height="15" font="1">Mormont’s head came up sharply. “What?” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They do not plan to climb the Wall nor to burrow beneath it, my lord. They plan to </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">break it.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The Wall is seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that it would take a </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">hundred men a year to cut through it with picks and axes.” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="78" height="15" font="1">“Even so.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">Mormont plucked at his beard, frowning. “How?” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“How else? Sorcery.” Qhorin bit the egg in half. “Why else would Mance choose to </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gather his strength in the Frostfangs? Bleak and hard they are, and a long weary march from </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">the Wall.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="571" height="15" font="1">“I’d hoped he chose the mountains to hide his muster from the eyes of my rangers.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps,” said Qhorin, finishing the egg, “but there is more, I think. He is seeking </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">something in the high cold places. He is searching for something he needs.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Something?” Mormont’s raven lifted its head and screamed. The sound was sharp as a </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">knife in the closeness of the tent. </text>
</page>
<page number="337" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Some power. What it is, our captive could not say. He was questioned perhaps too </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="454" height="15" font="1">sharply, and died with much unsaid. I doubt he knew in any case.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jon could hear the wind outside. It made a high thin sound as it shivered through the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stones of the ringwall and tugged at the tent ropes. Mormont rubbed his mouth thoughtfully. </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">“Some power,” he repeated. “I must know.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“Then you must send scouts into the mountains.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="212" height="15" font="1">“I am loath to risk more men.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We can only die. Why else do we don these black cloaks, but to die in defense of the </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">realm? I would send fifteen men, in three parties of five. One to probe the Milkwater, one the </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Skirling Pass, one to climb the Giant’s Stair. Jarman Buckwell, Thoren Smallwood, and </text>

<text top="347" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“<i>Waits</i>,” the raven cried. “<i>Waits.</i>” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Lord Commander Mormont sighed deep in his chest. “I see no other choice,” he </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">conceded, “but if you do not return . . .” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Someone will come down out of the Frostfangs, my lord,” the ranger said. “If us, all </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">well and good. If not, it will be Mance Rayder, and you sit square in his path. He cannot </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">march south and leave you behind, to follow and harry his rear. He must attack. This is a </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">strong place.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="229" height="15" font="1">“Not that strong,” said Mormont. </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Belike we shall all die, then. Our dying will buy time for our brothers on the Wall. Time </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to garrison the empty castles and freeze shut the gates, time to summon lords and kings to </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="636" height="15" font="1">their aid, time to hone their axes and repair their catapults. Our lives will be coin well spent.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Die</i>,” the raven muttered, pacing along Mormont’s shoulders. “<i>Die, die, die, die.</i>” The </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">old Bear sat slumped and silent, as if the burden of speech had grown too heavy for him to </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="488" height="15" font="1">bear. But at last he said, “May the gods forgive me. Choose your men.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Qhorin Halfhand turned his head. His eyes met Jon’s, and held them for a long moment. </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">“Very well. I choose Jon Snow.” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Mormont blinked. “He is hardly more than a boy. And my steward besides. Not even a </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">ranger.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tollett can care for you as well, my lord.” Qhorin lifted his maimed, two-fingered hand. </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">“The old gods are still strong beyond the Wall. The gods of the First Men . . . and the Starks.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">Mormont looked at Jon. “What is your will in this?” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="172" height="15" font="1">“To go,” he said at once. </text>
<text top="837" left="171" width="346" height="15" font="1">The old man smiled sadly. “I thought it might be.” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Dawn had broken when Jon stepped from the tent beside Qhorin Halfhand. The wind </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">swirled around them, stirring their black cloaks and sending a scatter of red cinders flying </text>

<text top="926" left="171" width="480" height="15" font="1">“We ride at noon,” the ranger told him. “Best find that wolf of yours.” </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="230" height="15" font="1">“Is it the mob she fears? Or me?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="143" height="15" font="1">“Both,” said Lancel. </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Ah.” Tyrion had known nothing of this ploy. Had Varys’s little birds failed him for </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">once? Even spiders must nod, he supposed . . . or was the eunuch playing a deeper and more </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">subtle game than he knew? “You have my thanks, ser.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“Will you grant me the boon I asked of you?” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps.” Lancel wanted his own command in the next battle. A splendid way to die </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">before he finished growing that mustache, but young knights always think themselves </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">invincible. </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion lingered after his cousin had slipped away. At the Warrior’s altar, he used one </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">candle to light another. <i>Watch over my brother, you bloody bastard, he’s one of yours.</i> He lit a </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">second candle to the Stranger, for himself. </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">That night, when the Red Keep was dark, Bronn arrived to find him sealing a letter. </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">“Take this to Ser Jacelyn Bywater.” The dwarf dribbled hot golden wax down onto the </text>

<text top="480" left="171" width="514" height="15" font="1">“What does it say?” Bronn could not read, so he asked impudent questions. </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“That he’s to take fifty of his best swords and scout the roseroad.” Tyrion pressed his seal </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="122" height="15" font="1">into the soft wax. </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="333" height="15" font="1">“Stannis is more like to come up the kingsroad.” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Oh, I know. Tell Bywater to disregard what’s in the letter and take his men north. He’s </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">to lay a trap along the Rosby road. Lord Gyles will depart for his castle in a day or two, with a </text>

<text top="684" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No. I want him taken on to the castle.” Removing the boy from the city was one of his </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sister’s better notions, Tyrion had decided. At Rosby, Tommen would be safe from the mob, </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and keeping him apart from his brother also made things more difficult for Stannis; even if he </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">took King’s Landing and executed Joffrey, he’d still have a Lannister claimant to contend </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with. “Lord Gyles is too sickly to run and too craven to fight. He’ll command his castellan to </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">open the gates. Once inside the walls, Bywater is to expel the garrison and hold Tommen </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="424" height="15" font="1">there safe. Ask him how he likes the sound of <i>Lord</i> Bywater.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lord Bronn would sound better. I could grab the boy for you just as well. I’ll dandle </text>

<text top="929" left="139" width="181" height="15" font="1">to sell him to his enemies. </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“What should the new lord do with the old one?” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Whatever he pleases, so long as he remembers to feed him. I don’t want him dying.” </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Tyrion pushed away from the table. “My sister will send one of the Kingsguard with the </text>

<text top="1043" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bronn was not concerned. “The Hound is Joffrey’s dog, he won’t leave him. Ironhand’s </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If it comes to killing, tell Ser Jacelyn I won’t have it done in front of Tommen.” Tyrion </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="515" height="15" font="1">donned a heavy cloak of dark brown wool. “My nephew is tender-hearted.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="245" height="15" font="1">“Are you certain he’s a Lannister?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m certain of nothing but winter and battle,” he said. “Come. I’m riding with you part </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">of the way.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="95" height="15" font="1">“Chataya’s?” </text>

<text top="269" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They left through a postern gate in the north wall. Tyrion put his heels into his horse and </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">clattered down Shadowblack Lane. A few furtive shapes darted into alleys at the sound of </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hoofbeats on the cobbles, but no one dared accost them. The council had extended his curfew; </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">it was death to be taken on the streets after the evenfall bells had sung. The measure had </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">restored a degree of peace to King’s Landing and quartered the number of corpses found in </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the alleys of a morning, yet Varys said the people cursed him for it. <i>They should be thankful </i></text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>they have the breath to curse.</i> A pair of gold cloaks confronted them as they were making </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their way along Coppersmith’s Wynd, but when they realized whom they’d challenged they </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">begged the Hand’s pardons and waved them on. Bronn turned south for the Mud Gate and </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">they parted company. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion rode on toward Chataya’s, but suddenly his patience deserted him. He twisted in </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the saddle, scanning the street behind. There were no signs of followers. Every window was </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dark or tightly shuttered. He heard nothing but the wind swirling down the alleys. <i>If Cersei </i></text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>has someone stalking me tonight, he must be disguised as a rat.</i> “Bugger it all,” he muttered. </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He was sick of caution. Wheeling his horse around, he dug in his spurs. <i>If anyone’s after me, </i></text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>we’ll see how well they ride.</i> He flew through the moonlight streets, clattering over cobbles, </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="464" height="15" font="1">darting down narrow alleys and up twisty wynds, racing to his love. </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As he hammered on the gate he heard music wafting faintly over the spiked stone walls. </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">One of the Ibbenese ushered him inside. Tyrion gave the man his horse and said, “Who is </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that?” The diamond-shaped panes of the longhall windows shone with yellow light, and he </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="179" height="15" font="1">could hear a man singing. </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="290" height="15" font="1">The Ibbenese shrugged. “Fatbelly singer.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The sound swelled as he walked from the stable to the house. Tyrion had never been fond </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of singers, and he liked this one even less than the run of the breed, sight unseen. When he </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">pushed open the door, the man broke off. “My lord Hand.” He knelt, balding and kettle-</text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="295" height="15" font="1">bellied, murmuring, “An honor, an honor.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“M’lord.” Shae smiled at the sight of him. He liked that smile, the quick unthinking way </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">it came to her pretty face. The girl wore her purple silk, belted with a cloth-of-silver sash. The </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="427" height="15" font="1">colors favored her dark hair and the smooth cream of her skin. </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="320" height="15" font="1">“Sweetling,” he called her. “And who is this?” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The singer raised his eyes. “I am called Symon Silver Tongue, my lord. A player, a </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">singer, a taleteller—” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="529" height="15" font="1">“And a great fool,” Tyrion finished. “What did you call me, when I entered?” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Call? I only . . .” The silver in Symon’s tongue seemed to have turned to lead. “My lord </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">Hand, I said, an honor . . .” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A wiser man would have pretended not to recognize me. Not that I would have been </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fooled, but you ought to have tried. What am I to do with you now? You know of my sweet </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="495" height="15" font="1">Shae, you know where she dwells, you know that I visit by night alone.” </text>
<text top="1071" left="171" width="199" height="15" font="1">“I swear, I’ll tell no one . . .” </text>
</page>
<page number="340" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="515" height="15" font="1">“On that much we agree. Good night to you.” Tyrion led Shae up the stairs. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="607" height="15" font="1">“My singer may never sing again now,” she teased. “You’ve scared the voice from him.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="351" height="15" font="1">“A little fear will help him reach those high notes.” </text>
<text top="180" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She closed the door to their bedchamber. “You won’t hurt him, will you?” She lit a </text>
<text top="199" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">scented candle and knelt to pull off his boots. “His songs cheer me on the nights you don’t </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">come.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Would that I could come every night,” he said as she rubbed his bare feet. “How well </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">does he sing?” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“Better than some. Not so good as others.” </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion opened her robe and buried his face between her breasts. She always smelled </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">clean to him, even in this reeking sty of a city. “Keep him if you like, but keep him close. I </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="1">won’t have him wandering the city spreading tales in pot-shops.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="180" height="15" font="1">“He won’t—” she started. </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion covered her mouth with his own. He’d had talk enough; he needed the sweet </text>
<text top="422" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">simplicity of the pleasure he found between Shae’s thighs. Here, at least, he was welcome, </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">wanted. </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Afterward, he eased his arm out from under her head, slipped on his tunic, and went </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down to the garden. A half-moon silvered the leaves of the fruit trees and shone on the surface </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the stone bathing pond. Tyrion seated himself beside the water. Somewhere off to his right </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a cricket was chirping, a curiously homey sound. <i>It is peaceful here</i>, he thought, <i>but for how </i></text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="5"><i>long?</i> </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A whiff of something rank made him turn his head. Shae stood in the door behind him, </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dressed in the silvery robe he’d given her. <i>I loved a maid as white as winter, with moonglow </i></text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>in her hair.</i> Behind her stood one of the begging brothers, a portly man in filthy patched </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">robes, his bare feet crusty with dirt, a bowl hung about his neck on a leather thong where a </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">septon would have worn a crystal. The smell of him would have gagged a rat. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“Lord Varys has come to see you,” Shae announced. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The begging brother blinked at her, astonished. Tyrion laughed. “To be sure. How is it </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">you knew him when I did not?” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">She shrugged. “It’s still him. Only dressed different.” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A different look, a different smell, a different way of walking,” said Tyrion. “Most men </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">would be deceived.” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And most women, maybe. But not whores. A whore learns to see the man, not his garb, </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">or she turns up dead in an alley.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Varys looked pained, and not because of the false scabs on his feet. Tyrion chuckled. </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Shae, would you bring us some wine?” He might need a drink. Whatever brought the eunuch </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="335" height="15" font="1">here in the dead of night was not like to be good. </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I almost fear to tell you why I’ve come, my lord,” Varys said when Shae had left them. </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">“I bring dire tidings.” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You ought to dress in black feathers, Varys, you’re as bad an omen as any raven.” </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Awkwardly, Tyrion pushed to his feet, half afraid to ask the next question. “Is it Jaime?” <i>If </i></text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="5"><i>they have harmed him, nothing will save them.</i> </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No, my lord. A different matter. Ser Cortnay Penrose is dead. Storm’s End has opened </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="217" height="15" font="1">its gates to Stannis Baratheon.” </text>
</page>
<page number="341" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dismay drove all other thoughts from Tyrion’s mind. When Shae returned with the wine, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he took one sip and flung the cup away to explode against the side of the house. She raised a </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">hand to shield herself from the shards as the wine ran down the stones in long fingers, black in </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="1">the moonlight. “<i>Damn</i> him!” Tyrion said. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys smiled, showing a mouth full of rotted teeth. “Who, my lord? Ser Cortnay or Lord </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">Stannis?” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Both of them.” Storm’s End was strong, it should have been able to hold out for half a </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">year or more . . . time enough for his father to finish with Robb Stark. “How did this happen?” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Varys glanced at Shae. “My lord, must we trouble your sweet lady’s sleep with such grim </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">and bloody talk?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“A lady might be afraid,” said Shae, “but I’m not.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You should be,” Tyrion told her. “With Storm’s End fallen, Stannis will soon turn his </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">attention toward King’s Landing.” He regretted flinging away that wine now. “Lord Varys, </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">give us a moment, and I’ll ride back to the castle with you.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">“I shall wait in the stables.” He bowed and stomped off. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="418" height="15" font="1">Tyrion drew Shae down beside him. “You are not safe here.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="329" height="15" font="1">“I have my walls, and the guards you gave me.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sellswords,” Tyrion said. “They like my gold well enough, but will they die for it? As </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for these walls, a man could stand on another’s shoulders and be over in a heartbeat. A manse </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">much like this one was burned during the riots. They killed the goldsmith who owned it for </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the crime of having a full larder, just as they tore the High Septon to pieces, raped Lollys half </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a hundred times, and smashed Ser Aron’s skull in. What do you think they would do if they </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">got their hands on the Hand’s lady?” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The Hand’s whore, you mean?” She looked at him with those big bold eyes of hers. </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Though I would be your lady, m’lord. I’d dress in all the beautiful things you gave me, in </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">satin and samite and cloth-of-gold, and I’d wear your jewels and hold your hand and sit by </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">you at feasts. I could give you sons, I know I could . . . and I vow I’d never shame you.” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>My love for you shames me enough.</i> “A sweet dream, Shae. Now put it aside, I beg you. </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="116" height="15" font="1">It can never be.” </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“Because of the queen? I’m not afraid of her either.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="54" height="15" font="1">“I am.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="555" height="15" font="1">“Then <i>kill</i> her and be done with it. It’s not as if there was any love between you.” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion sighed. “She’s my sister. The man who kills his own blood is cursed forever in </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the sight of gods and men. Moreover, whatever you and I may think of Cersei, my father and </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brother hold her dear. I can scheme with any man in the Seven Kingdoms, but the gods have </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="364" height="15" font="1">not equipped me to face Jaime with swords in hand.” </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="518" height="15" font="1">“The Young Wolf and Lord Stannis have swords and they don’t scare you.” </text>
<text top="921" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>How little you know, sweetling.</i> “Against them I have all the power of House Lannister. </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">Against Jaime or my father, I have no more than a twisted back and a pair of stunted legs.” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You have me.” Shae kissed him, her arms sliding around his neck as she pressed her </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">body to his. </text>
<text top="1010" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The kiss aroused him, as her kisses always did, but this time Tyrion gently disentangled </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">himself. “Not now. Sweetling, I have . . . well, call it the seed of a plan. I think I might be able </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="267" height="15" font="1">Shae’s face went still. “The kitchens?” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="376" height="15" font="1">“Yes. If I act through Varys, no one will be the wiser.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She giggled. “M’lord, I’d poison you. Every man who’s tasted my cooking has told me </text>

<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The Red Keep has sufficient cooks. Butchers and bakers too. You’d need to pose as a </text>

<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A pot girl,” she said, “in scratchy brown rough-spun. Is that how m’lord wants to see </text>

<text top="288" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“M’lord wants to see you alive,” Tyrion said. “You can scarcely scour pots in silk and </text>

<text top="333" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Has m’lord grown tired of me?” She reached a hand under his tunic and found his cock. </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">In two quick strokes she had it hard. “<i>He</i> still wants me.” She laughed. “Would you like to </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fuck your kitchen wench, m’lord? You can dust me with flour and suck gravy off my titties if </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="1">you . . .” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Stop it.” The way she was acting reminded him of Dancy, who had tried so hard to win </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her wager. He yanked her hand away to keep her from further mischief. “This is not the time </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="323" height="15" font="1">for bed sport, Shae. Your life may be at stake.” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her grin was gone. “If I’ve displeased m’lord, I never meant it, only . . . couldn’t you just </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">give me more guards?” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion breathed a deep sigh. <i>Remember how young she is</i>, he told himself. He took her </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand. “Your gems can be replaced, and new gowns can be sewn twice as lovely as the old. To </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">me, you’re the most precious thing within these walls. The Red Keep is not safe either, but </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="1">it’s a deal safer than here. I want you there.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="372" height="15" font="1">“In the kitchens.” Her voice was flat. “Scouring pots.” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="139" height="15" font="1">“For a short while.” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My father made me his kitchen wench,” she said, her mouth twisting. “That was why I </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">ran off.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="584" height="15" font="1">“You told me you ran off because your father made you his whore,” he reminded her. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That too. I didn’t like scouring his pots no more than I liked his cock in me.” She tossed </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="636" height="15" font="1">her head. “Why can’t you keep me in your tower? Half the lords at court keep bed-warmers.” </text>
<text top="773" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">“I was expressly forbidden to take you to court.” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“By your stupid father.” Shae pouted. “You’re old enough to keep all the whores you </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="520" height="15" font="1">want. Does he take you for a beardless boy? What could he do, spank you?” </text>
<text top="843" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He slapped her. Not hard, but hard enough. “Damn you,” he said. “<i>Damn you. Never</i> </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">mock me. Not <i>you</i>.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">For a moment Shae did not speak. The only sound was the cricket, chirping, chirping. </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">“Beg pardon, m’lord,” she said at last, in a heavy wooden voice. “I never meant to be </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">impudent.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="5"><i>And I never meant to strike you. Gods be good, am I turning into Cersei?</i> “That was ill-</text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">done,” he said. “On both our parts. Shae, you do not understand.” Words he had never meant </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to speak came tumbling out of him like mummers from a hollow horse. “When I was thirteen, </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">I wed a crofter’s daughter. Or so I thought her. I was blind with love for her, and thought she </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">felt the same for me, but my father rubbed my face in the truth. My bride was a whore Jaime </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had hired to give me my first taste of manhood.” <i>And I believed all of it, fool that I was.</i> “To </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">drive the lesson home, Lord Tywin gave my wife to a barracks of his guardsmen to use as </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they pleased, and commanded me to watch.” <i>And to take her one last time, after the rest were </i></text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>done. One last time, with no trace of love or tenderness remaining.</i> “<i>So you will remember her </i></text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>as she truly is</i>,” <i>he said, and I should have defied him, but my cock betrayed me, and I did as I </i></text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>was bid.</i> “After he was done with her, my father had the marriage undone. It was as if we had </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">never been wed, the septons said.” He squeezed her hand. “Please, let’s have no more talk of </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Tower of the Hand. You will be in the kitchens only a little while. Once we’re done with </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">Stannis, you’ll have another manse, and silks as soft as your hands.” </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Shae’s eyes had grown large but he could not read what lay behind them. “My hands </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">won’t be soft if I clean ovens and scrape plates all day. Will you still want them touching you </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">when they’re all red and raw and cracked from hot water and lye soap?” </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“More than ever,” he said. “When I look at them, they’ll remind me how brave you </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">were.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He could not say if she believed him. She lowered her eyes. “I am yours to command, </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">m’lord.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was as much acceptance as she could give tonight, he saw that plain enough. He kissed </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">her cheek where he’d struck her, to take some sting from the blow. “I will send for you.” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys was waiting in the stables, as promised. His horse looked spavined and half-dead. </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tyrion mounted up; one of the sellswords opened the gates. They rode out in silence. <i>Why did </i></text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>I tell her about Tysha, gods help me?</i> he asked himself, suddenly afraid. There were some </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">secrets that should never be spoken, some shames a man should take to his grave. What did he </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">want from her, forgiveness? The way she had looked at him, what did that mean? Did she hate </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the thought of scouring pots that much, or was it his confession? <i>How could I tell her that and </i></text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>still think she would love me?</i> part of him said, and another part mocked, saying, <i>Fool of a </i></text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="361" height="15" font="5"><i>dwarf, it is only the gold and jewels the whore loves.</i> </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">His scarred elbow was throbbing, jarred every time the horse set down a hoof. </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Sometimes he could almost fancy he heard the bones grinding together inside. Perhaps he </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">should see a maester, get some potion for the pain . . . but since Pycelle had revealed himself </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">for what he was, Tyrion Lannister mistrusted the maesters. The gods only knew who they </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were conspiring with, or what they had mixed in those potions they gave you. “Varys,” he </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">said. “I need to bring Shae into the castle without Cersei becoming aware.” Briefly, he </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">sketched out his kitchen scheme. </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">When he was done, the eunuch made a little clucking sound. “I will do as my lord </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">commands, of course . . . but I must warn you, the kitchens are full of eyes and ears. Even if </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the girl falls under no particular suspicion, she will be subject to a thousand questions. Where </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was she born? Who were her parents? How did she come to King’s Landing? The truth will </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">never do, so she must lie . . . and lie, and lie.” He glanced down at Tyrion. “And such a pretty </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">young kitchen wench will incite lust as well as curiosity. She will be touched, pinched, patted, </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and fondled. Pot boys will crawl under her blankets of a night. Some lonely cook may seek to </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">wed her. Bakers will knead her breasts with floured hands.” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">“I’d sooner have her fondled than stabbed,” said Tyrion. </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys rode on a few paces and said, “It might be that there is another way. As it happens, </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the maidservant who attends Lady Tanda’s daughter has been filching her jewels. Were I to </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">inform Lady Tanda, she would be forced to dismiss the girl at once. And the daughter would </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="195" height="15" font="1">require a new maidservant.” </text>
<text top="1017" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I see.” This had possibilities, Tyrion saw at once. A lady’s bedmaid wore finer garb than </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a scullion, and often even a jewel or two. Shae should be pleased by that. And Cersei thought </text>
</page>
<page number="344" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lady Tanda tedious and hysterical, and Lollys a bovine lackwit. She was not like to pay them </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="126" height="15" font="1">any friendly calls. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lollys is timid and trusting,” Varys said. “She will accept any tale she is told. Since the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">mob took her maidenhood she is afraid to leave her chambers, so Shae will be out of </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="463" height="15" font="1">sight . . . but conveniently close, should you have need of comfort.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The Tower of the Hand is watched, you know as well as I. Cersei would be certain to </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="402" height="15" font="1">grow curious if Lollys’s bedmaid started paying me calls.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I might be able to slip the child into your bedchamber unseen. Chataya’s is not the only </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">house to boast a hidden door.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A secret access? To <i>my</i> chambers?” Tyrion was more annoyed than surprised. Why else </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would Maegor the Cruel have ordered death for all the builders who had worked on his castle, </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">except to preserve such secrets? “Yes, I suppose there would be. Where will I find the door? </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">In my solar? My bedchamber?” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="542" height="15" font="1">“My friend, you would not force me to reveal <i>all</i> my little secrets, would you?” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Henceforth think of them as <i>our</i> little secrets, Varys.” Tyrion glanced up at the eunuch </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="455" height="15" font="1">in his smelly mummer’s garb. “Assuming you <i>are</i> on my side . . .” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="140" height="15" font="1">“Can you doubt it?” </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Why no, I trust you implicitly.” A bitter laugh echoed off the shuttered windows. “I </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="588" height="15" font="1">trust you like one of my own blood, in truth. Now tell me how Cortnay Penrose died.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="320" height="15" font="1">“It is said that he threw himself from a tower.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="309" height="15" font="1">“Threw <i>himself?</i> No, I will not believe that!” </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="580" height="15" font="1">“His guards saw no man enter his chambers, nor did they find any within afterward.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then the killer entered earlier and hid under the bed,” Tyrion suggested, “or he climbed </text>
<text top="620" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down from the roof on a rope. Perhaps the guards are lying. Who’s to say they did not do the </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">thing themselves?” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“Doubtless you are right, my lord.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="558" height="15" font="1">His smug tone said otherwise. “But you do not think so? How was it done, then?” </text>
<text top="715" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">For a long moment Varys said nothing. The only sound was the stately <i>clack</i> of </text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horseshoes on cobbles. Finally the eunuch cleared his throat. “My lord, do you believe in the </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">old powers?” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Magic, you mean?” Tyrion said impatiently. “Bloodspells, curses, shapeshifting, those </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sorts of things?” He snorted. “Do you mean to suggest that Ser Cortnay was magicked to his </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">death?” </text>
<text top="843" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ser Cortnay had challenged Lord Stannis to single combat on the morning he died. I ask </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">you, is this the act of a man lost to despair? Then there is the matter of Lord Renly’s </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mysterious and most fortuitous murder, even as his battle lines were forming up to sweep his </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brother from the field.” The eunuch paused a moment. “My lord, you once asked me how it </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">was that I was cut.” </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="378" height="15" font="1">“I recall,” said Tyrion. “You did not want to talk of it.” </text>
<text top="971" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Nor do I, but . . .” This pause was longer than the one before, and when Varys spoke </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">again his voice was different somehow. “I was an orphan boy apprenticed to a traveling folly. </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Our master owned a fat little cog and we sailed up and down the narrow sea performing in all </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">the Free Cities and from time to time in Oldtown and King’s Landing.” </text>
</page>
<page number="345" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“One day at Myr, a certain man came to our folly. After the performance, he made an </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">offer for me that my master found too tempting to refuse. I was in terror. I feared the man </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">meant to use me as I had heard men used small boys, but in truth the only part of me he had </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">need of was my manhood. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">did nothing to dull my senses. With a long hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all the while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames turned blue, and I </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">heard a voice answer his call, though I did not understand the words they spoke.” </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The mummers had sailed by the time he was done with me. Once I had served his </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">purpose, the man had no further interest in me, so he put me out. When I asked him what I </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">should do now, he answered that he supposed I should die. To spite him, I resolved to live. I </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">begged, I stole, and I sold what parts of my body still remained to me. Soon I was as good a </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thief as any in Myr, and when I was older I learned that often the contents of a man’s letters </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="1">are more valuable than the contents of his purse.” </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Yet I still dream of that night, my lord. Not of the sorcerer, nor his blade, nor even the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">way my manhood shriveled as it burned. I dream of the voice. The voice from the flames. </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Was it a god, a demon, some conjurer’s trick? I could not tell you, and I know all the tricks. </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">All I can say for a certainty is that he called it, and it answered, and since that day I have </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hated magic and all those who practice it. If Lord Stannis is one such, I mean to see him </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">dead.” </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When he was done, they rode in silence for a time. Finally Tyrion said, “A harrowing </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">tale. I’m sorry.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The eunuch sighed. “You are sorry, but you do not believe me. No, my lord, no need to </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">apologize. I was drugged and in pain and it was a very long time ago and far across the sea. </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">No doubt I dreamed that voice. I’ve told myself as much a thousand times.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I believe in steel swords, gold coins, and men’s wits,” said Tyrion. “And I believe there </text>

<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“On that we agree.” Tyrion smiled. “And for Ser Cortnay’s death, well, we know Stannis </text>

<text top="441" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I mean to give him better reason than mere birth.” He wheeled his warhorse about and </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">raised a hand. Trumpets sounded, a drum began to boom, the drawbridge descended in fits </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and starts, and Ser Edmure Tully led his men out from Riverrun with lances raised and </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">banners streaming. </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>I have a greater host than yours, brother</i>, Catelyn thought as she watched them go. <i>A </i></text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="5"><i>host of doubts and fears.</i> </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beside her, Brienne’s misery was almost palpable. Catelyn had ordered garments sewn to </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her measure, handsome gowns to suit her birth and sex, yet still she preferred to dress in </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">oddments of mail and boiled leather, a swordbelt cinched around her waist. She would have </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">been happier riding to war with Edmure, no doubt, but even walls as strong as Riverrun’s </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">required swords to hold them. Her brother had taken every able-bodied man for the fords, </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">leaving Ser Desmond Grell to command a garrison made up of the wounded, the old, and the </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sick, along with a few squires and some untrained peasant boys still shy of manhood. This, to </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">defend a castle crammed full of women and children. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the last of Edmure’s foot had shuffled under the portcullis, Brienne asked, “What </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">shall we do now, my lady?” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Our duty.” Catelyn’s face was drawn as she started across the yard. <i>I have always done </i></text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>my duty</i>, she thought. Perhaps that was why her lord father had always cherished her best of </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all his children. Her two older brothers had both died in infancy, so she had been son as well </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as daughter to Lord Hoster until Edmure was born. Then her mother had died and her father </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had told her that she must be the lady of Riverrun now, and she had done that too. And when </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lord Hoster promised her to Brandon Stark, she had thanked him for making her such a </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">splendid match. </text>
<text top="918" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>I gave Brandon my favor to wear, and never comforted Petyr once after he was wounded, </i></text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>nor bid him farewell when Father sent him off. And when Brandon was murdered and Father </i></text>

<text top="1040" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gardens and filled with rainbow light. It was crowded when they entered; Catelyn was not </text>

<text top="207" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Edmure’s age. He performed his office well enough, and his voice was rich and pleasant when </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he sang the praises to the Seven, but Catelyn found herself yearning for the thin quavering </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tones of Septon Osmynd, long dead. Osmynd would have listened patiently to the tale of what </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she had seen and felt in Renly’s pavilion, and he might have known what it meant as well, and </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">what she must do to lay to rest the shadows that stalked her dreams. <i>Osmynd, my father, </i></text>

<text top="369" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Catelyn’s knees were stiff by the time she rose, though she felt no wiser. Perhaps she </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would go to the godswood tonight, and pray to Ned’s gods as well. They were older than the </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">Seven. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Outside, she found song of a very different sort. Rymund the Rhymer sat by the </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brewhouse amidst a circle of listeners, his deep voice ringing as he sang of Lord Deremond at </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">the Bloody Meadow. </text>
<text top="497" left="326" width="271" height="15" font="5"><i>And there he stood with sword in hand, </i></text>
<text top="522" left="372" width="179" height="15" font="5"><i>the last of Darry’s ten . . .</i> </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Brienne paused to listen for a moment, broad shoulders hunched and thick arms crossed </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">against her chest. A mob of ragged boys raced by, screeching and flailing at each other with </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">sticks. <i>Why do boys so love to play at war?</i> Catelyn wondered if Rymund was the answer. The </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">singer’s voice swelled as he neared the end of his song. </text>
<text top="630" left="342" width="239" height="15" font="5"><i>And red the grass beneath his feet, </i></text>
<text top="650" left="367" width="189" height="15" font="5"><i>and red his banners bright, </i></text>
<text top="669" left="342" width="238" height="15" font="5"><i>and red the glow of the setting sun </i></text>
<text top="689" left="367" width="188" height="15" font="5"><i>that bathed him in its light. </i></text>
<text top="708" left="311" width="301" height="15" font="5"><i>“Come on, come on,” the great lord called, </i></text>
<text top="734" left="366" width="190" height="15" font="5"><i>“my sword is hungry still.” </i></text>
<text top="753" left="355" width="212" height="15" font="5"><i>And with a cry of savage rage, </i></text>
<text top="773" left="348" width="226" height="15" font="5"><i>They swarmed across the rill . . .</i> </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Fighting is better than this waiting,” Brienne said. “You don’t feel so helpless when you </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fight. You have a sword and a horse, sometimes an axe. When you’re armored it’s hard for </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">anyone to hurt you.” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="317" height="15" font="1">“Knights die in battle,” Catelyn reminded her. </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Brienne looked at her with those blue and beautiful eyes. “As ladies die in childbed. No </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">one sings songs about <i>them</i>.” </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Children are a battle of a different sort.” Catelyn started across the yard. “A battle </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">without banners or warhorns, but no less fierce. Carrying a child, bringing it into the </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="393" height="15" font="1">world . . . your mother will have told you of the pain . . .” </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I never knew my mother,” Brienne said. “My father had ladies . . . a different lady every </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="96" height="15" font="1">year, but . . .” </text>
</page>
<page number="348" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Those were no ladies,” Catelyn said. “As hard as birth can be, Brienne, what comes </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">after is even harder. At times I feel as though I am being torn apart. Would that there were </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="420" height="15" font="1">five of me, one for each child, so I might keep them all safe.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="296" height="15" font="1">“And who would keep <i>you</i> safe, my lady?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her smile was wan and tired. “Why, the men of my House. Or so my lady mother taught </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">me. My lord father, my brother, my uncle, my husband, they will keep me safe . . . but while </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">they are away from me, I suppose you must fill their place, Brienne.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">Brienne bowed her head. “I shall try, my lady.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Later that day, Maester Vyman brought a letter. She saw him at once, hoping for some </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">word from Robb, or from Ser Rodrik in Winterfell, but the message proved to be from one </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lord Meadows, who named himself castellan of Storm’s End. It was addressed to her father, </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her brother, her son, “or whoever now holds Riverrun.” Ser Cortnay Penrose was dead, the </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">man wrote, and Storm’s End had opened its gate to Stannis Baratheon, the trueborn and </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rightful heir. The castle garrison had sworn their swords to his cause, one and all, and no man </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">of them had suffered harm. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Save Cortnay Penrose,” Catelyn murmured. She had never met the man, yet she grieved </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to hear of his passing. “Robb should know of this at once,” she said. “Do we know where he </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="31" height="15" font="1">is?” </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“At last word he was marching toward the Crag, the seat of House Westerling,” said </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Maester Vyman. “If I dispatched a raven to Ashemark, it may be that they could send a rider </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">after him.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="63" height="15" font="1">“Do so.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn read the letter again after the maester was gone. “Lord Meadows says nothing of </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Robert’s bastard,” she confided to Brienne. “I suppose he yielded the boy with the rest, </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">though I confess, I do not understand why Stannis wanted him so badly.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="243" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps he fears the boy’s claim.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="543" height="15" font="1">“A bastard’s claim? No, it’s something else . . . what does this child look like?” </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He is seven or eight, comely, with black hair and bright blue eyes. Visitors oft thought </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">him Lord Renly’s own son.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“And Renly favored Robert.” Catelyn had a glimmer of understanding. “Stannis means to </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">parade his brother’s bastard before the realm, so men might see Robert in his face and wonder </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">why there is no such likeness in Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="205" height="15" font="1">“Would that mean so much?” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Those who favor Stannis will call it proof. Those who support Joffrey will say it means </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nothing.” Her own children had more Tully about them than Stark. Arya was the only one to </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">show much of Ned in her features. <i>And Jon Snow, but he was never mine.</i> She found herself </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">thinking of Jon’s mother, that shadowy secret love her husband would never speak of. <i>Does </i></text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>she grieve for Ned as I do? Or did she hate him for leaving her bed for mine? Does she pray </i></text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="265" height="15" font="5"><i>for her son as I have prayed for mine?</i> </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They were uncomfortable thoughts, and futile. If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Starfall, as some whispered, the lady was long dead; if not, Catelyn had no clue who or where </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his mother might be. And it made no matter. Ned was gone now, and his loves and his secrets </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">had all died with him. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Still, she was struck again by how strangely men behaved when it came to their bastards. </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ned had always been fiercely protective of Jon, and Ser Cortnay Penrose had given up his life </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for this Edric Storm, yet Roose Bolton’s bastard had meant less to him than one of his dogs, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to judge from the tone of the queer cold letter Edmure had gotten from him not three days </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">past. He had crossed the Trident and was marching on Harrenhal as commanded, he wrote. “A </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">strong castle, and well garrisoned, but His Grace shall have it, if I must kill every living soul </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">within to make it so.” He hoped His Grace would weigh that against the crimes of his bastard </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">son, whom Ser Rodrik Cassel had put to death. “A fate he no doubt earned,” Bolton had </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">written. “Tainted blood is ever treacherous, and Ramsay’s nature was sly, greedy, and cruel. I </text>

<text top="240" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">have been safe while he lived.” </text>
<text top="265" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">The sound of hurrying footsteps drove the morbid thoughts from her head. Ser </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Desmond’s squire dashed panting into the room and knelt. “My lady . . . Lannisters . . . across </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">the river.” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="301" height="15" font="1">“Take a long breath, lad, and tell it slowly.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He did as she bid him. “A column of armored men,” he reported. “Across the Red Fork. </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">They are flying a purple unicorn below the lion of Lannister.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Some son of Lord Brax.</i> Brax had come to Riverrun once when she was a girl, to propose </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wedding one of his sons to her or Lysa. She wondered whether it was this same son out there </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">now, leading the attack. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Lannisters had ridden out of the southeast beneath a blaze of banners, Ser Desmond </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">told her when she ascended to the battlements to join him. “A few outriders, no more,” he </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">assured her. “The main strength of Lord Tywin’s host is well to the south. We are in no </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">danger here.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">South of the Red Fork the land stretched away open and flat. From the watchtower </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could see for miles. Even so, only the nearest ford was visible. Edmure had entrusted </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lord Jason Mallister with its defense, as well as that of three others farther upriver. The </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Lannister riders were milling about uncertainly near the water, crimson and silver banners </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">flapping in the wind. “No more than fifty, my lady,” Ser Desmond estimated. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn watched the riders spread out in a long line. Lord Jason’s men waited to receive </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">them behind rocks and grass and hillocks. A trumpet blast sent the horsemen forward at a </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ponderous walk, splashing down into the current. For a moment they made a brave show, all </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="561" height="15" font="1">bright armor and streaming banners, the sun flashing off the points of their lances. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="234" height="15" font="1">“<i>Now</i>,” she heard Brienne mutter. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was hard to make out what was happening, but the screams of the horses seemed loud </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">even at this remove, and beneath them Catelyn heard the fainter clash of steel on steel. A </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">banner vanished suddenly as its bearer was swept under, and soon after the first dead man </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drifted past their walls, borne along by the current. By then the Lannisters had pulled back in </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">confusion. She watched as they re-formed, conferred briefly, and galloped back the way they </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had come. The men on the walls shouted taunts after them, though they were already too far </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="79" height="15" font="1">off to hear. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Desmond slapped his belly. “Would that Lord Hoster could have seen that. It would </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">have made him dance.” </text>
<text top="945" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My father’s dancing days are past, I fear,” Catelyn said, “and this fight is just begun. </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="541" height="15" font="1">The Lannisters will come again. Lord Tywin has twice my brother’s numbers.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He could have ten times and it would not matter,” Ser Desmond said. “The west bank of </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the Red Fork is higher than the east, my lady, and well wooded. Our bowmen have good </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cover, and a clear field for their shafts . . . and should any breach occur, Edmure will have his </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">best knights in reserve, ready to ride wherever they are most sorely needed. The river will </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">hold them.” </text>
</page>
<page number="350" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="332" height="15" font="1">“I pray that you are right,” Catelyn said gravely. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That night they came again. She had commanded them to wake her at once if the enemy </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">returned, and well after midnight a serving girl touched her gently by the shoulder. Catelyn sat </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">up at once. “What is it?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="187" height="15" font="1">“The ford again, my lady.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Wrapped in a bed-robe, Catelyn climbed to the roof of the keep. From there she could see </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">over the walls and the moonlit river to where the battle raged. The defenders had built </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">watchfires along the bank, and perhaps the Lannisters thought to find them night-blind or </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">unwary. If so, it was folly. Darkness was a chancy ally at best. As they waded in to breast </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">their way across, men stepped in hidden pools and went down splashing, while others </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stumbled over stones or gashed their feet on the hidden caltrops. The Mallister bowmen sent a </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">storm of fire arrows hissing across the river, strangely beautiful from afar. One man, pierced </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through a dozen times, his clothes afire, danced and whirled in the knee-deep water until at </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">last he fell and was swept downstream. By the time his body came bobbing past Riverrun, the </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="308" height="15" font="1">fires and his life had both been extinguished. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>A small victory</i>, Catelyn thought when the fighting had ended and the surviving foemen </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had melted back into the night, <i>yet a victory nonetheless.</i> As they descended the winding </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">turret steps, Catelyn asked Brienne for her thoughts. “That was the brush of Lord Tywin’s </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fingertip, my lady,” the girl said. “He is probing, feeling for a weak point, an undefended </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crossing. If he does not find one, he will curl all his fingers into a fist and try and make one.” </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Brienne hunched her shoulders. “That’s what I’d do. Were I him.” Her hand went to the hilt </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="502" height="15" font="1">of her sword and gave it a little pat, as if to make certain it was still there. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>And may the gods help us then</i>, Catelyn thought. Yet there was nothing she could do for </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="1">it. That was Edmure’s battle out there on the river; hers was here inside the castle. </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The next morning as she broke her fast, she sent for her father’s aged steward, Utherydes </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Wayn. “Have Ser Cleos Frey brought a flagon of wine. I mean to question him soon, and I </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">want his tongue well loosened.” </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“As you command, my lady.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Not long after, a rider with the Mallister eagle sewn on his breast arrived with a message </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from Lord Jason, telling of another skirmish and another victory. Ser Flement Brax had tried </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">to force a crossing at a different ford six leagues to the south. This time the Lannisters </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shortened their lances and advanced across the river behind on foot, but the Mallister bowmen </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">had rained high arcing shots down over their shields, while the scorpions Edmure had </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">mounted on the riverbank sent heavy stones crashing through to break up the formation. </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“They left a dozen dead in the water, only two reaching the shallows, where we dealt with </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them briskly,” the rider reported. He also told of fighting farther upstream, where Lord Karyl </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">Vance held the fords. “Those thrusts too were turned aside, at grievous cost to our foes.” </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Perhaps Edmure was wiser than I knew</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>His lords all saw the sense in </i></text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>his battle plans, why was I so blind? My brother is not the little boy I remember, no more than </i></text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="5"><i>Robb is.</i> </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She waited until evening before going to pay her call upon Ser Cleos Frey, reasoning that </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the longer she delayed, the drunker he was likely to be. As she entered the tower cell, Ser </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Cleos stumbled to his knees. “My lady, I knew naught of any escape. The Imp said a </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="496" height="15" font="1">Lannister must needs have a Lannister escort, on my oath as a knight—” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Arise, ser.” Catelyn seated herself. “I know no grandson of Walder Frey would be an </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="1">oathbreaker.” <i>Unless it served his purpose.</i> “You brought peace terms, my brother said.” </text>
<text top="1068" left="171" width="566" height="15" font="1">“I did.” Ser Cleos lurched to his feet. She was pleased to see how unsteady he was. </text>
</page>
<page number="351" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“Tell me,” she commanded, and he did. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When he was done, Catelyn sat frowning. Edmure had been right, these were no terms at </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="500" height="15" font="1">all, except . . . “Lannister will exchange Arya and Sansa for his brother?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="320" height="15" font="1">“Yes. He sat on the Iron Throne and swore it.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="142" height="15" font="1">“Before witnesses?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Before all the court, my lady. And the gods as well. I said as much to Ser Edmure, but </text>
<text top="243" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="1">he told me it was not possible, that His Grace Robb would never consent.” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He told you true.” She could not even say that Robb was wrong. Arya and Sansa were </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">children. The Kingslayer, alive and free, was as dangerous as any man in the realm. That road </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="414" height="15" font="1">led nowhere. “Did you see my girls? Are they treated well?” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos hesitated. “I . . . yes, they seemed . . .” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He is fumbling for a lie</i>, Catelyn realized, <i>but the wine has fuddled his wits.</i> “Ser Cleos,” </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she said coolly, “you forfeited the protection of your peace banner when your men played us </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">false. Lie to me, and you’ll hang from the walls beside them. Believe that. I shall ask you </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="280" height="15" font="1">once more—<i>did you see my daughters?</i>” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His brow was damp with sweat. “I saw Sansa at the court, the day Tyrion told me his </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">terms. She looked most beautiful, my lady. Perhaps a, a bit wan. Drawn, as it were.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Sansa, but not Arya.</i> That might mean anything. Arya had always been harder to tame. </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Perhaps Cersei was reluctant to parade her in open court for fear of what she might say or do. </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">They might have her locked safely out of sight. <i>Or they might have killed her.</i> Catelyn shoved </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">the thought away. “<i>His</i> terms, you said . . . yet Cersei is Queen Regent.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tyrion spoke for both of them. The queen was not there. She was indisposed that day, I </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">was told.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Curious.” Catelyn thought back to that terrible trek through the Mountains of the Moon, </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and the way Tyrion Lannister had somehow seduced that sellsword from her service to his </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">own.  <i>The dwarf is too clever by half.</i> She could not imagine how he had survived the high </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">road after Lysa had sent him from the Vale, yet it did not surprise her. <i>He had no part in </i></text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Ned’s murder, at the least. And he came to my defense when the clansmen attacked us. If I </i></text>
<text top="712" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="5"><i>could trust his word . . .</i> </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">She opened her hands to look down at the scars across her fingers. <i>His dagger’s marks</i>, </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">she reminded herself. <i>His dagger, in the hand of the killer he paid to open Bran’s throat.</i> </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Though the dwarf denied it, to be sure. Even after Lysa locked him in one of her sky cells and </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">threatened him with her moon door, he had still denied it. “He lied,” she said, rising abruptly. </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“The Lannisters are liars every one, and the dwarf is the worst of them. The killer was armed </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">with his own knife.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="305" height="15" font="1">Ser Cleos stared. “I know nothing of any—” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You know nothing,” she agreed, sweeping from the cell. Brienne fell in beside her, </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silent. <i>It is simpler for her</i>, Catelyn thought with a pang of envy. She was like a man in that. </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">For men the answer was always the same, and never farther away than the nearest sword. For </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="416" height="15" font="1">a woman, a mother, the way was stonier and harder to know. </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">She took a late supper in the Great Hall with her garrison, to give them what </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">encouragement she could. Rymund the Rhymer sang through all the courses, sparing her the </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">need to talk. He closed with the song he had written about Robb’s victory at Oxcross. “<i>And </i></text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>the stars in the night were the eyes of his wolves, and the wind itself was their song.</i>” Between </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the verses, Rymund threw back his head and howled, and by the end, half of the hall was </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">howling along with him, even Desmond Grell, who was well in his cups. Their voices rang off </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Let them have their songs, if it makes them brave</i>, Catelyn thought, toying with her silver </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There was always a singer at Evenfall Hall when I was a girl,” Brienne said quietly. “I </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">learned all the songs by heart.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Sansa did the same, though few singers ever cared to make the long journey north to </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Winterfell.” <i>I told her there would be singers at the king’s court, though. I told her she would </i></text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>hear music of all sorts, that her father could find some master to help her learn the high harp. </i></text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="167" height="15" font="5"><i>Oh, gods forgive me . . .</i> </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Brienne said, “I remember a woman . . . she came from some place across the narrow </text>

<text top="360" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">She had eyes the color of plums and her waist was so tiny my father could put his hands </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">around it. His hands were almost as big as mine.” She closed her long, thick fingers, as if to </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">hide them. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="321" height="15" font="1">“Did you sing for your father?” Catelyn asked. </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Brienne shook her head, staring down at her trencher as if to find some answer in the </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">gravy. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="132" height="15" font="1">“For Lord Renly?” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="572" height="15" font="1">The girl reddened. “Never, I . . . his fool, he made cruel japes sometimes, and I . . .” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="235" height="15" font="1">“Someday you must sing for me.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I . . . please, I have no gift.” Brienne pushed back from the table. “Forgive me, my lady. </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="200" height="15" font="1">Do I have your leave to go?” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn nodded. The tall, ungainly girl left the hall with long strides, almost unnoticed </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">amidst the revelry. <i>May the gods go with her</i>, she thought as she returned listlessly to her </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="54" height="15" font="1">supper. </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was three days later when the hammer blow that Brienne had foretold fell, and five </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">days before they heard of it. Catelyn was sitting with her father when Edmure’s messenger </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">arrived. The man’s armor was dinted, his boots dusty, and he had a ragged hole in his surcoat, </text>
<text top="737" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but the look on his face as he knelt was enough to tell her that the news was good. “Victory, </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">my lady.” He handed her Edmure’s letter. Her hand trembled as she broke the seal. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin had tried to force a crossing at a dozen different fords, her brother wrote, but </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">every thrust had been thrown back. Lord Lefford had been drowned, the Crakehall knight </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">called Strongboar taken captive, Ser Addam Marbrand  thrice  forced  to  retreat . . . but  the </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fiercest battle had been fought at Stone Mill, where Ser Gregor Clegane had led the assault. </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">So many of his men had fallen that their dead horses threatened to dam the flow. In the end </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Mountain and a handful of his best had gained the west bank, but Edmure had thrown his </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">reserve at them, and they had shattered and reeled away bloody and beaten. Ser Gregor </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">himself had lost his horse and staggered back across the Red Fork bleeding from a dozen </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wounds while a rain of arrows and stones fell all around him. “They shall not cross, Cat,” </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Edmure scrawled, “Lord Tywin is marching to the southeast. A feint perhaps, or full retreat, it </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="236" height="15" font="1">matters not. <i>They shall not cross</i>.” </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Desmond Grell had been elated. “Oh, if only I might have been with him,” the old </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knight said when she read him the letter. “Where is that fool Rymund? There’s a song in this, </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by the gods, and one that even Edmure will want to hear. The mill that ground the Mountain </text>

<page number="353" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ll hear no songs until the fighting’s done,” Catelyn said, perhaps too sharply. Yet she </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">allowed Ser Desmond to spread the word, and agreed when he suggested breaking open some </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">casks in honor of Stone Mill. The mood within Riverrun had been strained and somber; they </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="312" height="15" font="1">would all be better for a little drink and hope. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">That night the castle rang to the sounds of celebration. “<i>Riverrun!</i>” the smallfolk shouted, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and “Tully! Tully!” They’d come frightened and helpless, and her brother had taken them in </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">when most lords would have closed their gates. Their voices floated in through the high </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">windows, and seeped under the heavy redwood doors. Rymund played his harp, accompanied </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">by a pair of drummers and a youth with a set of reed pipes. Catelyn listened to girlish </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">laughter, and the excited chatter of the green boys her brother had left her for a garrison. Good </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">sounds . . . and yet they did not touch her. She could not share their happiness. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In her father’s solar she found a heavy leather-bound book of maps and opened it to the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">riverlands. Her eyes found the path of the Red Fork and traced it by flickering candlelight. </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Marching to the southeast</i>, she thought. By now they had likely reached the headwaters of the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">Blackwater Rush, she decided. </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She closed the book even more uneasy than before. The gods had granted them victory </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">after victory. At Stone Mill, at Oxcross, in the Battle of the Camps, at the Whispering </text>

<text top="578" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The sound was the faintest of <i>clinks</i>, a scraping of steel over stone. He lifted his head </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">from his paws, listening, sniffing at the night. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The evening’s rain had woken a hundred sleeping smells and made them ripe and strong </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">again. Grass and thorns, blackberries broken on the ground, mud, worms, rotting leaves, a rat </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">creeping through the bush. He caught the shaggy black scent of his brother’s coat and the </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sharp coppery tang of blood from the squirrel he’d killed. Other squirrels moved through the </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">branches above, smelling of wet fur and fear, their little claws scratching at the bark. The </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">noise had sounded something like that. </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And he heard it again, <i>clink</i> and scrape. It brought him to his feet. His ears pricked and </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his tail rose. He howled, a long deep shivery cry, a howl to wake the sleepers, but the piles of </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man-rock were dark and dead. A still wet night, a night to drive men into their holes. The rain </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had stopped, but the men still hid from the damp, huddled by the fires in their caves of piled </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">stone. </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His brother came sliding through the trees, moving almost as quiet as another brother he </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">remembered dimly from long ago, the white one with the eyes of blood. <i>This</i> brother’s eyes </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were pools of shadow, but the fur on the back of his neck was bristling. He had heard the </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">sounds as well, and known they meant danger. </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">This time the <i>clink</i> and scrape were followed by a slithering and the soft swift patter of </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">skinfeet on stone. The wind brought the faintest whiff of a man-smell he did not know. </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="5"><i>Stranger. Danger. Death.</i> </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He ran toward the sound, his brother racing beside him. The stone dens rose before them, </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">walls slick and wet. He bared his teeth, but the man-rock took no notice. A gate loomed up, a </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">black iron snake coiled tight about bar and post. When he crashed against it, the gate </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shuddered and the snake clanked and slithered and held. Through the bars he could look down </text>

<page number="354" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the long stone burrow that ran between the walls to the stony field beyond, but there was no </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">way through. He could force his muzzle between the bars, but no more. Many a time his </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brother had tried to crack the black bones of the gate between his teeth, but they would not </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">break. They had tried to dig under, but there were great flat stones beneath, half-covered by </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">earth and blown leaves. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Snarling, he paced back and forth in front of the gate, then threw himself at it once more. </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">It moved a little and slammed him back. <i>Locked</i>, something whispered. <i>Chained.</i> The voice </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he did not hear, the scent without a smell. The other ways were closed as well. Where doors </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">opened in the walls of man-rock, the wood was thick and strong. There was no way out. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>There is</i>, the whisper came, and it seemed as if he could see the shadow of a great tree </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">covered in needles, slanting up out of the black earth to ten times the height of a man. Yet </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when he looked about, it was not there. <i>The other side of the godswood, the sentinel, hurry, </i></text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="5"><i>hurry . . .</i> </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="414" height="15" font="1">Through the gloom of night came a muffled shout, cut short. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Swiftly, swiftly, he whirled and bounded back into the trees, wet leaves rustling beneath </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his paws, branches whipping at him as he rushed past. He could hear his brother following </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">close. They plunged under the heart tree and around the cold pool, through the blackberry </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bushes, under a tangle of oaks and ash and hawthorn scrub, to the far side of the wood . . . and </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">there it was, the shadow he’d glimpsed without seeing, the slanting tree pointing at the </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">rooftops. <i>Sentinel</i>, came the thought. </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He remembered how it was to climb it then. The needles everywhere, scratching at his </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bare face and falling down the back of his neck, the sticky sap on his hands, the sharp piney </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smell of it. It was an easy tree for a boy to climb, leaning as it did, crooked, the branches so </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="479" height="15" font="1">close together they almost made a ladder, slanting right up to the roof. </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Growling, he sniffed around the base of the tree, lifted a leg and marked it with a stream </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of urine. A low branch brushed his face, and he snapped at it, twisting and pulling until the </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wood cracked and tore. His mouth was full of needles and the bitter taste of the sap. He shook </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="146" height="15" font="1">his head and snarled. </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His brother sat back on his haunches and lifted his voice in a ululating howl, his song </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">black with mourning. The way was no way. They were not squirrels, nor the cubs of men, </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they could not wriggle up the trunks of trees, clinging with soft pink paws and clumsy feet. </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">They were runners, hunters, prowlers. </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Off across the night, beyond the stone that hemmed them close, the dogs woke and began </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to bark. One and then another and then all of them, a great clamor. They smelled it too; the </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">scent of foes and fear. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">A desperate fury filled him, hot as hunger. He sprang away from the wall loped off </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beneath the trees, the shadows of branch and leaf dappling his grey fur . . . and then he turned </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and raced back in a rush. His feet flew kicking up wet leaves and pine needles, and for a little </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">time he was a hunter and an antlered stag was fleeing before him and he could see it, smell it, </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and he ran full-out in pursuit. The smell of fear made his heart thunder and slaver ran from his </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">jaws, and he reached the falling tree in stride and threw himself up the trunk, claws scrabbling </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at the bark for purchase. Upward he bounded, <i>up</i>, two bounds, three, hardly slowing, until he </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was among the lower limbs. Branches tangled his feet and whipped at his eyes, grey-green </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">needles scattered as he shouldered through them, snapping. He had to slow. Something </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">snagged at his foot and he wrenched it free, snarling. The trunk narrowed under him, the slope </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">steeper, almost straight up, and wet. The bark tore like skin when he tried to claw at it. He was </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a third of the way up, halfway, more, the roof was almost within reach . . . and then he put </text>
<text top="1070" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">down a foot and felt it slip off the curve of wet wood, and suddenly he was sliding, stumbling. </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He yowled in fear and fury, falling, <i>falling</i>, and twisted around while the ground rushed up to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">And then Bran was back abed in his lonely tower room, tangled in his blankets, his </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">breath coming hard. “Summer,” he cried aloud. “Summer.” His shoulder seemed to ache, as if </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he had fallen on it, but he knew it was only the ghost of what the wolf was feeling. <i>Jojen told </i></text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>it true. I am a beastling.</i> Outside he could hear the faint barking of dogs. <i>The sea has come. </i></text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>It’s flowing over the walls, just as Jojen saw.</i> Bran grabbed the bar overhead and pulled </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">himself up, shouting for help. No one came, and after a moment he remembered that no one </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would. They had taken the guard off his door. Ser Rodrik had needed every man of fighting </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">age he could lay his hands on, so Winterfell had been left with only a token garrison. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The rest had left eight days past, six hundred men from Winterfell and the nearest </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">holdfasts. Cley Cerwyn was bringing three hundred more to join them on the march, and </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin had sent ravens before them, summoning levies from White Harbor and the </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">barrowlands and even the deep places inside the wolfswood. Torrhen’s Square was under </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">attack by some monstrous war chief named Dagmer Cleftjaw. Old Nan said he couldn’t be </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">killed, that once a foe had cut his head in two with an axe, but Dagmer was so fierce he’d just </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pushed the two halves back together and held them until they healed up. <i>Could Dagmer have </i></text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="466" height="15" font="5"><i>won?</i> Torrhen’s Square was many days from Winterfell, yet still . . . </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Bran pulled himself from the bed, moving bar to bar until he reached the windows. His </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">fingers fumbled a little as he swung back the shutters. The yard was empty, and all the </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">windows he could see were black. Winterfell slept. “<i>Hodor!</i>” he shouted down, as loud as he </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">could. Hodor would be asleep above the stables, but maybe if he yelled loud enough he’d </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hear, or <i>somebody</i> would. “<i>Hodor, come fast! Osha! Meera, Jojen, anyone!</i>” Bran cupped his </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="353" height="15" font="1">hands around his mouth. “<i>HOOOOODOOOOOR!</i>” </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But when the door crashed open behind him, the man who stepped through was no one </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Bran knew. He wore a leather jerkin sewn with overlapping iron disks, and carried a dirk in </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one hand and an axe strapped to his back. “What do you want?” Bran demanded, afraid. “This </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="233" height="15" font="1">is my room. You get out of here.” </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="601" height="15" font="1">Theon Greyjoy followed him into the bedchamber. “We’re not here to harm you, Bran.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="515" height="15" font="1">“Theon?” Bran felt dizzy with relief. “Did Robb send you? Is he here too?” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">“Robb’s far away. He can’t help you now.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“Help me?” He was confused. “Don’t scare me, Theon.” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I’m  <i>Prince</i> Theon now. We’re both princes, Bran. Who would have dreamed it? But </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">I’ve taken your castle, my prince.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="381" height="15" font="1">“Winterfell?” Bran shook his head. “No, you <i>couldn’t</i>.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Leave us, Werlag.” The man with the dirk withdrew. Theon seated himself on the bed. </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“I sent four men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes, and they opened a postern </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gate for the rest of us. My men are dealing with yours even now. I promise you, Winterfell is </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">mine.” </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">Bran did not understand. “But you’re Father’s <i>ward</i>.” </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And now you and your brother are <i>my</i> wards. As soon as the fighting’s done, my men </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">will be bringing the rest of your people together in the Great Hall. You and I are going to </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">speak to them. You’ll tell them how you’ve yielded Winterfell to me, and command them to </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="345" height="15" font="1">serve and obey their new lord as they did the old.” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I <i>won’t</i>,” said Bran. “We’ll fight you and throw you out. I never yielded, you can’t make </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This is no game, Bran, so don’t play the boy with me, I won’t stand for it. The castle is </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mine, but these people are still yours. If the prince would keep them safe, he’d best do as he’s </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">told.” He rose and went to the door. “Someone will come dress you and carry you to the Great </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="1">Hall. Think carefully on what you want to say.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The waiting made Bran feel even more helpless than before. He sat in the window seat, </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">staring out at dark towers and walls black as shadow. Once he thought he heard shouting </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beyond the Guards Hall, and something that might have been the clash of swords, but he did </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not have Summer’s ears to hear, nor his nose to smell. <i>Awake, I am still broken, but when I </i></text>
<text top="266" left="139" width="445" height="15" font="5"><i>sleep, when I’m Summer, I can run and fight and hear and smell.</i> </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He had expected that Hodor would come for him, or maybe one of the serving girls, but </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">when the door next opened it was Maester Luwin, carrying a candle. “Bran,” he said, </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“you . . . know what has happened? You have been told?” The skin was broken above his left </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="311" height="15" font="1">eye, and blood ran down that side of his face. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="328" height="15" font="1">“Theon came. He said Winterfell was his now.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The maester set down the candle and wiped the blood off his cheek. “They swam the </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moat. Climbed the walls with hook and rope. Came over wet and dripping, steel in hand.” He </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sat on the chair by the door, as fresh blood flowed. “Alebelly was on the gate, they surprised </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him in the turret and killed him. Hayhead’s wounded as well. I had time to send off two </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ravens before they burst in. The bird to White Harbor got away, but they brought down the </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">other with an arrow.” The maester stared at the rushes. “Ser Rodrik took too many of our </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">men, but I am to blame as much as he is. I never saw this danger, I never . . .” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="380" height="15" font="5"><i>Jojen saw it</i>, Bran thought. “You better help me dress.” </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Yes, that’s so.” In the heavy ironbound chest at the foot of Bran’s bed the maester found </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">smallclothes, breeches, and tunic. “You are the Stark in Winterfell, and Robb’s heir. You </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="424" height="15" font="1">must look princely.” Together they garbed him as befit a lord. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Theon wants me to yield the castle,” Bran said as the maester was fastening the cloak </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="354" height="15" font="1">with his favorite wolf’s-head clasp of silver and jet. </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“There is no shame in that. A lord must protect his smallfolk. Cruel places breed cruel </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">peoples, Bran, remember that as you deal with these ironmen. Your lord father did what he </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">could to gentle Theon, but I fear it was too little and too late.” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The ironman who came for them was a squat thick-bodied man with a coal-black beard </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that covered half his chest. He bore the boy easily enough, though he looked none too happy </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with the task. Rickon’s bedchamber was a half turn down the steps. The four-year-old was </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">cranky at being woken. “I want Mother,” he said. “I <i>want</i> her. And Shaggydog too.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your mother is far away, my prince.” Maester Luwin pulled a bed-robe over the child’s </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">head. “But I’m here, and Bran.” He took Rickon by the hand and led him out. </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Below, they came on Meera and Jojen being herded from their room by a bald man </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whose spear was three feet taller than he was. When Jojen looked at Bran, his eyes were green </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pools full of sorrow. Other ironmen had rousted the Freys. “Your brother’s lost his kingdom,” </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">Little Walder told Bran. “You’re no prince now, just a hostage.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="336" height="15" font="1">“So are you,” Jojen said, “and me, and all of us.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="271" height="15" font="1">“No one was talking to you, frogeater.” </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One of the ironmen went before them carrying a torch, but the rain had started again and </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">soon drowned it out. As they hurried across the yard they could hear the direwolves howling </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">in the godswood. <i>I hope Summer wasn’t hurt falling from the tree.</i> </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Theon Greyjoy was seated in the high seat of the Starks. He had taken off his cloak. Over </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a shirt of fine mail he wore a black surcoat emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">His hands rested on the wolves’ heads carved at the ends of the wide stone arms. “Theon’s </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">sitting in Robb’s chair,” Rickon said. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Hush, Rickon.” Bran could feel the menace around them, but his brother was too young. </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">A few torches had been lit, and a fire kindled in the great hearth, but most of the hall remained </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in darkness. There was no place to sit with the benches stacked against the walls, so the castle </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">folk stood in small groups, not daring to speak. He saw Old Nan, her toothless mouth opening </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and closing. Hayhead was carried in between two of the other guards, a bloodstained bandage </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">wrapped about his bare chest. Poxy Tym wept inconsolably, and Beth Cassel cried with fear. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="411" height="15" font="1">“What have we here?” Theon asked of the Reeds and Freys. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“These are Lady Catelyn’s wards, both named Walder Frey,” Maester Luwin explained. </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">“And this is Jojen Reed and his sister Meera, son and daughter to Howland Reed of </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">Greywater Watch, who came to renew their oaths of fealty to Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Some might call that ill-timed,” said Theon, “though not for me. Here you are and here </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">you’ll stay.” He vacated the high seat. “Bring the prince here, Lorren.” The black-bearded </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">man dumped Bran onto the stone as if he were a sack of oats. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">People were still being driven into the Great Hall, prodded along with shouts and the </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">butts of the spears. Gage and Osha arrived from the kitchens, spotted with flour from making </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the morning bread. Mikken they dragged in cursing. Farlen entered limping, struggling to </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">support Palla. Her dress had been ripped in two; she held it up with a clenched fist and walked </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as if every step were agony. Septon Chayle rushed to lend a hand, but one of the ironmen </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">knocked him to the floor. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The last man marched through the doors was the prisoner Reek, whose stench preceded </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him, ripe and pungent. Bran felt his stomach twist at the smell of him. “We found this one </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">locked in a tower cell,” announced his escort, a beardless youth with ginger-colored hair and </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="639" height="15" font="1">sodden clothing, doubtless one of those who’d swum the moat. “He says they call him Reek.” </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Can’t think why,” Theon said, smiling. “Do you always smell so bad, or did you just </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">finish fucking a pig?” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Haven’t fucked no one since they took me, m’lord. Heke’s me true name. I was in </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">service to the Bastard o’ the Dreadfort till the Starks give him an arrow in the back for a </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="102" height="15" font="1">wedding gift.” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">Theon found that amusing. “Who did he marry?” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="250" height="15" font="1">“The widow o’ Hornwood, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="568" height="15" font="1">“That crone? Was he blind? She has teats like empty wineskins, dry and withered.” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="301" height="15" font="1">“It wasn’t her teats he wed her for, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The ironmen slammed shut the tall doors at the foot of the hall. From the high seat, Bran </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">could see about twenty of them. <i>He probably left some guards on the gates and the armory.</i> </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="299" height="15" font="1">Even so, there couldn’t be more than thirty. </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="380" height="15" font="1">Theon raised his hands for quiet. “You all know me—” </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aye, we know you for a sack of steaming dung!” shouted Mikken, before the bald man </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drove the butt of his spear into his gut, then smashed him across the face with the shaft. The </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="334" height="15" font="1">smith stumbled to his knees and spat out a tooth. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Mikken, you be silent.” Bran tried to sound stern and lordly, the way Robb did when he </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="601" height="15" font="1">made a command, but his voice betrayed him and the words came out in a shrill squeak. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="590" height="15" font="1">“Listen to your little lordling, Mikken,” said Theon. “He has more sense than you do.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="5"><i>A good lord protects his people</i>, he reminded himself. “I’ve yielded Winterfell to </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">Theon.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="252" height="15" font="1">“Louder, Bran. And call me prince.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He raised his voice. “I have yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon. All of you should do as </text>

<text top="243" left="171" width="265" height="15" font="1">“Damned if I will!” bellowed Mikken. </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon ignored the outburst. “My father has donned the ancient crown of salt and rock, </text>
<text top="288" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and declared himself King of the Iron Islands. He claims the north as well, by right of </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="243" height="15" font="1">conquest. You are all his subjects.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Bugger that.</i>” Mikken wiped the blood from his mouth. “I serve the Starks, not some </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">treasonous squid of—<i>aah</i>.” The butt of the spear smashed him face-first into the stone floor. </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Smiths have strong arms and weak heads,” observed Theon. “But if the rest of you serve </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">me as loyally as you served Ned Stark, you’ll find me as generous a lord as you could want.” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">On his hands and knees, Mikken spat blood. <i>Please don’t</i>, Bran wished at him, but the </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="555" height="15" font="1">blacksmith shouted, “If you think you can hold the north with this sorry lot o’—” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The bald man drove the point of his spear into the back of Mikken’s neck. Steel slid </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through flesh and came out his throat in a welter of blood. A woman screamed, and Meera </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrapped her arms around Rickon. <i>It’s blood he drowned on</i>, Bran thought numbly. <i>His own </i></text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="5"><i>blood.</i> </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="1">“Who else has something to say?” asked Theon Greyjoy. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="386" height="15" font="1">“<i>Hodor hodor hodor hodor</i>,” shouted Hodor, eyes wide. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="270" height="15" font="1">“Someone kindly shut that halfwit up.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Two ironmen began to beat Hodor with the butts of their spears. The stableboy dropped </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="352" height="15" font="1">to the floor, trying to shield himself with his hands. </text>
<text top="670" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I will be as good a lord to you as Eddard Stark ever was.” Theon raised his voice to be </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">heard above the smack of wood on flesh. “Betray me, though, and you’ll wish you hadn’t. </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">And don’t think the men you see here are the whole of my power. Torrhen’s Square and </text>

<text top="792" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Stark’s lords will fight you,” the man Reek called out. “That bloated pig at White </text>

<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon weighed him a moment. “You’re cleverer than you smell, but I could not suffer </text>

<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya made a rude noise. Pia was always seeing things in the buttery. Usually they were </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="436" height="15" font="1">men. “Can I have a tart?” she asked. “You baked a whole tray.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="355" height="15" font="1">“I need a whole tray. Ser Amory is partial to them.” </text>
<text top="634" left="171" width="300" height="15" font="1">She hated Ser Amory. “Let’s spit on them.” </text>

<text top="678" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">other cooks and scullions were all asleep in the cavernous lofts above the ovens. “He’ll </text>

<text top="723" left="171" width="328" height="15" font="1">“He will not,” Arya said. “You can’t taste <i>spit</i>.” </text>

<text top="792" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was, but Arya never minded. Even in the black of night, the kitchens were never still; </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">there was always someone rolling dough for the morning bread, stirring a kettle with a long </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">wooden spoon, or butchering a hog for Ser Amory’s breakfast bacon. Tonight it was Hot Pie. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="378" height="15" font="1">“If Pinkeye wakes and finds you gone—” Hot Pie said. </text>
<text top="882" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Pinkeye never wakes.” His true name was Mebble, but everyone called him Pinkeye for </text>

<text top="921" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">evening he fell into a drunken sleep after supper, wine-colored spit running down his chin. </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Arya would wait until she heard him snoring, then creep barefoot up the servants’ stair, </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">making no more noise than the mouse she’d been. She carried neither candle nor taper. Syrio </text>

<text top="1018" left="139" width="206" height="15" font="1">I was gone,” she told Hot Pie. </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I don’t want to escape. It’s better here than it was in them woods. I don’t want to eat no </text>

<text top="154" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Listen with your <i>ears</i>, not your mouth. That was a warhorn. Two blasts, didn’t you </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m making the morning bread,” Hot Pie complained. “Anyhow I don’t like it when it’s </text>

<text top="282" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">“I’m going. I’ll tell you after. Can I have a tart?” </text>

<text top="333" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She filched one anyway, and ate it on her way out. It was stuffed with chopped nuts and </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fruit and cheese, the crust flaky and still warm from the oven. Eating Ser Amory’s tart made </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Arya feel daring. <i>Barefoot surefoot lightfoot</i>, she sang under her breath. <i>I am the ghost in </i></text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="5"><i>Harrenhal.</i> </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The horn had stirred the castle from sleep; men were coming out into the ward to see </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">what the commotion was about. Arya fell in with the others. A line of ox carts were rumbling </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">under the portcullis. <i>Plunder</i>, she knew at once. The riders escorting the carts spoke in a </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">babble of queer tongues. Their armor glinted pale in the moonlight, and she saw a pair of </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">striped black-and-white horses. <i>The Bloody Mummers.</i> Arya withdrew a little deeper into the </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shadows, and watched as a huge black bear rolled by, caged in the back of a wagon. Other </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">carts were loaded down with silver plate, weapons and shields, bags of flour, pens of </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">squealing hogs and scrawny dogs and chickens. Arya was thinking how long it had been since </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">she’d had a slice off a pork roast when she saw the first of the prisoners. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By his bearing and the proud way he held his head, he must have been a lord. She could </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see mail glinting beneath his torn red surcoat. At first Arya took him for a Lannister, but when </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he passed near a torch she saw his device was a silver fist, not a lion. His wrists were bound </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tightly, and a rope around one ankle tied him to the man behind him, and him to the man </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">behind him, so the whole column had to shuffle along in a lurching lockstep. Many of the </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">captives were wounded. If any halted, one of the riders would trot up and give him a lick of </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the whip to get him moving again. She tried to judge how many prisoners there were, but lost </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">count before she got to fifty. There were twice that many at least. Their clothing was stained </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with mud and blood, and in the torchlight it was hard to make out all their badges and sigils, </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">but some of those Arya glimpsed she recognized. Twin towers. Sunburst. Bloody man. Battle-</text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">axe. <i>The battle-axe is for Cerwyn, and the white sun on black is Karstark. They’re northmen. </i></text>

<text top="836" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Bloody Mummers began to dismount. Stableboys emerged sleepy from their straw to </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">tend their lathered horses. One of the riders was shouting for ale. The noise brought Ser </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">Amory Lorch out onto the covered gallery above the ward, flanked by two torchbearers. Goat-</text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">helmed Vargo Hoat reined up below him. “My lord cathellan,” the sellsword said. He had a </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="439" height="15" font="1">thick, slobbery voice, as if his tongue was too big for his mouth. </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="395" height="15" font="1">“What’s all this, Hoat?” Ser Amory demanded, frowning. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Captiths. Rooth Bolton thought to croth the river, but my Brafe Companions cut his van </text>

<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Amory Lorch stared down at the roped captives with his little pig eyes. Arya did not </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">think he was pleased. Everyone in the castle knew that he and Vargo Hoat hated each other. </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">“Very well,” he said. “Ser Cadwyn, take these men to the dungeons.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat raised his eyes. “We were promised </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">honorable treatment—” he began. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“<i>Silenth!</i>” Vargo Hoat screamed at him, spraying spittle. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Amory addressed the captives. “What Hoat promised you is nothing to me. Lord </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tywin made <i>me</i> the castellan of Harrenhal, and I shall do with you as I please.” He gestured </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to his guards. “The great cell under the Widow’s Tower ought to hold them all. Any who do </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">not care to go are free to die here.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">As his men herded off the captives at spear-point, Arya saw Pinkeye emerge from the </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stairwell, blinking at the torchlight. If he found her missing, he would shout and threaten to </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">whip the bloody hide off her, but she was not afraid. He was no Weese. He was forever </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">threatening to whip the bloody hide off this one or that one, but Arya never actually knew him </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to <i>hit</i>. Still, it would be better if he never saw her. She glanced around. The oxen were being </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">unharnessed, the carts unloaded, while the Brave Companions clamored for drink and the </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">curious gathered around the caged bear. In the commotion, it was not hard to slip off unseen. </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She went back the way she had come, wanting to be out of sight before someone noticed her </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="215" height="15" font="1">and thought to put her to work. </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Away from the gates and the stables, the great castle was largely deserted. The noise </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dwindled behind her. A swirling wind gusted, drawing a high shivery scream from the cracks </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the Wailing Tower. Leaves had begun to fall from the trees in the godswood, and she could </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hear them moving through the deserted courtyards and between the empty buildings, making </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a faint skittery sound as the wind drove them across the stones. Now that Harrenhal was near </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">empty once again, sound did queer things here. Sometimes the stones seemed to drink up </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">noise, shrouding the yards in a blanket of silence. Other times, the echoes had a life of their </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">own, so every footfall became the tread of a ghostly army, and every distant voice a ghostly </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="568" height="15" font="1">feast. The funny sounds were one of the things that bothered Hot Pie, but not Arya. </text>
<text top="619" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Quiet as a shadow, she flitted across the middle bailey, around the Tower of Dread, and </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">through the empty mews, where people said the spirits of dead falcons stirred the air with </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">ghostly wings. She could go where she would. The garrison numbered no more than a </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">hundred men, so small a troop that they were lost in Harrenhal. The Hall of a Hundred </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Hearths was closed off, along with many of the lesser buildings, even the Wailing Tower. Ser </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Amory Lorch resided in the castellan’s chambers in Kingspyre, themselves as spacious as a </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lord’s, and Arya and the other servants had moved to the cellars beneath him so they would be </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">close at hand. While Lord Tywin had been in residence, there was always a man-at-arms </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">wanting to know your business. But now there were only a hundred men left to guard a </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="554" height="15" font="1">thousand doors, and no one seemed to know who should be where, or care much. </text>
<text top="819" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">As she passed the armory, Arya heard the ring of a hammer. A deep orange glow shone </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through the high windows. She climbed to the roof and peeked down. Gendry was beating out </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a breastplate. When he worked, nothing existed for him but metal, bellows, fire. The hammer </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was like part of his arm. She watched the play of muscles in his chest and listened to the steel </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">music he made. <i>He’s strong</i>, she thought. As he took up the long-handled tongs to dip the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">breastplate into the quenching trough, Arya slithered through the window and leapt down to </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">the floor beside him. </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He did not seem surprised to see her. “You should be abed, girl.” The breastplate hissed </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">like a cat as he dipped it in the cold water. “What was all that noise?” </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Vargo Hoat’s come back with prisoners. I saw their badges. There’s a Glover, from </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Deepwood Motte, he’s my father’s man. The rest too, mostly.” All of a sudden, Arya knew </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="492" height="15" font="1">why her feet had brought her here. “You have to help me get them out.” </text>
<text top="1070" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">Gendry laughed. “And how do we do that?” </text>
</page>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Ser Amory sent them down to the dungeon. The one under the Widow’s Tower, that’s </text>

<text top="174" left="171" width="369" height="15" font="1">Arya chewed her lips. “We’d need to kill the guards.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“How are we supposed to do that?” </text>

<text top="428" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Well, you can’t get them out, no more’n you could save Lommy.” Gendry turned the </text>
<text top="447" left="139" width="627" height="15" font="1">breastplate with the tongs to look at it closely. “And if we did escape, where would we go?” </text>
<text top="472" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“Winterfell,” she said at once. “I’d tell Mother how you helped me, and you could stay—</text>

<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stream meandered through the wood, and there was one spot where it had eaten the ground </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">away beneath a deadfall. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">There, beneath rotting wood and twisted splintered branches, she found her hidden </text>

<text top="561" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Whenever she had a free hour she stole away to work at the drills Syrio had taught her, </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">moving barefoot over the fallen leaves, slashing at branches and whacking down leaves. </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Sometimes she even climbed the trees and danced among the upper branches, her toes </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gripping the limbs as she moved back and forth, teetering a little less every day as her balance </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="509" height="15" font="1">returned to her. Night was the best time; no one ever bothered her at night. </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya climbed. Up in the kingdom of the leaves, she unsheathed and for a time forgot </text>

<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ribbons. When her arm grew weary, she sat with her legs over a high limb to catch her breath </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in the cool dark air, listening to the squeak of bats as they hunted. Through the leafy canopy </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she could see the bone-white branches of the heart tree. <i>It looks just like the one in Winterfell </i></text>

<text top="864" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Shoving her sword through her belt, she slipped down branch to branch until she was </text>

<text top="923" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">at the face carved into its trunk. It was a terrible face, its mouth twisted, its eyes flaring and </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">full of hate. Is that what a god looked like? Could gods be hurt, the same as people? <i>I should </i></text>

<text top="987" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya went to her knees. She wasn’t sure how she should begin. She clasped her hands </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">together.  <i>Help me, you old gods</i>, she prayed silently. <i>Help me get those men out of the </i></text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Was that enough? Maybe she should pray aloud if she wanted the old gods to hear. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">Maybe she should pray longer. Sometimes her father had prayed a long time, she </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">remembered. But the old gods had never helped him. Remembering that made her angry. </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“You should have saved him,” she scolded the tree. “He prayed to you all the time. I don’t </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The voice startled her. She leapt to her feet and drew her wooden sword. Jaqen H’ghar </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stood so still in the darkness that he seemed one of the trees. “A man comes to hear a name. </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="588" height="15" font="1">Arya lowered the splintery point toward the ground. “How did you know I was here?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">“A man sees. A man hears. A man knows.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She regarded him suspiciously. Had the gods sent him? “How’d you make the dog kill </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="586" height="15" font="1">Weese? Did you call Rorge and Biter up from hell? Is Jaqen H’ghar your true name?” </text>

<text top="416" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She backed away from him, until she was pressed against the heart tree. “Did Gendry </text>

<text top="461" left="171" width="353" height="15" font="1">“A man knows,” he said again. “My lady of Stark.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maybe the gods <i>had</i> sent him in answer to her prayers. “I need you to help me get those </text>

<text top="550" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A girl forgets,” he said quietly. “Two she has had, three were owed. If a guard must die, </text>

<text top="595" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“But <i>one</i> guard won’t be enough, we need to kill them all to open the cell.” Arya bit her </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">lip hard to stop from crying. “I want you to save the northmen like I saved you.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He looked down at her pitilessly. “Three lives were snatched from a god. Three lives </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="491" height="15" font="1">must be repaid. The gods are not mocked.” His voice was silk and steel. </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I never mocked.” She thought for a moment. “The name . . . can I name <i>anyone?</i> And </text>

<text top="843" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">“Swear it,” Arya said. “Swear it by the gods.” </text>
<text top="868" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“By all the gods of sea and air, and even him of fire, I swear it.” He placed a hand in the </text>

<text top="129" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The gods did hear,” There was a knife in his hand suddenly, its blade thin as her little </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">finger. Whether it was meant for her or him, Arya could not say. “A girl will weep. A girl will </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You’re not my friend. A friend would <i>help</i> me.” She stepped away from him, balanced </text>

<text top="282" left="171" width="320" height="15" font="1">“A girl might,” she said. “If a friend did help.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="202" height="15" font="1">The knife vanished. “Come.” </text>

<text top="447" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Despite the hour, Harrenhal stirred with fitful life. Vargo Hoat’s arrival had thrown off </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all the routines. Ox carts, oxen, and horses had all vanished from the yard, but the bear cage </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was still there. It had been hung from the arched span of the bridge that divided the outer and </text>

<text top="525" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the area in light. Some of the boys from the stables were tossing stones to make the bear roar </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">and grumble. Across the ward, light spilled through the door of the Barracks Hall, </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">accompanied by the clatter of tankards and men calling for more wine. A dozen voices took </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="362" height="15" font="1">up a song in a guttural tongue strange to Arya’s ears. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>They’re drinking and eating before they sleep</i>, she realized. <i>Pinkeye would have sent to </i></text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>wake me, to help with the serving. He’ll know I’m not abed.</i> But likely he was busy pouring </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">for the Brave Companions and those of Ser Amory’s garrison who had joined them. The noise </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">they were making would be a good distraction. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The hungry gods will feast on blood tonight, if a man would do this thing,” Jaqen said. </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">“Sweet girl, kind and gentle. Unsay one name and say another and cast this mad dream aside.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="73" height="15" font="1">“I won’t.” </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Just so.” He seemed resigned. “The thing will be done, but a girl must obey. A man has </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="121" height="15" font="1">no time for talk.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">“A girl will obey,” Arya said. “What should I do?” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A hundred men are hungry, they must be fed, the lord commands hot broth. A girl must </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">run to the kitchens and tell her pie boy.” </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="307" height="15" font="1">“Broth,” she repeated. “Where will you be?” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A girl will help make broth, and wait in the kitchens until a man comes for her. Go. </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="44" height="15" font="1">Run.” </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie was pulling his loaves from the ovens when she burst into the kitchen, but he was </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">no longer alone. They’d woken the cooks to feed Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers. </text>
<text top="985" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Serving men were carrying off baskets of Hot Pie’s bread and tarts, the chief cook was </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">carving cold slices off a ham, spit boys were turning rabbits while the pot girls basted them </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with honey, women were chopping onions and carrots. “What do you want, Weasel?” the </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">chief cook asked when he saw her. </text>
<text top="1068" left="171" width="333" height="15" font="1">“Broth,” she announced. “My lord wants broth.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He jerked his carving knife at the black iron kettles hung over the flames. “What do you </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">think that is? Though I’d soon as piss in it as serve it to that goat. Can’t even let a man have a </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">night’s sleep.” He spat. “Well, never you mind, run back and tell him a kettle can’t be </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">hurried.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="230" height="15" font="1">“I’m to wait here until it’s done.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then stay out of the way. Or better yet, make yourself of use. Run to the buttery; his </text>

<text top="277" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">She ran as fast as she could. Pia was awake in the loft, moaning under one of the </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mummers, but she slipped back into her clothes quick enough when she heard Arya shout. </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She filled six baskets with crocks of butter and big wedges of stinky cheese wrapped in cloth. </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="292" height="15" font="1">“Here, help me with these,” she told Arya. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I can’t. But you better hurry or Vargo Hoat will chop off your foot.” She darted off </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">before Pia could grab her. On the way back, she wondered why none of the captives had their </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hands or feet chopped off. Maybe Vargo Hoat was afraid to make Robb angry. Though he </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="295" height="15" font="1">didn’t seem the sort to be afraid of <i>anyone</i>. </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie was stirring the kettles with a long wooden spoon when Arya returned to the </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">kitchens. She grabbed up a second spoon and started to help. For a moment she thought </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">maybe she should tell him, but then she remembered the village and decided not to. <i>He’d only </i></text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="5"><i>yield again.</i> </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Then she heard the ugly sound of Rorge’s voice. “<i>Cook</i>,” he shouted. “We’ll take your </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bloody broth.” Arya let go of the spoon in dismay. <i>I never told him to bring them.</i> Rorge wore </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his iron helmet, with the nasal that half hid his missing nose. Jaqen and Biter followed him </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="114" height="15" font="1">into the kitchen. </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The bloody broth isn’t bloody ready yet,” the cook said. “It needs to simmer. We only </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="204" height="15" font="1">now put in the onions and—” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Shut your hole, or I’ll shove a spit up your ass and we’ll baste you for a turn or two. I </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">said broth and I said now.” </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Hissing, Biter grabbed a handful of half-charred rabbit right off the spit, and tore into it </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">with his pointed teeth while honey dripped between his fingers. </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The cook was beaten. “Take your bloody broth, then, but if the goat asks why it tastes so </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">thin, you tell him.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Biter licked the grease and honey off his fingers as Jaqen H’ghar donned a pair of heavy </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">padded mitts. He gave a second pair to Arya. “A weasel will help.” The broth was boiling-hot, </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and the kettles were heavy. Arya and Jaqen wrestled one between them, Rorge carried one by </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">himself, and Biter grabbed two more, hissing in pain when the handles burned his hands. </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Even so, he did not drop them. They lugged the kettles out of the kitchens and across the </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">ward. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Two guards had been posted at the door of the Widow’s Tower. “What’s this?” one said </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="67" height="15" font="1">to Rorge. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">“A pot of boiling piss, want some?” </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="364" height="15" font="1">Jaqen smiled disarmingly. “A prisoner must eat too.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“No one said nothing about—” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">Arya cut him off. “It’s for <i>them</i>, not you.” </text>
<text top="1057" left="171" width="402" height="15" font="1">The second guard waved them past. “Bring it down, then.” </text>
</page>
<page number="367" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Inside the door a winding stair led down to the dungeons. Rorge led the way, with Jaqen </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">and Arya bringing up the rear. “A girl will stay out of the way,” he told her. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The steps opened onto a dank stone vault, long, gloomy, and windowless. A few torches </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">burned in sconces at the near end where a group of Ser Amory’s guards sat around a scarred </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wooden table, talking and playing at tiles. Heavy iron bars separated them from where the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">captives were crowded together in the dark. The smell of the broth brought many up to the </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">bars. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya counted eight guards. They smelled the broth as well. “There’s the ugliest serving </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="481" height="15" font="1">wench I ever saw,” their captain said to Rorge. “What’s in the kettle?” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="323" height="15" font="1">“Your cock and balls. You want to eat or not?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One of the guards had been pacing, one standing near the bars, a third sitting on the floor </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">with his back to the wall, but the prospect of food drew all of them to the table. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="230" height="15" font="1">“About bloody time they fed us.” </text>
<text top="391" left="171" width="158" height="15" font="1">“That onions I smell?” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="169" height="15" font="1">“So where’s the bread?” </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="274" height="15" font="1">“Fuck, we need bowls, cups, spoons—” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No you don’t.” Rorge heaved the scalding hot broth across the table, full in their faces. </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jaqen H’ghar did the same. Biter threw his kettles too, swinging them underarm so they spun </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">across the dungeon, raining soup. One caught the captain in the temple as he tried to rise. He </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">went down like a sack of sand and lay still. The rest were screaming in agony, praying, or </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">trying to crawl off. </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya pressed back against the wall as Rorge began to cut throats. Biter preferred to grab </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the men behind the head and under the chin and crack their necks with a single twist of his </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">huge pale hands. Only one of the guards managed to get a blade out. Jaqen danced away from </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his slash, drew his own sword, drove the man back into a corner with a flurry of blows, and </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">killed him with a thrust to the heart. The Lorathi brought the blade to Arya still red with </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heart’s blood and wiped it clean on the front of her shift. “A girl should be bloody too. This is </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="77" height="15" font="1">her work.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The key to the cell hung from a hook on the wall above the table. Rorge took it down and </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">opened the door. The first man through was the lord with the mailed fist on his surcoat. “Well </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="260" height="15" font="1">done,” he said. “I am Robett Glover.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="238" height="15" font="1">“My lord.” Jaqen gave him a bow. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Once freed, the captives stripped the dead guards of their weapons and darted up the </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steps with steel in hand. Their fellows crowded after them, bare-handed. They went swiftly, </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and with scarcely a word. None of them seemed quite so badly wounded as they had when </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Vargo Hoat had marched them through the gates of Harrenhal. “This of the soup, that was </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="584" height="15" font="1">clever,” the man Glover was saying. “I did not expect that. Was it Lord Hoat’s idea?” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Rorge began to laugh. He laughed so hard that snot flew out the hole where his nose had </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">been. Biter sat on top of one of the dead men, holding a limp hand as he gnawed at the </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">fingers. Bones cracked between his teeth. </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Who are you men?” A crease appeared between Robett Glover’s brows. “You were not </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="637" height="15" font="1">with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton’s encampment. Are you of the Brave Companions?” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="514" height="15" font="1">Rorge wiped the snot off his chin with the back of his hand. “We are now.” </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">discourteous companions are named Rorge and Biter. A lord will know which is Biter.” He </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="290" height="15" font="1">waved a hand toward Arya. “And here—” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m Weasel,” she blurted, before he could tell who she <i>really</i> was. She did not want her </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="613" height="15" font="1">name said here, where Rorge might hear, and Biter, and all these others she did not know. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She saw Glover dismiss her. “Very well,” he said. “Let’s make an end to this bloody </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="73" height="15" font="1">business.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When they climbed back up the winding stair, they found the door guards lying in pools </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of their own blood. Northmen were running across the ward. Arya heard shouts. The door of </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Barracks Hall burst open and a wounded man staggered out screaming. Three others ran after </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him and silenced him with spear and sword. There was fighting around the gatehouse as well. </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Rorge and Biter rushed off with Glover, but Jaqen H’ghar knelt beside Arya. “A girl does not </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">understand?” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“Yes I do,” she said, though she didn’t, not truly. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Lorathi must have seen it on her face. “A goat has no loyalty. Soon a wolf banner is </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">raised here, I think. But first a man would hear a certain name unsaid.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="522" height="15" font="1">“I take back the name.” Arya chewed her lip. “Do I still have a third death?” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A girl is greedy.” Jaqen touched one of the dead guards and showed her his bloody </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="606" height="15" font="1">fingers. “Here is three and there is four and eight more lie dead below. The debt is paid.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The debt is paid,” Arya agreed reluctantly. She felt a little sad. Now she was just a </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">mouse again. </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A god has his due. And now a man must die.” A strange smile touched the lips of Jaqen </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">H’ghar. </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Die?</i>” she said, confused. What did he mean? “But I unsaid the name. You don’t need to </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">die now.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I do. My time is done.” Jaqen passed a hand down his face from forehead to chin, and </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">where it went he <i>changed</i>. His cheeks grew fuller, his eyes closer; his nose hooked, a scar </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook his head, his </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">long straight hair, half red and half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls. </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya’s mouth hung open. “Who <i>are</i> you?” she whispered, too astonished to be afraid. </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">“How did you <i>do</i> that? Was it hard?” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He grinned, revealing a shiny gold tooth. “No harder than taking a new name, if you </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">know the way.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">“Show me,” she blurted. “I want to do it too.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="320" height="15" font="1">“If you would learn, you must come with me.” </text>
<text top="876" left="171" width="209" height="15" font="1">Arya grew hesitant. “Where?” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“Far and away, across the narrow sea.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">“I can’t. I have to go home. To Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then we must part,” he said, “for I have duties too.” He lifted her hand and pressed a </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">small coin into her palm. “Here.” </text>
<text top="996" left="171" width="93" height="15" font="1">“What is it?” </text>

<text top="1046" left="171" width="573" height="15" font="1">Arya bit it. It was so hard it could only be iron. “Is it worth enough to buy a horse?” </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Valar morghulis</i>,” Arya repeated. It wasn’t hard. Her fingers closed tight over the coin. </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">Across the yard, she could hear men dying. “Please don’t go, Jaqen.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Jaqen is as dead as Arry,” he said sadly, “and I have promises to keep. <i>Valar morghulis</i>, </text>

<text top="302" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and stalked off through the darkness, cloak swirling. She was alone with the dead men. <i>They </i></text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>deserved to die</i>, Arya told herself, remembering all those Ser Amory Lorch had killed at the </text>

<text top="366" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The cellars under Kingspyre were empty when she returned to her bed of straw. She </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whispered her names to her pillow, and when she was done she added, “<i>Valar morghulis</i>,” in </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="305" height="15" font="1">a small soft voice, wondering what it meant. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Come dawn, Pinkeye and the others were back, all but one boy who’d been killed in the </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fighting for no reason that anyone could say. Pinkeye went up alone to see how matters stood </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">by light of day, complaining all the while that his old bones could not abide steps. When he </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">returned, he told them that Harrenhal had been taken. “Them Bloody Mummers killed some </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Ser Amory’s lot in their beds, and the rest at table after they were good and drunk. The new </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lord will be here before the day’s out, with his whole host. He’s from the wild north up where </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that Wall is, and they say he’s a hard one. This lord or that lord, there’s still work to be done. </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Any foolery and I’ll whip the skin off your back.” He looked at Arya when he said that, but </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="462" height="15" font="1">never said a word to her about where she had been the night before. </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">All morning she watched the Bloody Mummers strip the dead of their valuables and drag </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the corpses to the Flowstone Yard, where a pyre was laid to dispose of them. Shagwell the </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Fool hacked the heads off two dead knights and pranced about the castle swinging them by </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the hair and making them talk. “What did you die of?” one head asked. “Hot weasel soup,” </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">replied the second. </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya was set to mopping up dried blood. No one said a word to her beyond the usual, but </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">every so often she would notice people looking at her strangely. Robett Glover and the other </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">men they’d freed must have talked about what had happened down in the dungeon, and then </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Shagwell and his stupid talking heads started in about the weasel soup. She would have told </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him to shut up, but she was scared to. The fool was half-mad, and she’d heard that he’d once </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">killed a man for not laughing at one of his japes. <i>He better shut his mouth or I’ll put him on </i></text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>my list with the rest</i>, she thought as she scrubbed at a reddish-brown stain. It was almost </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">evenfall when the new master of Harrenhal arrived. He had a plain face, beardless and </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ordinary, notable only for his queer pale eyes. Neither plump, thin, nor muscular, he wore </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">black ringmail and a spotted pink cloak. The sigil on his banner looked like a man dipped in </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood. “On your knees for the Lord of the Dreadfort!” shouted his squire, a boy no older than </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">Arya, and Harrenhal knelt. </text>
<text top="953" left="171" width="411" height="15" font="1">Vargo Hoat came forward. “My lord, Harrenhal ith yourth.” </text>
<text top="978" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The lord gave answer, but too softly for Arya to hear. Robett Glover and Ser Aenys Frey, </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">freshly bathed and clad in clean new doublets and cloaks, came up to join them. After some </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brief talk, Ser Aenys led them over to Rorge and Biter. Arya was surprised to see them still </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">here; somehow she would have expected them to vanish when Jaqen did. Arya heard the </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">harsh sound of Rorge’s voice, but not what he was saying. Then Shagwell pounced on her, </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">“Let <i>go</i>,” Arya said, wriggling out of his grasp. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The lord regarded her. Only his eyes moved; they were very pale, the color of ice. “How </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="138" height="15" font="1">old are you, child?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="355" height="15" font="1">She had to think for a moment to remember. “Ten.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="421" height="15" font="1">“Ten, <i>my lord</i>,” he reminded her. “Are you fond of animals?” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="166" height="15" font="1">“Some kinds. My lord.” </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="582" height="15" font="1">A thin smile twitched across his lips. “But not lions, it would seem. Nor manticores.” </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="394" height="15" font="1">She did not know what to say to that, so she said nothing. </text>
<text top="344" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“They tell me you are called Weasel. That will not serve. What name did your mother </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">give you?” </text>
<text top="389" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She bit her lip, groping for another name. Lommy had called her Lumpyhead, Sansa used </text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Horseface, and her father’s men once dubbed her Arya Underfoot, but she did not think any of </text>
<text top="428" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">those were the sort of name he wanted. </text>
<text top="453" left="171" width="394" height="15" font="1">“Nymeria,” she said. “Only she called me Nan for short.” </text>
<text top="478" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You will call me <i>my lord</i> when you speak to me, Nan,” the lord said mildly. “You are </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">too young to be a Brave Companion, I think, and of the wrong sex. Are you afraid of leeches, </text>
<text top="517" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">child?” </text>
<text top="542" left="171" width="229" height="15" font="1">“They’re only leeches. My lord.” </text>
<text top="567" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My squire could take a lesson from you, it would seem. Frequent leechings are the </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">secret of a long life. A man must purge himself of bad blood. You will do, I think. For so long </text>
<text top="606" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">as I remain at Harrenhal, Nan, you shall be my cupbearer, and serve me at table and in </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">chambers.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">This time she knew better than to say that she’d sooner work in the stables. “Yes, your </text>
<text top="670" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">lord. I mean, my lord.” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The lord waved a hand. “Make her presentable,” he said to no one in particular, “and </text>
<text top="715" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">make certain she knows how to pour wine without spilling it.” Turning away, he lifted a hand </text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">and said, “Lord Hoat, see to those banners above the gatehouse.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Four Brave Companions climbed to the ramparts and hauled down the lion of Lannister </text>
<text top="779" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and Ser Amory’s own black manticore. In their place they raised the flayed man of the </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dreadfort and the direwolf of Stark. And that evening, a page named Nan poured wine for </text>

<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">clung to the legs of his captors, until Rorge pulled him loose, and Shagwell kicked him down </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">into the bear pit. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>The bear is all in black</i>, Arya thought. <i>Like Yoren.</i> She filled Roose Bolton’s cup, and did </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Long and low, without towers or windows, it coiled like a stone serpent through a grove </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of black-barked trees whose inky blue leaves made the stuff of the sorcerous drink the </text>

<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">palace roof, many fallen or broken; the mortar between the stones was dry and crumbling. She </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">understood now why Xaro Xhoan Daxos called it the Palace of Dust. Even Drogon seemed </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">disquieted by the sight of it. The black dragon <i>hissed</i>, smoke seeping out between his sharp </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">teeth. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Blood of my blood,” Jhogo said in Dothraki, “this is an evil place, a haunt of ghosts and </text>

<text top="291" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah Mormont came up beside them. “What power can they have if they live in </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="5"><i>that?</i>” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Heed the wisdom of those who love you best,” said Xaro Xhoan Daxos, lounging inside </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the palanquin. “Warlocks are bitter creatures who eat dust and drink of shadows. They will </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">give you naught. They have naught to give.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Aggo put a hand on his <i>arakh</i>. “<i>Khaleesi</i>, it is said that many go into the Palace of Dust, </text>

<text top="444" left="171" width="179" height="15" font="1">“It is said,” Jhogo agreed. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“We are blood of your blood,” said Aggo, “sworn to live and die as you do. Let us walk </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="392" height="15" font="1">with you in this dark place, to keep you safe from harm.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="382" height="15" font="1">“Some places even a <i>khal</i> must walk alone,” Dany said. </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="327" height="15" font="1">“Take me, then,” Ser Jorah urged. “The risk—” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Queen Daenerys must enter alone, or not at all.” The warlock Pyat Pree stepped out </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from under the trees. <i>Has he been there all along?</i> Dany wondered. “Should she turn away </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="428" height="15" font="1">now, the doors of wisdom shall be closed to her forevermore.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My pleasure barge awaits, even now,” Xaro Xhoan Daxos called out. “Turn away from </text>

<text top="692" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah Mormont gave the merchant prince a sour look. “Your Grace, remember Mirri </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">Maz Duur.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I do,” Dany said, suddenly decided. “I remember that she had knowledge. And she was </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">only a <i>maegi</i>.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Pyat Pree smiled thinly. “The child speaks as sagely as a crone. Take my arm, and let me </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">lead you.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">“I am no child.” Dany took his arm nonetheless. </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">It was darker than she would have thought under the black trees, and the way was longer. </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Though the path seemed to run straight from the street to the door of the palace, Pyat Pree </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">soon turned aside. When she questioned him, the warlock said only, “The front way leads in, </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">but never out again. Heed my words, my queen. The House of the Undying Ones was not </text>

<text top="954" left="171" width="268" height="15" font="1">“I will do as you say,” Dany promised. </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“When you enter, you will find yourself in a room with four doors: the one you have </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">come through and three others. Take the door to your right. Each time, the door to your right. </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">If you should come upon a stairwell, climb. Never go down, and never take any door but the </text>

<text top="1063" left="171" width="602" height="15" font="1">“The door to my right,” Dany repeated. “I understand. And when I leave, the opposite?” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“By no means,” Pyat Pree said. “Leaving and coming, it is the same. Always up. Always </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">disturb you. Visions of loveliness and visions of horror, wonders and terrors. Sights and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sounds of days gone by and days to come and days that never were. Dwellers and servitors </text>

<text top="227" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“I understand.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When you come to the chamber of the Undying, be patient. Our little lives are no more </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When they reached the door—a tall oval mouth, set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a human face—the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold. He stood </text>

<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">delicate livery of purple and blue, and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray. Upon it rested a </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid: <i>shade of the evening</i>, the wine of warlocks. </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="1">“Take and drink,” urged Pyat Pree. </text>
<text top="419" left="171" width="190" height="15" font="1">“Will it turn my lips blue?” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“One flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes, </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you.” </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany raised the glass to her lips. The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue was a taste </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">like honey and anise and cream, like mother’s milk and Drogo’s seed, like red meat and hot </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blood and molten gold. It was all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them . . . and </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">then the glass was empty. </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Now you may enter,” said the warlock. Dany put the glass back on the servitor’s tray, </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">and went inside. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She found herself in a stone anteroom with four doors, one on each wall. With never a </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hesitation, she went to the door on her right and stepped through. The second room was a twin </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to the first. Again she turned to the right-hand door. When she pushed it open she faced yet </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">another small antechamber with four doors. <i>I am in the presence of sorcery.</i> </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The fourth room was oval rather than square and walled in worm-eaten wood in place of </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stone. Six passages led out from it in place of four. Dany chose the rightmost, and entered a </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">long, dim, high-ceilinged hall. Along the right hand was a row of torches burning with a </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smoky orange light, but the only doors were to her left. Drogon unfolded wide black wings </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and beat the stale air. He flew twenty feet before thudding to an undignified crash. Dany </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="116" height="15" font="1">strode after him. </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The mold-eaten carpet under her feet had once been gorgeously colored, and whorls of </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gold could still be seen in the fabric, glinting broken amidst the faded grey and mottled green. </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">What remained served to muffle her footfalls, but that was not all to the good. Dany could </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hear sounds within the walls, a faint scurrying and scrabbling that made her think of rats. </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Drogon heard them too. His head moved as he followed the sounds, and when they stopped he </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gave an angry scream. Other sounds, even more disturbing, came through some of the closed </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">doors. One shook and thumped, as if someone were trying to break through. From another </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">came a dissonant piping that made the dragon lash his tail wildly from side to side. Dany </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="1">hurried quickly past. </text>
<text top="1042" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Not all the doors were closed. <i>I will not look</i>, Dany told herself, but the temptation was </text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="77" height="15" font="1">too strong. </text>

<page number="373" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">In one room, a beautiful woman sprawled naked on the floor while four little men </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">crawled over her. They had rattish pointed faces and tiny pink hands, like the servitor who </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had brought her the glass of shade. One was pumping between her thighs. Another savaged </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="553" height="15" font="1">her breasts, worrying at the nipples with his wet red mouth, tearing and chewing. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Farther on she came upon a feast of corpses. Savagely slaughtered, the feasters lay </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">strewn across overturned chairs and hacked trestle tables, asprawl in pools of congealing </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">blood. Some had lost limbs, even heads. Severed hands clutched bloody cups, wooden </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">spoons, roast fowl, heels of bread. In a throne above them sat a dead man with the head of a </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wolf. He wore an iron crown and held a leg of lamb in one hand as a king might hold a </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">scepter, and his eyes followed Dany with mute appeal. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She fled from him, but only as far as the next open door. <i>I know this room</i>, she thought. </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She remembered those great wooden beams and the carved animal faces that adorned them. </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">And there outside the window, a lemon tree! The sight of it made her heart ache with longing. </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>It is the house with the red door, the house in Braavos.</i> No sooner had she thought it than old </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ser Willem came into the room, leaning heavily on his stick. “Little princess, there you are,” </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he said in his gruff kind voice. “Come,” he said, “come to me, my lady, you’re home now, </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">you’re safe now.” His big wrinkled hand reached for her, soft as old leather, and Dany wanted </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to take it and hold it and kiss it, she wanted that as much as she had ever wanted anything. </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Her foot edged forward, and then she thought, <i>He’s dead, he’s dead, the sweet old bear, he </i></text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="328" height="15" font="5"><i>died a long time ago.</i> She backed away and ran. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The long hall went on and on and on, with endless doors to her left and only torches to </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her right. She ran past more doors than she could count, closed doors and open ones, doors of </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wood and doors of iron, carved doors and plain ones, doors with pulls and doors with locks </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and doors with knockers. Drogon lashed against her back, urging her on, and Dany ran until </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">she could run no more. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Finally a great pair of bronze doors appeared to her left, grander than the rest. They </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">swung open as she neared, and she had to stop and look. Beyond loomed a cavernous stone </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hall, the largest she had ever seen. The skulls of dead dragons looked down from its walls. </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Upon a towering barbed throne sat an old man in rich robes, an old man with dark eyes and </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">long silver-grey hair. “Let him be king over charred bones and cooked meat,” he said to a man </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">below him. “Let him be the king of ashes.” Drogon shrieked, his claws digging through silk </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="476" height="15" font="1">and skin, but the king on his throne never heard, and Dany moved on. </text>
<text top="755" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Viserys</i>, was her first thought the next time she paused, but a second glance told her </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">otherwise. The man had her brother’s hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a dark indigo </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rather than lilac. “Aegon,” he said to a woman nursing a newborn babe in a great wooden bed. </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="217" height="15" font="1">“What better name for a king?” </text>
<text top="839" left="171" width="356" height="15" font="1">“Will you make a song for him?” the woman asked. </text>
<text top="864" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“He has a song,” the man replied. “He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of ice and fire.” He looked up when he said it and his eyes met Dany’s, and it seemed as if he </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">saw her standing there beyond the door. “There must be one more,” he said, though whether </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he was speaking to her or the woman in the bed she could not say. “The dragon has three </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">heads.” He went to the window seat, picked up a harp, and ran his fingers lightly over its </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">silvery strings. Sweet sadness filled the room as man and wife and babe faded like the </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="489" height="15" font="1">morning mist, only the music lingering behind to speed her on her way. </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It seemed as though she walked for another hour before the long hall finally ended in a </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steep stone stair, descending into darkness. Every door, open or closed, had been to her left. </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dany looked back behind her. The torches were going out, she realized with a start of fear. </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Perhaps twenty still burned. Thirty at most. One more guttered out even as she watched, and </text>
</page>
<page number="374" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the darkness came a little farther down the hall, creeping toward her. And as she listened it </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seemed as if she heard something else coming, shuffling and dragging itself slowly along the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">faded carpet. Terror filled her. She could not go back and she was afraid to stay here, but how </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="563" height="15" font="1">could she go on? There was no door on her right, and the steps went down, not up. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yet another torch went out as she stood pondering, and the sounds grew faintly louder. </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Drogon’s long neck snaked out and he opened his mouth to scream, steam rising from </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">between his teeth. <i>He hears it too.</i> Dany turned to the blank wall once more, but there was </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nothing. <i>Could there be a secret door, a door I cannot see?</i> Another torch went out. Another. </text>
<text top="266" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>The first door on the right, he said, always the first door on the right. The first door on the </i></text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="5"><i>right . . .</i> </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="376" height="15" font="1">It came to her suddenly. <i>. . . is the last door on the left!</i> </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She flung herself through. Beyond was another small room with four doors. To the right </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she went, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, and to the right, </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">and to the right, until she was dizzy and out of breath once more. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she stopped, she found herself in yet another dank stone chamber . . . but this time </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the door opposite was round, shaped like an open mouth, and Pyat Pree stood outside in the </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grass beneath the trees. “Can it be that the Undying are done with you so soon?” he asked in </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="184" height="15" font="1">disbelief when he saw her. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="553" height="15" font="1">“So soon?” she said, confused. “I’ve walked for hours, and still not found them.” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="591" height="15" font="1">“You have taken a wrong turning. Come, I will lead you.” Pyat Pree held out his hand. </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="417" height="15" font="1">Dany hesitated. There was a door to her right, still closed . . . </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“That’s not the way,” Pyat Pree said firmly, his blue lips prim with disapproval. “The </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">Undying Ones will not wait forever.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Our little lives are no more than a flicker of a moth’s wing to them,” Dany said, </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="1">remembering. </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">“Stubborn child. You will be lost, and never found.” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">She walked away from him, to the door on the right. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No,” Pyat screeched. “No, to me, come to me, to <i>meeeeeee</i>.” His face crumbled inward, </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">changing to something pale and wormlike. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany left him behind, entering a stairwell. She began to climb. Before long her legs were </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="601" height="15" font="1">aching. She recalled that the House of the Undying Ones had seemed to have no towers. </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Finally the stair opened. To her right, a set of wide wooden doors had been thrown open. </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">They were fashioned of ebony and weirwood, the black and white grains swirling and twisting </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in strange interwoven patterns. They were very beautiful, yet somehow frightening. <i>The blood </i></text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>of the dragon must not be afraid.</i> Dany said a quick prayer, begging the Warrior for courage </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="496" height="15" font="1">and the Dothraki horse god for strength. She made herself walk forward. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Beyond the doors was a great hall and a splendor of wizards. Some wore sumptuous </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">robes of ermine, ruby velvet, and cloth of gold. Others fancied elaborate armor studded with </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gemstones, or tall pointed hats speckled with stars. There were women among them, dressed </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">in gowns of surpassing loveliness. Shafts of sunlight slanted through windows of stained </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">glass, and the air was alive with the most beautiful music she had ever heard. </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">A kingly man in rich robes rose when he saw her, and smiled. “Daenerys of House </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="631" height="15" font="1">Targaryen, be welcome. Come and share the food of forever. We are the Undying of Qarth.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Long have we awaited you,” said a woman beside him, clad in rose and silver. The </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">breast she had left bare in the Qartheen fashion was as perfect as a breast could be. </text>
</page>
<page number="375" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We knew you were to come to us,” the wizard king said. “A thousand years ago we </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">knew, and have been waiting all this time. We sent the comet to show you the way.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We have knowledge to share with you,” said a warrior in shining emerald armor, “and </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">magic weapons to arm you with. You have passed every trial. Now come and sit with us, and </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">all your questions shall be answered.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She took a step forward. But then Drogon leapt from her shoulder. He flew to the top of </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">the ebony-and-weirwood door, perched there, and began to bite at the carved wood. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A willful beast,” laughed a handsome young man. “Shall we teach you the secret speech </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="1">of dragonkind? Come, come.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Doubt seized her. The great door was so heavy it took all of Dany’s strength to budge it, </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but finally it began to move. Behind was another door, hidden. It was old grey wood, splintery </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and plain . . . but it stood to the right of the door through which she’d entered. The wizards </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were beckoning her with voices sweeter than song. She ran from them, Drogon flying back </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="565" height="15" font="1">down to her. Through the narrow door she passed, into a chamber awash in gloom. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A long stone table filled this room. Above it floated a human heart, swollen and blue </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with corruption, yet still alive. It beat, a deep ponderous throb of sound, and each pulse sent </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">out a wash of indigo light. The figures around the table were no more than blue shadows. As </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dany walked to the empty chair at the foot of the table, they did not stir, nor speak, nor turn to </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="498" height="15" font="1">face her. There was no sound but the slow, deep beat of the rotting heart. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="218" height="15" font="5"><i>. . . mother  of  dragons . . .</i> </text>
<text top="508" left="376" width="386" height="15" font="1">came a voice, part whisper and part moan </text>
<text top="508" left="749" width="21" height="15" font="1">. </text>
<text top="508" left="758" width="26" height="15" font="5"><i>. . . </i></text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>dragons . . . dragons . . . dragons . . . </i>other voices echoed in the gloom. Some were male and </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">some female. One spoke with the timbre of a child. The floating heart pulsed from dimness to </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">darkness. It was hard to summon the will to speak, to recall the words she had practiced so </text>

<text top="149" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thanks to Cersei, but only a quarter of them could be relied upon. “There’s few out-and-out </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">traitors, though there’s some, even your spider hasn’t found them all,” Bywater had warned </text>

<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">To be sure, there were seasoned men in the City Watch, the core of two thousand who’d </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">gotten their gold cloaks from Robert, not Cersei. Yet even those . . . a watchman was not truly </text>

<text top="394" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Bronn and the escort were waiting at the foot of the quay, amidst swarming beggars, </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">strolling whores, and fishwives crying the catch. The fishwives did more business than all the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">rest combined. Buyers flocked around the barrels and stalls to haggle over winkles, clams, and </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">river pike. With no other food coming into the city, the price of fish was ten times what it had </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been before the war, and still rising. Those who had coin came to the riverfront each morning </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and each evening, in hopes of bringing home an eel or a pot of red crabs; those who did not </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="593" height="15" font="1">slipped between the stalls hoping to steal, or stood gaunt and forlorn beneath the walls. </text>

<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their spears. Tyrion ignored the muttered curses as best he could. A fish came sailing out of </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the crowd, slimy and rotten. It landed at his feet and flew to pieces. He stepped over it </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gingerly and climbed into his saddle. Children with swollen bellies were already fighting over </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">pieces of the stinking fish. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Mounted, he gazed along the riverfront. Hammers rang in the morning air as carpenters </text>

<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thick. Though perhaps it did not matter. Massive walls and tall towers had not saved Storm’s </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He remembered Winterfell as he had last seen it. Not as grotesquely huge as Harrenhal, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nor as solid and impregnable to look at as Storm’s End, yet there had been a great strength in </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">those stones, a sense that within those walls a man might feel safe. The news of the castle’s </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fall had come as a wrenching shock. “The gods give with one hand and take with the other,” </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he muttered under his breath when Varys told him. They had given the Starks Harrenhal and </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">taken Winterfell, a dismal exchange. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No doubt he should be rejoicing. Robb Stark would have to turn north now. If he could </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not defend his own home and hearth, he was no sort of king at all. It meant reprieve for the </text>

<text top="424" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had only the vaguest memory of Theon Greyjoy from his time with the Starks. A </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">callow youth, always smiling, skilled with a bow; it was hard to imagine him as Lord of </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="412" height="15" font="1">Winterfell. The Lord of Winterfell would always be a Stark. </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He remembered their godswood; the tall sentinels armored in their grey-green needles, </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the great oaks, the hawthorn and ash and soldier pines, and at the center the heart tree standing </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like some pale giant frozen in time. He could almost smell the place, earthy and brooding, the </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smell of centuries, and he remembered how dark the wood had been even by day. <i>That wood </i></text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>was Winterfell. It was the north. I never felt so out of place as I did when I walked there, so </i></text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>much an unwelcome intruder.</i> He wondered if the Greyjoys would feel it too. The castle might </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">well be theirs, but never that godswood. Not in a year, or ten, or fifty. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion Lannister walked his horse slowly toward the Mud Gate. <i>Winterfell is nothing to </i></text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>you</i>, he reminded himself. <i>Be glad the place has fallen, and look to your own walls.</i> The gate </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was open. Inside, three great trebuchets stood side by side in the market square, peering over </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the battlements like three huge birds. Their throwing arms were made from the trunks of old </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">oaks, and banded with iron to keep them from splitting. The gold cloaks had named them the </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">Three Whores, because they’d be giving Lord Stannis such a lusty welcome. <i>Or so we hope.</i> </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Tyrion put his heels into his horse and trotted through the Mud Gate, breasting the human </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="623" height="15" font="1">tide. Once beyond the Whores, the press grew thinner and the street opened up around him. </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The ride back to the Red Keep was uneventful, but at the Tower of the Hand he found a </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">dozen angry trader captains waiting in his audience chamber to protest the seizure of their </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ships. He gave them a sincere apology and promised compensation once the war was done. </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">That did little to appease them. “What if you should lose, my lord?” one Braavosi asked. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“Then apply to King Stannis for your compensation.” </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By the time he rid himself of them, bells were ringing and Tyrion knew he would be late </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for the installation. He waddled across the yard almost at a run and crowded into the back of </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the castle sept as Joffrey fastened white silk cloaks about the shoulders of the two newest </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">members of his Kingsguard. The rite seemed to require that everyone stand, so Tyrion saw </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nothing but a wall of courtly arses. On the other hand, once the new High Septon was finished </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">leading the two knights through their solemn vows and anointing them in the names of the </text>

<text top="1048" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He approved of his sister’s choice of Ser Balon Swann to take the place of the slain </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Landing. If he’d had a third son, Tyrion suspected he’d be off with Robb Stark. It was not </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">perhaps the most honorable course, but it showed good sense; whoever won the Iron Throne, </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Swanns intended to survive. In addition to being well-born, young Ser Balon was valiant, </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">courtly, and skilled at arms; good with a lance, better with a morningstar, superb with the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">bow. He would serve with honor and courage. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Alas, Tyrion could not say the same for Cersei’s second choice. Ser Osmund Kettleblack </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>looked</i> formidable enough. He stood six feet and six inches, most of it sinew and muscle, and </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his hook nose, bushy eyebrows, and spade-shaped brown beard gave his face a fierce aspect, </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">so long as he did not smile. Lowborn, no more than a hedge knight, Kettleblack was utterly </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dependent on Cersei for his advancement, which was doubtless why she’d picked him. “Ser </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Osmund is as loyal as he is brave,” she’d told Joffrey when she put forward his name. It was </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">true, unfortunately. The good Ser Osmund had been selling her secrets to Bronn since the day </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="378" height="15" font="1">she’d hired him, but Tyrion could scarcely <i>tell</i> her that. </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He supposed he ought not complain. The appointment gave him another ear close to the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">king, unbeknownst to his sister. And even if Ser Osmund proved an utter craven, he would be </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">no worse than Ser Boros Blount, currently residing in a dungeon at Rosby. Ser Boros had </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">been escorting Tommen and Lord Gyles when Ser Jacelyn Bywater and his gold cloaks had </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">surprised them, and had yielded up his charge with an alacrity that would have enraged old </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ser Barristan Selmy as much as it did Cersei; a knight of the Kingsguard was supposed to die </text>
<text top="524" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in defense of the king and royal family. His sister had insisted that Joffrey strip Blount of his </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">white cloak on the grounds of treason and cowardice. <i>And now she replaces him with another </i></text>
<text top="563" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="5"><i>man just as hollow.</i> </text>
<text top="588" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The praying, vowing, and anointing seemed to take most of the morning. Tyrion’s legs </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">soon began to ache. He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, restless. Lady Tanda </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stood several rows up, he saw, but her daughter was not with her. He had been half hoping to </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">catch a glimpse of Shae. Varys said she was doing well, but he would prefer to see for </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">himself. </text>
<text top="691" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Better a lady’s maid than a pot girl,” Shae had said when Tyrion told her the eunuch’s </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scheme. “Can I take my belt of silver flowers and my gold collar with the black diamonds you </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">said looked like my eyes? I won’t wear them if you say I shouldn’t.” </text>
<text top="755" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Loath as he was to disappoint her, Tyrion had to point out that while Lady Tanda was by </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">no means a clever woman, even she might wonder if her daughter’s bedmaid seemed to own </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">more jewelry than her daughter. “Choose two or three dresses, no more,” he commanded her. </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Good wool, no silk, no samite, and no fur. The rest I’ll keep in my own chambers for when </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="542" height="15" font="1">you visit me.” It was not the answer Shae had wanted, but at least she was safe. </text>
<text top="858" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When the investiture was finally done Joffrey marched out between Ser Balon and Ser </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Osmund in their new white cloaks, while Tyrion lingered for a word with the new High </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Septon (who was <i>his</i> choice, and wise enough to know who put the honey on his bread). “I </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">want the gods on our side,” Tyrion told him bluntly. “Tell them that Stannis has vowed to </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="216" height="15" font="1">burn the Great Sept of Baelor.” </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Is it true, my lord?” asked the High Septon, a small, shrewd man with a wispy white </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="168" height="15" font="1">beard and wizened face. </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion shrugged. “It may be. Stannis burned the godswood at Storm’s End as an offering </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to the Lord of Light. If he’d offend the old gods, why should he spare the new? Tell them that. </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Tell them that any man who thinks to give aid to the usurper betrays the gods as well as his </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I shall, my lord. And I shall command them to pray for the health of the king and his </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Hallyne the Pyromancer was waiting on him when Tyrion returned to his solar, and </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Maester Frenken had brought messages. He let the alchemist wait a little longer while he read </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">what the ravens had brought him. There was an old letter from Doran Martell, warning him </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that Storm’s End had fallen, and a much more intriguing one from Balon Greyjoy on Pyke, </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">who styled himself <i>King of the Isles and the North</i>. He invited King Joffrey to send an envoy </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">to the Iron Islands to fix the borders between their realms and discuss a possible alliance. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion read the letter three times and set it aside. Lord Balon’s longships would have </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">been a great help against the fleet sailing up from Storm’s End, but they were thousands of </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">leagues away on the wrong side of Westeros, and Tyrion was far from certain that he wanted </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to give away half the realm. <i>Perhaps I should spill this one in Cersei’s lap, or take it to the </i></text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="5"><i>council.</i> </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Only then did he admit Hallyne with the latest tallies from the alchemists. “This cannot </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">be true,” said Tyrion as he pored over the ledgers. “Almost thirteen thousand jars? Do you </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">take me for a fool? I’m not about to pay the king’s gold for empty jars and pots of sewage </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">sealed with wax, I warn you.” </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No, no,” Hallyne squeaked, “the sums are accurate, I swear. We have been, hmmm, </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">most fortunate, my lord Hand. Another cache of Lord Rossart’s was found, more than three </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hundred jars. Under the Dragonpit! Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">patrons, and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a cellar. When he felt the </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">jars, he mistook them for wine. He was so drunk he broke the seal and drank some.” </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There was a prince who tried that once,” said Tyrion dryly. “I haven’t seen any dragons </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rising over the city, so it would seem it didn’t work this time either.” The Dragonpit atop the </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hill of Rhaenys had been abandoned for a century and a half. He supposed it was as good a </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">place as any to store wildfire, and better than most, but it would have been nice if the late </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lord Rossart had told someone. “Three hundred jars, you say? That still does not account for </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">these totals. You are several thousand jars ahead of the best estimate you gave me when last </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">we met.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“Yes, yes, that’s so.” Hallyne mopped at his pale brow with the sleeve of his black-and-</text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="495" height="15" font="1">scarlet robe. “We have been working very hard, my lord Hand, hmmm.” </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That would doubtless explain why you are making so much more of the substance than </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">before.” Smiling, Tyrion fixed the pyromancer with his mismatched stare. “Though it does </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">raise the question of why you did not begin working hard until now.” </text>
<text top="811" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hallyne had the complexion of a mushroom, so it was hard to see how he could turn any </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">paler, yet somehow he managed. “We <i>were</i>, my lord Hand, my brothers and I have been </text>

<text top="291" left="139" width="208" height="15" font="1">discussing the city’s defenses. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Prince Tommen is hale and happy, my lord. He has adopted a fawn some of my men </text>

<text top="500" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">That made him smile. “I’m pleased you remember.” Should King’s Landing fall, he </text>

<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Varys appeared not long after Lord Jacelyn had left. “Men are such faithless creatures,” </text>

<text top="659" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My father is not dead yet.” Tyrion scanned the list. “I know some of these names. These </text>

<text top="990" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He could hear her breathing, soft and steady. The sheet was tangled about them. It was the </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="348" height="15" font="1">black of night. The bedchamber was dark and still. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Wind sighed faintly against the shutters. Somewhere, far off, he heard the yowl of a cat </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">in heat. Nothing else. <i>Sleep, Greyjoy</i>, he told himself. <i>The castle is quiet, and you have guards </i></text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="339" height="15" font="5"><i>posted. At your door, at the gates, on the armory.</i> </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He might have put it down to a bad dream, but he did not remember dreaming. Kyra had </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">worn him out. Until Theon had sent for her, she had lived all of her eighteen years in the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">winter town without ever setting foot inside the walls of the castle. She came to him wet and </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">eager and lithe as a weasel, and there had been a certain undeniable spice to fucking a </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="385" height="15" font="1">common tavern wench in Lord Eddard Stark’s own bed. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She murmured sleepily as Theon slid out from under her arm and got to his feet. A few </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">embers still smoldered in the hearth. Wex slept on the floor at the foot of the bed, rolled up </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">inside his cloak and dead to the world. Nothing moved. Theon crossed to the window and </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">threw open the shutters. Night touched him with cold fingers, and gooseprickles rose on his </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bare skin. He leaned against the stone sill and looked out on dark towers, empty yards, black </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sky, and more stars than a man could ever count if he lived to be a hundred. A half-moon </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">floated above the Bell Tower and cast its reflection on the roof of the glass gardens. He heard </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="323" height="15" font="1">no alarms, no voices, not so much as a footfall. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>All’s well, Greyjoy. Hear the quiet? You ought to be drunk with joy. You took Winterfell </i></text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>with fewer than thirty men, a feat to sing of.</i> Theon started back to bed. He’d roll Kyra on her </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back and fuck her again, that ought to banish these phantoms. Her gasps and giggles would </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="289" height="15" font="1">make a welcome respite from this silence. </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He stopped. He had grown so used to the howling of the direwolves that he scarcely </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">heard it anymore . . . but some part of him, some hunter’s instinct, heard its absence. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Urzen stood outside his door, a sinewy man with a round shield slung over his back. </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">“The wolves are quiet,” Theon told him. “Go see what they’re doing, and come straight </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">back.” The thought of the direwolves running loose gave him a queasy feeling. He </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">remembered the day in the wolfswood when the wildlings had attacked Bran. Summer and </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">Grey Wind had torn them to pieces. </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When he prodded Wex with the toe of his boot, the boy sat up and rubbed his eyes. </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">“Make certain Bran Stark and his little brother are in their beds, and be quick about it.” </text>
<text top="708" left="171" width="219" height="15" font="1">“M’lord?” Kyra called sleepily. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Go back to sleep, this does not concern you.” Theon poured himself a cup of wine and </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drank it down. All the time he was listening, hoping to hear a howl. <i>Too few men</i>, he thought </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">sourly. <i>I have too few men. If Asha does not come . . .</i> </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Wex returned the quickest, shaking his head side to side. Cursing, Theon found his tunic </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and breeches on the floor where he had dropped them in his haste to get at Kyra. Over the </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tunic he donned a jerkin of iron-studded leather, and he belted a longsword and dagger at his </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="444" height="15" font="1">waist. His hair was wild as the wood, but he had larger concerns. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">By then Urzen was back. “The wolves be gone.” </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon told himself he must be as cold and deliberate as Lord Eddard. “Rouse the castle,” </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he said. “Herd them out into the yard, everyone, we’ll see who’s missing. And have Lorren </text>

<text top="970" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He wondered if Stygg had reached Deepwood Motte yet. The man was not as skilled a </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rider as he claimed—none of the ironmen were much good in the saddle—but there’d been </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Bran’s bedchamber was empty, as was Rickon’s half a turn below. Theon cursed himself. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">He should have kept a guard on them, but he’d deemed it more important to have men </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">walking the walls and protecting the gates than to nursemaid a couple of children, one a </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="55" height="15" font="1">cripple. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Outside he heard sobbing as the castle folk were pulled from their beds and driven into </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the yard. <i>I’ll give them reason to sob. I’ve used them gently, and this is how they repay me.</i> </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He’d even had two of his own men whipped bloody for raping that kennel girl, to show them </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he meant to be just. <i>They still blame me for the rape, though. And the rest.</i> He deemed that </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">unfair. Mikken had killed himself with his mouth, just as Benfred had. As for Chayle, he had </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to give <i>someone</i> to the Drowned God, his men expected it. “I bear you no ill-will,” he’d told </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the septon before they threw him down the well, “but you and your gods have no place here </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">now.” You’d think the others might be grateful he hadn’t chosen one of them, but no. He </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="435" height="15" font="1">wondered how many of them were part of this plot against him. </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="595" height="15" font="1">Urzen returned with Black Lorren. “The Hunter’s Gate,” Lorren said. “Best come see.” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Hunter’s Gate was conveniently sited close to the kennels and kitchens. It opened </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">directly on fields and forests, allowing riders to come and go without first passing through the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">winter town, and so was favored by hunting parties. “Who had the guard here?” Theon </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">demanded. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="159" height="15" font="1">“Drennan and Squint.” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Drennan was one of the men who’d raped Palla. “If they’ve let the boys escape, I’ll have </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="394" height="15" font="1">more than a little skin off their back this time, I swear it.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“No need for that,” Black Lorren said curtly. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Nor was there. They found Squint floating facedown in the moat, his entrails drifting </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">behind him like a nest of pale snakes. Drennan lay half naked in the gatehouse, in the snug </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">room where the drawbridge was worked. His throat had been opened ear to ear. A ragged </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">tunic concealed the half-healed scars on his back, but his boots were scattered amidst the </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rushes, and his breeches tangled about his feet. There was cheese on a small table near the </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="308" height="15" font="1">door, beside an empty flagon. And two cups. </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon picked one up and sniffed at the dregs of wine in the bottom. “Squint was up on </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="1">the wallwalk, no?” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="138" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” said Lorren. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon flung the cup into the hearth. “I’d say Drennan was pulling down his breeches to </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stick it in the woman when she stuck it in him. His own cheese knife, by the look of it. </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">Someone find a pike and fish the other fool out of the moat.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The other fool was in a deal worse shape than Drennan. When Black Lorren drew him </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">out of the water, they saw that one of his arms had been wrenched off at the elbow, half of his </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">neck was missing, and there was a ragged hole where his navel and groin once had been. The </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="556" height="15" font="1">pike tore through his bowels as Lorren was pulling him in. The stench was awful. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The direwolves,” Theon said. “Both of them, at a guess.” Disgusted, he walked back to </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the drawbridge. Winterfell was encircled by two massive granite walls, with a wide moat </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">between them. The outer wall stood eighty feet high, the inner more than a hundred. Lacking </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">men, Theon had been forced to abandon the outer defenses and post his guards along the </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">higher inner walls. He dared not risk having them on the wrong side of the moat should the </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">castle rise against him. </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>There had to be two or more</i>, he decided. <i>While the woman was entertaining Drennan, </i></text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon called for a torch and led them up the steps to the wallwalk. He swept the flame </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">low before him, looking for . . . <i>there</i>. On the inside of the rampart and in the wide crenel </text>

<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">have a look, and got this far. They pushed the corpse through the crenel into the moat so he </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="263" height="15" font="1">wouldn’t be found by another sentry.” </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Urzen peered along the walls. “The other watch turrets are not far. I see torches </text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Torches, but no guards,” Theon said testily. “Winterfell has more turrets than I have </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">men.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Four guards at the main gate,” said Black Lorren, “and five walking the walls beside </text>

<text top="360" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">Urzen said, “If he had sounded his horn—” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>I am served by fools.</i> “Try and imagine it was you up here, Urzen. It’s dark and cold. You </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have been walking sentry for hours, looking forward to the end of your watch. Then you hear </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a noise and move toward the gate, and suddenly you see eyes at the top of the stair, glowing </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">green and gold in the torchlight. Two shadows come rushing toward you faster than you can </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">believe. You catch a glimpse of teeth, start to level your spear, and they slam into you and </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">open your belly, tearing through leather as if it were cheesecloth.” He gave Urzen a hard </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shove. “And now you’re down on your back, your guts are spilling out, and one of them has </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his teeth around your neck.” Theon grabbed the man’s scrawny throat, tightened his fingers, </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and smiled. “Tell me, at what moment during all of this do you stop to <i>blow your fucking </i></text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>horn?</i>” He shoved Urzen away roughly, sending him stumbling back against a merlon. The </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man rubbed his throat. <i>I should have had those beasts put down the day we took the castle</i>, he </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">thought angrily. <i>I’d seen them kill, I knew how dangerous they were.</i> </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="309" height="15" font="1">“We must go after them,” Black Lorren said. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Not in the dark.” Theon did not relish the idea of chasing direwolves through the wood </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">by night; the hunters could easily become the hunted. “We’ll wait for daylight. Until then, I </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">had best go speak with my loyal subjects.” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Down in the yard, a uneasy crowd of men, women, and children had been pushed up </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">against the wall. Many had not been given time to dress; they covered themselves with </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">woolen blankets, or huddled naked under cloaks or bed-robes. A dozen ironmen hemmed </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">them in, torches in one hand and weapons in the other. The wind was gusting, and the </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="596" height="15" font="1">flickering orange light reflected dully off steel helms, thick beards, and unsmiling eyes. </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Theon walked up and down before the prisoners, studying the faces. They <i>all</i> looked </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="280" height="15" font="1">guilty to him. “How many are missing?” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Six.” Reek stepped up behind him, smelling of soap, his long hair moving in the wind. </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">“Both Starks, that bog boy and his sister, the halfwit from the stables, and your wildling </text>

<text top="926" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Osha.</i> He had suspected her from the moment he saw that second cup. <i>I should have </i></text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>known better than to trust that one. She’s as unnatural as Asha. Even their names sound alike.</i> </text>
<text top="970" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“Has anyone had a look at the stables?” </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="250" height="15" font="1">“Aggar says no horses are missing.” </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="195" height="15" font="1">“Dancer is still in his stall?” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Dancer?” Reek frowned. “Aggar says the horses are all there. Only the halfwit is </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>They’re afoot, then.</i> That was the best news he’d heard since he woke. Bran would be </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">riding in his basket on Hodor’s back, no doubt. Osha would need to carry Rickon; his little </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">legs wouldn’t take him far on their own. Theon was confident that he’d soon have them back </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in his hands. “Bran and Rickon have fled,” he told the castle folk, watching their eyes. “Who </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knows where they’ve gone?” No one answered. “They could not have escaped without help,” </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon went on. “Without food, clothing, weapons.” He had locked away every sword and axe </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in Winterfell, but no doubt some had been hidden from him. “I’ll have the names of all those </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">who aided them. All those who turned a blind eye.” The only sound was the wind. “Come </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">first light, I mean to bring them back.” He hooked his thumbs through his swordbelt. “I need </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">huntsmen. Who wants a nice warm wolfskin to see them through the winter? Gage?” The </text>
<text top="299" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cook had always greeted him cheerfully when he returned from the hunt, to ask whether he’d </text>
<text top="318" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brought anything choice for the table, but he had nothing to say now. Theon walked back the </text>
<text top="338" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">way he had come, searching their faces for the least sign of guilty knowledge. “The wild is no </text>
<text top="357" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">place for a cripple. And Rickon, young as he is, how long will he last out there? Nan, think </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">how frightened he must be.” The old woman had nattered at him for ten years, telling her </text>
<text top="396" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">endless stories, but now she gaped at him as if he were some stranger. “I might have killed </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">every man of you and given your women to my soldiers for their pleasure, but instead I </text>
<text top="435" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">protected you. Is this the thanks you offer?” Joseth who’d groomed his horses, Farlen who’d </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">taught him all he knew of hounds, Barth the brewer’s wife who’d been his first—not one of </text>
<text top="474" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">them would meet his eyes. <i>They hate me</i>, he realized. </text>
<text top="499" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Reek stepped close. “Strip off their skins,” he urged, his thick lips glistening. “Lord </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="1">Bolton, he used to say a naked man has few secrets, but a flayed man’s got none.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The flayed man was the sigil of House Bolton, Theon knew; ages past, certain of their </text>
<text top="563" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">lords had gone so far as to cloak themselves in the skins of dead enemies. A number of Starks </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had ended thus. Supposedly all that had stopped a thousand years ago, when the Boltons had </text>
<text top="602" left="139" width="574" height="15" font="1">bent their knees to Winterfell. <i>Or so they say, but old ways die hard, as well I know.</i> </text>
<text top="627" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There will be no flaying in the north so long as I rule in Winterfell,” Theon said loudly. </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>I am your only protection against the likes of him</i>, he wanted to scream. He could not be that </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">blatant, but perhaps some were clever enough to take the lesson. </text>
<text top="691" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The sky was greying over the castle walls. Dawn could not be far off. “Joseth, saddle </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Smiler and a horse for yourself. Murch, Gariss, Poxy Tym, you’ll come as well.” Murch and </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Gariss were the best huntsmen in the castle, and Tym was a fine bowman. “Aggar, Rednose, </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gelmarr, Reek, Wex.” He needed his own to watch his back. “Farlen, I’ll want hounds, and </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="146" height="15" font="1">you to handle them.” </text>
<text top="794" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The grizzled kennelmaster crossed his arms. “And why would I care to hunt down my </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="270" height="15" font="1">own trueborn lords, and babes at that?” </text>
<text top="839" left="171" width="594" height="15" font="1">Theon moved close. “I am your trueborn lord now, and the man who keeps Palla safe.” </text>
<text top="864" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">He saw the defiance die in Farlen’s eyes. “Aye, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="889" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stepping back, Theon glanced about to see who else he might add. “Maester Luwin,” he </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="82" height="15" font="1">announced. </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="201" height="15" font="1">“I know nothing of hunting.” </text>
<text top="959" left="171" width="592" height="15" font="5"><i>No, but I don’t trust you in the castle in my absence.</i> “Then it’s past time you learned.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Let me come too. I want that wolfskin cloak.” A boy stepped forward, no older than </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Bran. It took Theon a moment to remember him. “I’ve hunted lots of times before,” Walder </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="312" height="15" font="1">Frey said. “Red deer and elk, and even boar.” </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His cousin laughed at him. “He rode on a boar hunt with his father, but they never let him </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon look at the boy doubtfully. “Come if you like, but if you can’t keep up, don’t think </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">that I’ll nurse you along.” He turned back to Black Lorren. “Winterfell is yours in my </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">absence. If we do not return, do with it as you will.” <i>That bloody well ought to have them </i></text>
<text top="163" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="5"><i>praying for my success.</i> </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They assembled by the Hunter’s Gate as the first pale rays of the sun brushed the top of </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Bell Tower, their breath frosting in the cold morning air. Gelmarr had equipped himself </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with a longaxe whose reach would allow him to strike before the wolves were on him. The </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blade was heavy enough to kill with a single blow. Aggar wore steel greaves. Reek arrived </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">carrying a boar spear and an overstuffed washerwoman’s sack bulging with god knows what. </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon had his bow; he needed nothing else. Once he had saved Bran’s life with an arrow. He </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">hoped he would not need to take it with another, but if it came to that, he would. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Eleven men, two boys, and a dozen dogs crossed the moat. Beyond the outer wall, the </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tracks were plain to read in the soft ground; the pawprints of the wolves, Hodor’s heavy tread, </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the shallower marks left by the feet of the two Reeds. Once under the trees, the stony ground </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and fallen leaves made the trail harder to see, but by then Farlen’s red bitch had the scent. The </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rest of the dogs were close behind, the hounds sniffing and barking, a pair of monstrous </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">mastiffs bringing up the rear. Their size and ferocity might make the difference against a </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="129" height="15" font="1">cornered direwolf. </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He’d have guessed that Osha might run south to Ser Rodrik, but the trail led north by </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">northwest, into the very heart of the wolfswood. Theon did not like that one bit. It would be a </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">bitter irony if the Starks made for Deepwood Motte and delivered themselves right into </text>

<text top="575" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Wisps of pale mist threaded between the trees. Sentinels and soldier pines grew thick </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">about here, and there was nothing as dark and gloomy as an evergreen forest. The ground was </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">uneven, and the fallen needles disguised the softness of the turf and made the footing </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">treacherous for the horses, so they had to go slowly. <i>Not as slowly as a man carrying a </i></text>

<text top="697" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin trotted up to him as they were following a game trail along the lip of a </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="627" height="15" font="1">ravine. “Thus far hunting seems indistinguishable from riding through the woods, my lord.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="559" height="15" font="1">Theon smiled. “There are similarities. But with hunting, there’s blood at the end.” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Must it be so? This flight was great folly, but will you not be merciful? These are your </text>

<text top="811" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No Stark but Robb was ever brotherly toward me, but Bran and Rickon have more value </text>

<text top="920" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon had not considered that. In truth, he had scarcely considered the mudmen at all, </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beyond eyeing Meera once or twice and wondering if she was still a maiden. “You may be </text>

<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hodor was nothing to him. “If he does not fight us, we will let him live.” Theon pointed </text>

<text top="310" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The wood grew ever wilder. The pines and sentinels gave way to huge dark oaks. </text>

<text top="510" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">them a few steaks. It made no sense to leave so much good meat to rot. “Farlen, are you </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">certain we’re on the right trail?” he demanded. “Could your dogs be chasing the wrong </text>

<text top="575" left="171" width="451" height="15" font="1">“My bitch knows the smell of Summer and Shaggy well enough.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="187" height="15" font="1">“I hope so. For your sake.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Less than an hour later, the trail led down a slope toward a muddy brook swollen by the </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">recent rains. It was there the dogs lost the scent. Farlen and Wex waded across with the </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hounds and came back shaking their heads while the animals ranged up and down the far </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">bank, sniffing. “They went in here, m’lord, but I can’t see where they come out,” the </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="130" height="15" font="1">kennelmaster said. </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon dismounted and knelt beside the stream. He dipped a hand in it. The water was </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cold. “They won’t have stayed long in this,” he said. “Take half the dogs downstream, I’ll go </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="46" height="15" font="1">up—” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="272" height="15" font="1">Wex clapped his hands together loudly. </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">“What is it?” Theon said. </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="158" height="15" font="1">The mute boy pointed. </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The ground near the water was sodden and muddy. The tracks the wolves had left were </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="249" height="15" font="1">plain enough. “Pawprints, yes. So?” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Wex drove his heel into the mud, and pivoted his foot this way and that. It left a deep </text>

<text top="956" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Joseth understood. “A man the size of Hodor ought to have left a deep print in this mud,” </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he said. “More so with the weight of a boy on his back. Yet the only boot prints here are our </text>

<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Appalled, Theon saw it was true. The wolves had gone into the turgid brown water alone. </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“There’s been only the one trail, my lord, I swear it,” said Gariss defensively. “And the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="465" height="15" font="1">direwolves would never have parted from them boys. Not for long.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>That’s so</i>, Theon thought. Summer and Shaggydog might have gone off to hunt, but soon </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">or late they would return to Bran and Rickon. “Gariss, Murch, take four dogs and double </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back, find where we lost them. Aggar, you watch them, I’ll have no trickery. Farlen and I will </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">follow the direwolves. Give a blast on the horn when you pick up the trail. Two blasts if you </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">catch sight of the beasts themselves. Once we find where they went, they’ll lead us back to </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">their masters.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He took Wex, the Frey boy, and Gynir Rednose to search upstream. He and Wex rode on </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one side of the brook, Rednose and Walder Frey on the other, each with a pair of hounds. The </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wolves might have come out on either bank. Theon kept an eye out for tracks, spoor, broken </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">branches, any hint as to where the direwolves might have left the water. He spied the prints of </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deer, elk, and badger easily enough. Wex surprised a vixen drinking at the stream, and Walder </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flushed three rabbits from the underbrush and managed to put an arrow in one. They saw the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">claw marks where a bear had shredded the bark of a tall birch. But of the direwolves there was </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">no sign. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>A little farther</i>, Theon told himself. <i>Past that oak, over that rise, past the next bend of the </i></text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>stream, we’ll find something there.</i> He pressed on long after he knew he should turn back, a </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">growing sense of anxiety gnawing at his belly. It was midday when he wrenched Smiler’s </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">head round in disgust and gave up. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Somehow Osha and the wretched boys were eluding him. It should not have been </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">possible, not on foot, burdened with a cripple and a young child. Every passing hour increased </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the likelihood that they would make good their escape. <i>If they reach a village . . .</i> The people </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of the north would never deny Ned Stark’s sons, Robb’s brothers. They’d have mounts to </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">speed them on their way, food. Men would fight for the honor of protecting them. The whole </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="267" height="15" font="1">bloody north would rally around them. </text>
<text top="683" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>The wolves went downstream, that’s all.</i> He clung to that thought. <i>That red bitch will </i></text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="471" height="15" font="5"><i>sniff where they came out of the water and we’ll be after them again.</i> </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">But when they joined up with Farlen’s party, one look at the kennelmaster’s face </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">smashed all of Theon’s hopes to shards. “The only thing those dogs are fit for is a bear </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="354" height="15" font="1">baiting,” he said angrily. “Would that I had a bear.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The dogs are not at fault.” Farlen knelt between a mastiff and his precious red bitch, a </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">hand on each. “Running water don’t hold no scents, m’lord.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“The wolves had to come out of the stream <i>somewhere</i>.” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No doubt they did. Upstream or down. We keep on, we’ll find the place, but which </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">way?” </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I never knew a wolf to run up a streambed for miles,” said Reek. “A man might. If he </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="347" height="15" font="1">knew he was being hunted, he might. But a wolf?” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Yet Theon wondered. These beasts were not as other wolves. <i>I should have skinned the </i></text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="5"><i>cursed things.</i> </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was the same tale all over again when they rejoined Gariss, Murch, and Aggar. The </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">huntsmen had retraced their steps halfway to Winterfell without finding any sign of where the </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Starks might have parted company with the direwolves. Farlen’s hounds seemed as frustrated </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">as their masters, sniffing forlornly at trees and rocks and snapping irritably at each other. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon dared not admit defeat. “We’ll return to the brook. Search again. This time we’ll </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">go as far as we must.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We won’t find them,” the Frey boy said suddenly. “Not so long as the frogeaters are </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with them. Mudmen are sneaks, they won’t fight like decent folks, they skulk and use poison </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">arrows, You never see them, but they see you. Those who go into the bogs after them get lost </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and never come out. Their houses <i>move</i>, even the castles like Greywater Watch.” He glanced </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">nervously at greenery that encircled them on all sides. “They might be out there right now, </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">listening to everything we say.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Farlen laughed to show what he thought of that notion. “My dogs would smell anything </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="471" height="15" font="1">in them bushes. Be all over them before you could break wind, boy.” </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Frogeaters don’t smell like men,” Frey insisted. “They have a boggy stink, like frogs </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and trees and scummy water. Moss grows under their arms in place of hair, and they can live </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="380" height="15" font="1">with nothing to eat but mud and breathe swamp water.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon was about to tell him what he ought to do with his wet nurse’s fable when Maester </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Luwin spoke up. “The histories say the crannogmen grew close to the children of the forest in </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the days when the greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck. It </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="287" height="15" font="1">may be that they have secret knowledge.” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Suddenly the wood seemed a deal darker than it had a moment before, as if a cloud had </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">passed before the sun. It was one thing to have some fool boy spouting folly, but maesters </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were supposed to be wise. “The only children that concern me are Bran and Rickon,” Theon </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="227" height="15" font="1">said. “Back to the stream. Now.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">For a moment he did not think they were going to obey, but in the end old habit asserted </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">itself. They followed sullenly, but they followed. The Frey boy was as jumpy as those rabbits </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he’d flushed earlier. Theon put men on either bank and followed the current. They rode for </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">miles, going slow and careful, dismounting to lead the horses over treacherous ground, letting </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the good-for-bear-bait hounds sniff at every bush. Where a fallen tree dammed the flow, the </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">hunters were forced to loop around a deep green pool, but if the direwolves had done the same </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they’d left neither print nor spoor. The beasts had taken to swimming, it seemed. <i>When I catch </i></text>

<text top="728" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">When the woods began to darken, Theon Greyjoy knew he was beaten. Either the </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crannogmen <i>did</i> know the magic of the children of the forest, or else Osha had deceived them </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with some wildling trick. He made them press on through the dusk, but when the last light </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">faded Joseth finally worked up the courage to say, “This is fruitless, my lord. We will lame a </text>

<text top="831" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Joseth has the right of it,” said Maester Luwin. “Groping through the woods by </text>

<text top="875" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon could taste bile at the back of his throat, and his stomach was a nest of snakes </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">twining and snapping at each other. If he crept back to Winterfell empty-handed, he might as </text>

<text top="959" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“M’lord prince.” Reek urged his horse near. “Might be them Starks never came this way. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You know that old mill, sitting lonely on the Acorn Water? We stopped there when I </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">that old knight clucked over her brats. Might be the Starks are hiding there.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon knew the mill. He had even tumbled the miller’s wife a time or two. There was </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nothing special about it, or her. “Why there? There are a dozen villages and holdfasts just as </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Amusement shone in those pale eyes. “Why? Now that’s past knowing. But they’re there, </text>

<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“M’lord prince?” Reek dismounted, and beckoned Theon to do the same. When they </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">were both afoot, he pulled open the cloth sack he’d fetched from Winterfell. “Have a look </text>

<text top="386" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was growing hard to see. Theon thrust his hand into the sack impatiently, groping </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">amongst soft fur and rough scratchy wool. A sharp point pricked his skin, and his fingers </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">closed around something cold and hard. He drew out a wolf’s-head brooch, silver and jet. </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Understanding came suddenly. His hand closed into a fist. “Gelmarr,” he said, wondering </text>

<text top="865" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If he knew they’d lit a fire, he’d flay the poor bastards,” said Ebben, a squat bald man </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="1">muscled like a bag of rocks. </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Fire is life up here,” said Qhorin Halfhand, “but it can be death as well.” By his </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">command, they’d risked no open flames since entering the mountains. They ate cold salt beef, </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">hard bread, and harder cheese, and slept clothed and huddled beneath a pile of cloaks and furs, </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grateful for each other’s warmth. It made Jon remember cold nights long ago at Winterfell, </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">when he’d shared a bed with his brothers. These men were brothers too, though the bed they </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">shared was stone and earth. </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="274" height="15" font="1">“They’ll have a horn,” said Stonesnake. </text>
<text top="1057" left="171" width="339" height="15" font="1">The Halfhand said, “A horn they must not blow.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That’s a long cruel climb by night,” Ebben said as he eyed the distant spark through a </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cleft in the rocks that sheltered them. The sky was cloudless, the jagged mountains rising </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">black on black until the very top, where their cold crowns of snow and ice shone palely in the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">moonlight. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And a longer fall,” said Qhorin Halfhand. “Two men, I think. There are like to be two </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">up there, sharing the watch.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Me.” The ranger they called Stonesnake had already shown that he was the best climber </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="263" height="15" font="1">among them. It would have to be him. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="184" height="15" font="1">“And me,” said Jon Snow. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Qhorin Halfhand looked at him. Jon could hear the wind keening as it shivered through </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the high pass above them. One of the garrons whickered and pawed at the thin stony soil of </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the hollow where they had taken shelter. “The wolf will remain with us,” Qhorin said. “White </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fur is seen too easily by moonlight.” He turned to Stonesnake. “When it’s done, throw down a </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="331" height="15" font="1">burning brand. We’ll come when we see it fall.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="356" height="15" font="1">“No better time to start than now,” said Stonesnake. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They each took a long coil of rope. Stonesnake carried a bag of iron spikes as well, and a </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">small hammer with its head wrapped in thick felt. Their garrons they left behind, along with </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their helms, mail, and Ghost. Jon knelt and let the direwolf nuzzle him before they set off. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="319" height="15" font="1">“Stay,” he commanded. “I’ll be back for you.” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake took the lead. He was a short wiry man, near fifty and grey of beard but </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stronger than he seemed, and he had the best night eyes of anyone Jon had ever known. He </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">needed them tonight. By day the mountains were blue-grey, brushed with frost, but once the </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sun vanished behind the jagged peaks they turned black. Now the rising moon had limned </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">them in white and silver. </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The black brothers moved through black shadows amidst black rocks, working their way </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up a steep, twisting trail as their breath frosted in the black air. Jon felt almost naked without </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his mail, but he did not miss its weight. This was hard going, and slow. To hurry here was to </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">risk a broken ankle or worse. Stonesnake seemed to know where to put his feet as if by </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="503" height="15" font="1">instinct, but Jon needed to be more careful on the broken, uneven ground. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The Skirling Pass was really a series of passes, a long twisting course that went up </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">around a succession of icy wind-carved peaks and down through hidden valleys that seldom </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">saw the sun. Apart from his companions, Jon had glimpsed no living man since they’d left the </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wood behind and begun to make their way upward. The Frostfangs were as cruel as any place </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the gods had made, and as inimical to men. The wind cut like a knife up here, and shrilled in </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the night like a mother mourning her slain children. What few trees they saw were stunted, </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grotesque things growing sideways out of cracks and fissures. Tumbled shelves of rock often </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">overhung the trail, fringed with hanging icicles that looked like long white teeth from a </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">distance. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yet even so, Jon Snow was not sorry he had come. There were wonders here as well. He </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had seen sunlight flashing on icy thin waterfalls as they plunged over the lips of sheer stone </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cliffs, and a mountain meadow full of autumn wildflowers, blue coldsnaps and bright scarlet </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">frostfires and stands of piper’s grass in russet and gold. He had peered down ravines so deep </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">and black they seemed certain to end in some hell, and he had ridden his garron over a wind-</text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eaten bridge of natural stone with nothing but sky to either side. Eagles nested in the heights </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and came down to hunt the valleys, circling effortlessly on great blue-grey wings that seemed </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">almost part of the sky. Once he had watched a shadowcat stalk a ram, flowing down the </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">mountainside like liquid smoke until it was ready to pounce. </text>
</page>
<page number="393" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>Now it is our turn to pounce.</i> He wished he could move as sure and silent as that </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shadowcat, and kill as quickly. Longclaw was sheathed across his back, but he might not have </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">room to use it. He carried dirk and dagger for closer work. <i>They will have weapons as well, </i></text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>and I am not armored.</i> He wondered who would prove the shadowcat by night’s end, and who </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">the ram. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">For a long way they stayed to the trail, following its twists and turns as it snaked along </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the side of the mountain, upward, ever upward. Sometimes the mountain folded back on itself </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and they lost sight of the fire, but soon or late it would always reappear. The path Stonesnake </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chose would never have served for the horses. In places Jon had to put his back to the cold </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stone and shuffle along sideways like a crab, inch by inch. Even where the track widened it </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was treacherous; there were cracks big enough to swallow a man’s leg, rubble to stumble </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">over, hollow places where the water pooled by day and froze hard by night. <i>One step and then </i></text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="5"><i>another</i>, Jon told himself. <i>One step and then another, and I will not fall.</i> </text>
<text top="368" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He had not shaved since leaving the Fist of the First Men, and the hair on his lip was </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">soon stiff with frost. Two hours into the climb, the wind kicked up so fiercely that it was all </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he could do to hunch down and cling to the rock, praying he would not be blown off the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mountain. <i>One step and then another</i>, he resumed when the gale subsided. <i>One step and then </i></text>
<text top="447" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="5"><i>another, and I will not fall.</i> </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Soon they were high enough so that looking down was best not considered. There was </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">nothing below but yawning blackness, nothing above but moon and stars. “The mountain is </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">your mother,” Stonesnake had told him during an easier climb a few days past. “Cling to her, </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">press your face up against her teats, and she won’t drop you.” Jon had made a joke of it, </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">saying how he’d always wondered who his mother was, but never thought to find her in the </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Frostfangs. It did not seem nearly so amusing now. <i>One step and then another</i>, he thought, </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="99" height="15" font="1">clinging tight. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The narrow track ended abruptly where a massive shoulder of black granite thrust out </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from the side of the mountain. After the bright moonlight, its shadow was so black that it felt </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like stepping into a cave. “Straight up here,” the ranger said in a quiet voice. “We want to get </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">above them.” He peeled off his gloves, tucked them through his belt, tied one end of his rope </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">around his waist, the other end around Jon. “Follow me when the rope grows taut.” The </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ranger did not wait for an answer but started at once, moving upward with fingers and feet, </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">faster than Jon would have believed. The long rope unwound slowly. Jon watched him </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">closely, making note of how he went, and where he found each handhold, and when the last </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="578" height="15" font="1">loop of hemp uncoiled, he took off his own gloves and followed, much more slowly. </text>
<text top="794" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake had passed the rope around the smooth spike of rock he was waiting on, but </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as soon as Jon reached him he shook it loose and was off again. This time there was no </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">convenient cleft when he reached the end of their tether, so he took out his felt-headed </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hammer and drove a spike deep into a crack in the stone with a series of gentle taps. Soft as </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the sounds were, they echoed off the stone so loudly that Jon winced with every blow, certain </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that the wildlings must hear them too. When the spike was secure, Stonesnake secured the </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">rope to it, and Jon started after him. <i>Suck on the mountain’s teat</i>, he reminded himself. <i>Don’t </i></text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>look down. Keep your weight above your feet. Don’t look down. Look at the rock in front of </i></text>
<text top="950" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>you. There’s a good handhold, yes. Don’t look down. I can catch a breath on that ledge there, </i></text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="5"><i>all I need to do is reach it. Never look down.</i> </text>
<text top="995" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Once his foot slipped as he put his weight on it and his heart stopped in his chest, but the </text>
<text top="1014" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gods were good and he did not fall. He could feel the cold seeping off the rock into his </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fingers, but he dared not don his gloves; gloves would slip, no matter how tight they seemed, </text>
<text top="1053" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cloth and fur moving between skin and stone, and up here that could kill him. His burned </text>
<text top="1073" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand was stiffening up on him, and soon it began to ache. Then he ripped open his thumbnail </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">somehow, and after that he left smears of blood wherever he put his hand. He hoped he still </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="290" height="15" font="1">had all his fingers by the end of the climb. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Up they went, and up, and up, black shadows creeping across the moonlit wall of rock. </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Anyone down on the floor of the pass could have seen them easily, but the mountain hid them </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from the view of the wildlings by their fire. They were close now, though. Jon could sense it. </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Even so, he did not think of the foes who were waiting for him, all unknowing, but of his </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">brother at Winterfell. <i>Bran used to love to climb. I wish I had a tenth part of his courage.</i> </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">The wall was broken two-thirds of the way up by a crooked fissure of icy stone. </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake reached down a hand to help him up. He had donned his gloves again, so Jon did </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the same. The ranger moved his head to the left, and the two of them crawled along the shelf </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">three hundred yards or more, until they could see the dull orange glow beyond the lip of the </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">cliff. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The wildlings had built their watchfire in a shallow depression above the narrowest part </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the pass, with a sheer drop below and rock behind to shelter them from the worst of the </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wind. That same windbreak allowed the black brothers to crawl within a few feet of them, </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="594" height="15" font="1">creeping along on their bellies until they were looking down on the men they must kill. </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">One was asleep, curled up tight and buried beneath a great mound of skins. Jon could see </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">nothing of him but his hair, bright red in the firelight. The second sat close to the flames, </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">feeding them twigs and branches and complaining of the wind in a querulous tone. The third </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">watched the pass, though there was little to see, only a vast bowl of darkness ringed by the </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="504" height="15" font="1">snowy shoulders of the mountains. It was the watcher who wore the horn. </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Three.</i> For a moment Jon was uncertain. <i>There was only supposed to be two.</i> One was </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">asleep, though. And whether there was two or three or twenty, he still must do what he had </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">come to do. Stonesnake touched his arm, pointed at the wildling with the horn. Jon nodded </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">toward the one by the fire. It felt queer, picking a man to kill. Half the days of his life had </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been spent with sword and shield, training for this moment. <i>Did Robb feel this way before his </i></text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>first battle?</i> he wondered, but there was no time to ponder the question. Stonesnake moved as </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fast as his namesake, leaping down on the wildlings in a rain of pebbles. Jon slid Longclaw </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="202" height="15" font="1">from its sheath and followed. </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It all seemed to happen in a heartbeat. Afterward Jon could admire the courage of the </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wildling who reached first for his horn instead of his blade. He got it to his lips, but before he </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could sound it Stonesnake knocked the horn aside with a swipe of his shortsword. Jon’s man </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">leapt to his feet, thrusting at his face with a burning brand. He could feel the heat of the </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">flames as he flinched back. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the sleeper stirring, and knew </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he must finish his man quick. When the brand swung again, he bulled into it, swinging the </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bastard sword with both hands. The Valyrian steel sheared through leather, fur, wool, and </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">flesh, but when the wildling fell he twisted, ripping the sword from Jon’s grasp. On the </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ground the sleeper sat up beneath his furs. Jon slid his dirk free, grabbing the man by the hair </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="586" height="15" font="1">and jamming the point of the knife up under his chin as he reached for his—no, <i>her</i>— </text>
<text top="903" left="171" width="172" height="15" font="1">His hand froze. “A girl.” </text>
<text top="928" left="171" width="384" height="15" font="1">“A watcher,” said Stonesnake. “A wildling. Finish her.” </text>
<text top="953" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon could see fear and fire in her eyes. Blood ran down her white throat from where the </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">point of his dirk had pricked her. <i>One thrust and it’s done</i>, he told himself. He was so close he </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could smell onion on her breath. <i>She is no older than I am.</i> Something about her made him </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">think of Arya, though they looked nothing at all alike. “Will you yield?” he asked, giving the </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">dirk a half turn. <i>And if she doesn’t?</i> </text>
<text top="1056" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">“I yield.” Her words steamed in the cold air. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="572" height="15" font="1">“You’re our captive, then.” He pulled the dirk away from the soft skin of her throat. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="401" height="15" font="1">“Qhorin said nothing of taking captives,” said Stonesnake. </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He never said not to.” Jon let go his grip on the girl’s hair, and she scuttled backward, </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">away from them. </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“She’s a spearwife.” Stonesnake gestured at the long-hafted axe that lay beside her </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sleeping furs. “She was reaching for that when you grabbed her. Give her half a chance and </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="233" height="15" font="1">she’ll bury it between your eyes.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I won’t give her half a chance.” Jon kicked the axe well out of the girl’s reach. “Do you </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">have a name?” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“Ygritte.” Her hand rubbed at her throat and came away bloody. She stared at the </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">wetness. </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sheathing his dirk, he wrenched Longclaw free from the body of the man he’d killed. </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">“You are my captive, Ygritte.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="162" height="15" font="1">“I gave you my name.” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="119" height="15" font="1">“I’m Jon Snow.” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="208" height="15" font="1">She flinched. “An evil name.” </text>
<text top="472" left="171" width="530" height="15" font="1">“A bastard name,” he said. “My father was Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The girl watched him warily, but Stonesnake gave a mordant chuckle. “It’s the captive </text>
<text top="517" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">supposed to tell things, remember?” The ranger thrust a long branch into the fire. “Not that </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she will. I’ve known wildlings to bite off their own tongues before they’d answer a question.” </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">When the end of the branch was blazing merrily, he took two steps and flung it out over the </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="430" height="15" font="1">pass. It fell through the night spinning until it was lost to sight. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="347" height="15" font="1">“You ought to burn them you killed,” said Ygritte. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Need a bigger fire for that, and big fires burn bright.” Stonesnake turned, his eyes </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scanning the black distance for any spark of light. “Are there more wildlings close by, is that </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="29" height="15" font="1">it?” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Burn them,” the girl repeated stubbornly, “or it might be you’ll need them swords </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">again.” </text>
<text top="734" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jon remembered dead Othor and his cold black hands. “Maybe we should do as she </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="45" height="15" font="1">says.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“There are other ways.” Stonesnake knelt beside the man he’d slain, stripped him of </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cloak and boots and belt and vest, then hoisted the body over one thin shoulder and carried it </text>
<text top="818" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to the edge. He grunted as he tossed it over. A moment later they heard a wet, heavy smack </text>
<text top="837" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">well below them. By then the ranger had the second body down to the skin and was dragging </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">it by the arms. Jon took the feet and together they flung the dead man out in the blackness of </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">the night. </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ygritte watched and said nothing. She was older than he’d thought at first, Jon realized; </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">maybe as old as twenty, but short for her age, bandy-legged, with a round face, small hands, </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and a pug nose. Her shaggy mop of red hair stuck out in all directions. She looked plump as </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she crouched there, but most of that was layers of fur and wool and leather. Underneath all </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">that she could be as skinny as Arya. </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">“Were you sent to watch for us?” Jon asked her. </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="131" height="15" font="1">“You, and others.” </text>
<text top="1054" left="171" width="515" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake warmed his hands over the fire. “What waits beyond the pass?” </text>

<text top="154" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Hundreds and thousands. More than you ever saw, crow.” She smiled. Her teeth were </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="169" height="15" font="1">crooked, but very white. </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="5"><i>She doesn’t know how many.</i> “Why come here?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="124" height="15" font="1">Ygritte fell silent. </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“What’s in the Frostfangs that your king could want? You can’t stay here, there’s no </text>

<text top="294" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">She turned her face away from him. </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“Do you mean to march on the Wall? When?” </text>
<text top="344" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">She stared at the flames as if she could not hear him. </text>
<text top="369" left="171" width="364" height="15" font="1">“Do you know anything of my uncle, Benjen Stark?” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ygritte ignored him. Stonesnake laughed. “If she spits out her tongue, don’t say I didn’t </text>
<text top="414" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">warn you.” </text>
<text top="439" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A low rumbling growl echoed off the rock. <i>Shadowcat</i>, Jon knew at once. As he rose he </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="491" height="15" font="1">heard another, closer at hand. He pulled his sword and turned, listening. </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“They won’t trouble us,” Ygritte said. “It’s the dead they’ve come for. Cats can smell </text>
<text top="503" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blood six miles off. They’ll stay near the bodies till they’ve eaten every last stringy shred o’ </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">meat, and cracked the bones for the marrow.” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon could hear the sounds of their feeding echoing off the rocks. It gave him an uneasy </text>
<text top="567" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">feeling. The warmth of the fire made him realize how bone-tired he was, but he dared not </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sleep. He had taken a captive, and it was on him to guard her. “Were they your kin?” he asked </text>
<text top="606" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">her quietly. “The two we killed?” </text>
<text top="631" left="171" width="171" height="15" font="1">“No more than you are.” </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">“Me?” He frowned. “What do you mean?” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="324" height="15" font="1">“You said you were the Bastard o’ Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="54" height="15" font="1">“I am.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="178" height="15" font="1">“Who was your mother?” </text>
<text top="757" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Some woman. Most of them are.” Someone had said that to him once. He did not </text>
<text top="776" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">remember who. </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She smiled again, a flash of white teeth. “And she never sung you the song o’ the winter </text>
<text top="821" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">rose?” </text>
<text top="846" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">“I never knew my mother. Or any such song.” </text>
<text top="871" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Bael the Bard made it,” said Ygritte. “He was King-beyond-the-Wall a long time back. </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">All the free folk know his songs, but might be you don’t sing them in the south.” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“Winterfell’s not in the south,” Jon objected. </text>
<text top="941" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">“Yes it is. Everything below the Wall’s south to us.” </text>
<text top="966" left="171" width="557" height="15" font="1">He had never thought of it that way. “I suppose it’s all in where you’re standing.” </text>
<text top="991" left="171" width="258" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” Ygritte agreed. “It always is.” </text>
<text top="1016" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Tell me,” Jon urged her. It would be hours before Qhorin came up, and a story would </text>
<text top="1035" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">help keep him awake. “I want to hear this tale of yours.” </text>
<text top="1061" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“Might be you won’t like it much.” </text>
</page>
<page number="397" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">“I’ll hear it all the same.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Brave black crow,” she mocked. “Well, long before he was king over the free folk, Bael </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">was a great raider.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="526" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake gave a snort. “A murderer, robber, and raper, is what you mean.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“That’s all in where you’re standing too,” Ygritte said. “The Stark in Winterfell wanted </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Bael’s head, but never could take him, and the taste o’ failure galled him. One day in his </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bitterness he called Bael a craven who preyed only on the weak. When word o’ that got back, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Bael vowed to teach the lord a lesson. So he scaled the Wall, skipped down the kingsroad, and </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">walked into Winterfell one winter’s night with harp in hand, naming himself Sygerrik of </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Skagos. <i>Sygerrik</i> means ‘deceiver’ in the Old Tongue, that the First Men spoke, and the giants </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">still speak.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“North or south, singers always find a ready welcome, so Bael ate at Lord Stark’s own </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">table, and played for the lord in his high seat until half the night was gone. The old songs he </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">played, and new ones he’d made himself, and he played and sang so well that when he was </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">done, the lord offered to let him name his own reward. ‘All I ask is a flower,’ Bael answered, </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="418" height="15" font="1">‘the fairest flower that blooms in the gardens o’ Winterfell.’” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Now as it happened the winter roses had only then come into bloom, and no flower is so </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">rare nor precious. So the Stark sent to his glass gardens and commanded that the most </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beautiful o’ the winter roses be plucked for the singer’s payment. And so it was done. But </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="651" height="15" font="1">when morning come, the singer had vanished . . . and so had Lord Brandon’s maiden </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">daughter. Her bed they found empty, but for the pale blue rose that Bael had left on the pillow </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">where her head had lain.” </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon had never heard this tale before. “Which Brandon was this supposed to be? Brandon </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Builder lived in the Age of Heroes, thousands of years before Bael. There was Brandon </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="394" height="15" font="1">the Burner and his father Brandon the Shipwright, but—” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This was Brandon the Daughterless,” Ygritte said sharply. “Would you hear the tale, or </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="36" height="15" font="1">no?” </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="153" height="15" font="1">He scowled. “Go on.” </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Lord Brandon had no other children. At his behest, the black crows flew forth from their </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">castles in the hundreds, but nowhere could they find any sign o’ Bael or this maid. For most a </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">year they searched, till the lord lost heart and took to his bed, and it seemed as though the line </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">o’ Starks was at its end. But one night as he lay waiting to die, Lord Brandon heard a child’s </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cry. He followed the sound and found his daughter back in her bedchamber, asleep with a </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">babe at her breast.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“Bael had brought her back?” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No. They had been in Winterfell all the time, hiding with the dead beneath the castle. </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The maid loved Bael so dearly she bore him a son, the song says . . . though if truth be told, </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">all the maids love Bael in them songs he wrote. Be that as it may, what’s certain is that Bael </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">left the child in payment for the rose he’d plucked unasked, and that the boy grew to be the </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">next Lord Stark. So there it is—you have Bael’s blood in you, same as me.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="208" height="15" font="1">“It never happened,” Jon said. </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She shrugged. “Might be it did, might be it didn’t. It is a good song, though. My mother </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">used to sing it to me. She was a woman too, Jon Snow. Like yours.” She rubbed her throat </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">where his dirk had cut her. “The song ends when they find the babe, but there is a darker end </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to the story. Thirty years later, when Bael was King-beyond-the-Wall and led the free folk </text>

<page number="398" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">south, it was young Lord Stark who met him at the Frozen Ford . . . and killed him, for Bael </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="421" height="15" font="1">would not harm his own son when they met sword to sword.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">“So the son slew the father instead,” said Jon. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Aye,” she said, “but the gods hate kinslayers, even when they kill unknowing. When </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lord Stark returned from the battle and his mother saw Bael’s head upon his spear, she threw </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">herself from a tower in her grief. Her son did not long outlive her. One o’ his lords peeled the </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">skin off him and wore him for a cloak.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="331" height="15" font="1">“Your Bael was a liar,” he told her, certain now. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“No,” Ygritte said, “but a bard’s truth is different than yours or mine. Anyway, you asked </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="622" height="15" font="1">for the story, so I told it.” She turned away from him, closed her eyes, and seemed to sleep. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dawn and Qhorin Halfhand arrived together. The black stones had turned to grey and the </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">eastern sky had gone indigo when Stonesnake spied the rangers below, wending their way </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">upward. Jon woke his captive and held her by the arm as they descended to meet them. </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Thankfully, there was another way off the mountain to the north and west, along paths much </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gentler than the one that had brought them up here. They were waiting in a narrow defile </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">when their brothers appeared, leading their garrons. Ghost raced ahead at first scent of them. </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jon squatted to let the direwolf close his jaws around his wrist, tugging his hand back and </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">forth. It was a game they played. But when he glanced up, he saw Ygritte watching with eyes </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="225" height="15" font="1">as wide and white as hen’s eggs. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Qhorin Halfhand made no comment when he saw the prisoner. “There were three,” </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake told him. No more than that. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“We passed two,” Ebben said, “or what the cats had left of them.” He eyed the girl </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="239" height="15" font="1">sourly, suspicion plain on his face. </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="281" height="15" font="1">“She yielded,” Jon felt compelled to say. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">Qhorin’s face was impassive. “Do you know who I am?” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="586" height="15" font="1">“Qhorin Halfhand.” The girl looked half a child beside him, but she faced him boldly. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Tell me true. If I fell into the hands of your people and yielded myself, what would it </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">win me?” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="221" height="15" font="1">“A slower death than elsewise.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The big ranger looked to Jon. “We have no food to feed her, nor can we spare a man to </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="82" height="15" font="1">watch her.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The way before us is perilous enough, lad,” said Squire Dalbridge. “One shout when we </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="319" height="15" font="1">need silence, and every man of us is doomed.” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="396" height="15" font="1">Ebben drew his dagger. “A steel kiss will keep her quiet.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="570" height="15" font="1">Jon’s throat was raw. He looked at them all helplessly. “She yielded herself to me.” </text>
<text top="882" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Then you must do what needs be done,” Qhorin Halfhand said. “You are the blood of </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Winterfell and a man of the Night’s Watch.” He looked at the others. “Come, brothers. Leave </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him to it. It will go easier for him if we do not watch.” And he led them up the steep twisting </text>
<text top="940" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trail toward the pale pink glow of the sun where it broke through a mountain cleft, and before </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">very long only Jon and Ghost remained with the wildling girl. </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He thought Ygritte might try to run, but she only stood there, waiting, looking at him. </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“You never killed a woman before, did you?” When he shook his head, she said, “We die the </text>
<text top="1024" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same as men. But you don’t need to do it. Mance would take you, I know he would. There’s </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="335" height="15" font="1">secret ways. Them crows would never catch us.” </text>
<text top="1068" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">“I’m as much a crow as they are,” Jon said. </text>

<page number="399" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="340" height="15" font="1">She nodded, resigned. “Will you burn me, after?” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="249" height="15" font="1">“I can’t. The smoke might be seen.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“That’s so.” She shrugged. “Well, there’s worse places to end up than the belly of a </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">shadowcat.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="400" height="15" font="1">He pulled Longclaw over a shoulder. “Aren’t you afraid?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Last night I was,” she admitted. “But now the sun’s up.” She pushed her hair aside to </text>
<text top="243" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bare her neck, and knelt before him. “Strike hard and true, crow, or I’ll come back and haunt </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">you.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Longclaw was not so long or heavy a sword as his father’s Ice, but it was Valyrian steel </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all the same. He touched the edge of the blade to mark where the blow must fall, and Ygritte </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="416" height="15" font="1">shivered. “That’s cold,” she said. “Go on, be quick about it.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He raised Longclaw over his head, both hands tight around the grip. <i>One cut, with all my </i></text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>weight behind it.</i> He could give her a quick clean death, at least. He was his father’s son. </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">Wasn’t he? Wasn’t he? </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Do it,” she urged him after a moment. “Bastard. <i>Do it.</i> I can’t stay brave forever.” When </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">the blow did not fall she turned her head to look at him. </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="294" height="15" font="1">Jon lowered his sword. “Go,” he muttered. </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="101" height="15" font="1">Ygritte stared. </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="309" height="15" font="1">“<i>Now</i>,” he said, “before my wits return. <i>Go.</i>” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="71" height="15" font="1">She went. </text>

<text top="637" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The southern sky was black with smoke. It rose swirling off a hundred distant fires, its </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sooty fingers smudging out the stars. Across the Blackwater Rush, a line of flame burned </text>
<text top="676" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">nightly from horizon to horizon, while on this side the Imp had fired the whole riverfront: </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">docks and warehouses, homes and brothels, everything outside the city walls. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Even in the Red Keep, the air tasted of ashes. When Sansa found Ser Dontos in the quiet </text>
<text top="740" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the godswood, he asked if she’d been crying. “It’s only from the smoke,” she lied. “It looks </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="288" height="15" font="1">as though half the kingswood is burning.” </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Lord Stannis wants to smoke out the Imp’s savages.” Dontos swayed as he spoke, one </text>
<text top="804" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree. A wine stain discolored the red-and-yellow motley of his </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">tunic. “They kill his scouts and raid his baggage train. And the wildlings have been lighting </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fires too. The Imp told the queen that Stannis had better train his horses to eat ash, since he </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would find no blade of grass. I heard him say so. I hear all sorts of things as a fool that I never </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">heard when I was a knight. They talk as though I am not there, and”—he leaned close, </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">breathing his winey breath right in her face—“the Spider pays in gold for any little trifle. I </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">think Moon Boy has been his for years.” </text>

<text top="965" left="139" width="431" height="15" font="1">“Is it true Lord Stannis burned the godswood at Storm’s End?” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dontos nodded. “He made a great pyre of the trees as an offering to his new god. The red </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">priestess made him do it. They say she rules him now, body and soul. He’s vowed to burn the </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Let him.” When Sansa had first beheld the Great Sept with its marble walls and seven </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crystal towers, she’d thought it was the most beautiful building in the world, but that had been </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">before Joffrey beheaded her father on its steps. “I want it burned.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="261" height="15" font="1">“Hush, child, the gods will hear you.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="341" height="15" font="1">“Why should they? They never hear my prayers.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="337" height="15" font="1">“Yes they do. They sent me to you, didn’t they?” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa picked at the bark of a tree. She felt light-headed, almost feverish. “They sent you, </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">but what good have you done? You promised you would take me home, but I’m still here.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Dontos patted her arm. “I’ve spoken to a certain man I know, a good friend to me . . . and </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">you, my lady. He will hire a swift ship to take us to safety, when the time is right.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The time is right now,” Sansa insisted, “before the fighting starts. They’ve forgotten </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="343" height="15" font="1">about me. I know we could slip away if we tried.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Child, child.” Dontos shook his head. “Out of the castle, yes, we could do that, but the </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">city gates are more heavily guarded than ever, and the Imp has even closed off the river.” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was true. The Blackwater Rush was as empty as Sansa had ever seen it. All the ferries </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had been withdrawn to the north bank, and the trading galleys had fled or been seized by the </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Imp to be made over for battle. The only ships to be seen were the king’s war galleys. They </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">rowed endlessly up and down, staying to the deep water in the middle of the river and </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">exchanging flights of arrows with Stannis’s archers on the south shore. </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lord Stannis himself was still on the march, but his vanguard had appeared two nights </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ago during the black of the moon. King’s Landing had woken to the sight of their tents and </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">banners. They were five thousand, Sansa had heard, near as many as all the gold cloaks in the </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">city. They flew the red or green apples of House Fossoway, the turtle of Estermont, and the </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">fox-and-flowers of Florent, and their commander was Ser Guyard Morrigen, a famous </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">southron knight who men now called Guyard the Green. His standard showed a crow in flight, </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">its black wings spread wide against a storm-green sky. But it was the pale yellow banners that </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">worried the city. Long ragged tails streamed behind them like flickering flames, and in place </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">of a lord’s sigil they bore the device of a god: the burning heart of the Lord of Light. </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“When Stannis comes, he’ll have ten times as many men as Joffrey does, everyone says </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="31" height="15" font="1">so.” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dontos squeezed her shoulder. “The size of his host does not matter, sweetling, so long </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">as they are on the wrong side of the river. Stannis cannot cross without ships.” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="241" height="15" font="1">“He <i>has</i> ships. More than Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It’s a long sail from Storm’s End, the fleet will need to come up Massey’s Hook and </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through the Gullet and across Blackwater Bay. Perhaps the good gods will send a storm to </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sweep them from the seas.” Dontos gave a hopeful smile. “It is not easy for you, I know. You </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">must be patient, child. When my friend returns to the city, we shall have our ship. Have faith </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="1">in your Florian, and try not to be afraid.” </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sansa dug her nails into her hand. She could feel the fear in her tummy, twisting and </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pinching, worse every day. Nightmares of the day Princess Myrcella had sailed still troubled </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">her sleep; dark suffocating dreams that woke her in the black of night, struggling for breath. </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She could hear the people screaming at her, screaming without words, like animals. They had </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hemmed her in and thrown filth at her and tried to pull her off her horse, and would have done </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">worse if the Hound had not cut his way to her side. They had torn the High Septon to pieces </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="506" height="15" font="1">and smashed in Ser Aron’s head with a rock. <i>Try not to be afraid!</i> he said. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The whole city was afraid. Sansa could see it from the castle walls. The smallfolk were </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hiding themselves behind closed shutters and barred doors as if that would keep them safe. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The last time King’s Landing had fallen, the Lannisters looted and raped as they pleased and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">put hundreds to the sword, even though the city had opened its gates. This time the Imp meant </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">to fight, and a city that fought could expect no mercy at all. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dontos was prattling on. “If I were still a knight, I should have to put on armor and man </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="559" height="15" font="1">the walls with the rest. I ought to kiss King Joffrey’s feet and thank him sweetly.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If you thanked him for making you a fool, he’d make you a knight again,” Sansa said </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">sharply. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="1">Dontos chuckled. “My Jonquil’s a clever girl, isn’t she?” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">“Joffrey and his mother say I’m stupid.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let them. You’re safer that way, sweetling. Queen Cersei and the Imp and Lord Varys </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and their like, they all watch each other keen as hawks, and pay this one and that one to spy </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">out what the others are doing, but no one ever troubles themselves about Lady Tanda’s </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">daughter, do they?” Dontos covered his mouth to stifle a burp. “Gods preserve you, my little </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jonquil.” He was growing weepy. The wine did that to him. “Give your Florian a little kiss </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="314" height="15" font="1">now. A kiss for luck.” He swayed toward her. </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa dodged the wet groping lips, kissed him lightly on an unshaven cheek, and bid him </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">good night. It took all her strength not to weep. She had been weeping too much of late. It was </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">unseemly, she knew, but she could not seem to help herself; the tears would come, sometimes </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="380" height="15" font="1">over a trifle, and nothing she did could hold them back. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The drawbridge to Maegor’s Holdfast was unguarded. The Imp had moved most of the </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">gold cloaks to the city walls, and the white knights of the Kingsguard had duties more </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">important than dogging her heels. Sansa could go where she would so long as she did not try </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">to leave the castle, but there was nowhere she wanted to go. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She crossed over the dry moat with its cruel iron spikes and made her way up the narrow </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">turnpike stair, but when she reached the door of her bedchamber she could not bear to enter. </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The very walls of the room made her feel trapped; even with the window opened wide it felt </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">as though there were no air to breathe. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Turning back to the stair, Sansa climbed. The smoke blotted out the stars and the thin </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crescent of moon, so the roof was dark and thick with shadows. Yet from here she could see </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">everything: the Red Keep’s tall towers and great corner-forts, the maze of city streets beyond, </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to south and west the river running black, the bay to the east, the columns of smoke and </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">cinders, and fires, fires everywhere. Soldiers crawled over the city walls like ants with </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">torches, and crowded the hoardings that had sprouted from the ramparts. Down by the Mud </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gate, outlined against the drifting smoke, she could make out the vague shape of the three </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">huge catapults, the biggest anyone had ever seen, overtopping the walls by a good twenty feet. </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Yet none of it made her feel less fearful. A stab went through her, so sharp that Sansa sobbed </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and clutched at her belly. She might have fallen, but a shadow moved suddenly, and strong </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="285" height="15" font="1">fingers grabbed her arm and steadied her. </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She grabbed a merlon for support, her fingers scrabbling at the rough stone. “Let go of </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="173" height="15" font="1">me,” she cried. “Let go.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The little bird thinks she has wings, does she? Or do you mean to end up crippled like </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="158" height="15" font="1">that brother of yours?” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa twisted in his grasp. “I wasn’t going to fall. It was only . . . you startled me, that’s </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“You mean I scared you. And still do.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="600" height="15" font="1">She took a deep breath to calm herself. “I thought I was alone, I . . .” She glanced away. </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The little bird still can’t bear to look at me, can she?” The Hound released her. “You </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="538" height="15" font="1">were glad enough to see my face when the mob had you, though. Remember?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Sansa remembered all too well. She remembered the way they had howled, the feel of the </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood running down her cheek from where the stone had struck her, and the garlic stink on the </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">breath of the man who had tried to pull her from her horse. She could still feel the cruel pinch </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">of fingers on her wrist as she lost her balance and began to fall. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She’d thought she was going to die then, but the fingers had twitched, all five at once, </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and the man had shrieked loud as a horse. When his hand fell away, another hand, stronger, </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shoved her back into her saddle. The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground, blood </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pumping out the stump of his arm, but there were others all around, some with clubs in hand. </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The Hound leapt at them, his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung. When </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">they broke and ran before him he had laughed, his terrible burned face for a moment </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="90" height="15" font="1">transformed. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She made herself look at that face now, really look. It was only courteous, and a lady </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">must never forget her courtesies. <i>The scars are not the worst part, nor even the way his mouth </i></text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>twitches. It’s his eyes.</i> She had never seen eyes so full of anger. “I . . . I should have come to </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="622" height="15" font="1">you after,” she said haltingly. “To thank you, for . . . for saving me . . . you were so brave.” </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Brave?” His laugh was half a snarl. “A dog doesn’t need courage to chase off rats. They </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="412" height="15" font="1">had me thirty to one, and not a man of them dared face me.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She hated the way he talked, always so harsh and angry. “Does it give you joy to scare </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">people?” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No, it gives me joy to kill people.” His mouth twitched. “Wrinkle up your face all you </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">like, but spare me this false piety. You were a high lord’s get. Don’t tell me Lord Eddard </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="274" height="15" font="1">Stark of Winterfell never killed a man.” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="265" height="15" font="1">“That was his duty. He never liked it.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Is that what he told you?” Clegane laughed again. “Your father lied. Killing is the </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sweetest thing there is.” He drew his longsword. “<i>Here’s</i> your truth. Your precious father </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">found that out on Baelor’s steps. Lord of Winterfell, Hand of the King, Warden of the North, </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the mighty Eddard Stark, of a line eight thousand years old . . . but Ilyn Payne’s blade went </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through his neck all the same, didn’t it? Do you remember the dance he did when his head </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">came off his shoulders?” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Sansa hugged herself, suddenly cold. “Why are you always so hateful? I was <i>thanking</i> </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="1">you . . .” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Just as if I was one of those true knights you love so well, yes. What do you think a </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knight is <i>for</i>, girl? You think it’s all taking favors from ladies and looking fine in gold plate? </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Knights are for <i>killing</i>.” He laid the edge of his longsword against her neck, just under her ear. </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sansa could feel the sharpness of the steel. “I killed my first man at twelve. I’ve lost count of </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">how many I’ve killed since then. High lords with old names, fat rich men dressed in velvet, </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knights puffed up like bladders with their honors, yes, and women and children too—they’re </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all meat, and I’m the butcher. Let them have their lands and their gods and their gold. Let </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them have their <i>sers</i>.” Sandor Clegane spat at her feet to show what he thought of that. “So </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">long as I have this,” he said, lifting the sword from her throat, “there’s no man on earth I need </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Except your brother</i>, Sansa thought, but she had better sense than to say it aloud. <i>He is a </i></text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Clegane’s eyes turned toward the distant fires. “All this burning.” He sheathed his sword. </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="201" height="15" font="1">“Lord Stannis is no coward.” </text>

<text top="327" left="171" width="181" height="15" font="1">“Fight. Kill. Die, maybe.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aren’t you afraid? The gods might send you down to some terrible hell for all the evil </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">you’ve done.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“What evil?” He laughed. “What gods?” </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="201" height="15" font="1">“The gods who made us all.” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“All?” he mocked. “Tell me, little bird, what kind of god makes a monster like the Imp, </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">or a halfwit like Lady Tanda’s daughter? If there are gods, they made sheep so wolves could </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">eat mutton, and they made the weak for the strong to play with.” </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="226" height="15" font="1">“True knights protect the weak.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He snorted. “There are no true knights, no more than there are gods. If you can’t protect </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yourself, die and get out of the way of those who can. Sharp steel and strong arms rule this </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">world, don’t ever believe any different.” </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">Sansa backed away from him. “You’re awful.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“I’m honest. It’s the world that’s awful. Now fly away, little bird, I’m sick of you </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">peeping at me.” </text>
<text top="670" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Wordless, she fled. She was afraid of Sandor Clegane . . . and yet, some part of her </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wished that Ser Dontos had a little of the Hound’s ferocity. <i>There are gods</i>, she told herself, </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="5"><i>and there are true knights too. All the stories can’t be lies.</i> </text>
<text top="734" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">That night Sansa dreamed of the riot again. The mob surged around her, shrieking, a </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">maddened beast with a thousand faces. Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into </text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them she had never done them hurt, yet they </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dragged her from her horse all the same. “No,” she cried, “no, please, don’t, <i>don’t</i>,” but no </text>
<text top="812" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one paid her any heed. She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">came. She called for the heroes from the songs, for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard. Women swarmed over her like weasels, </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and she felt her </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">teeth shatter. Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel. The knife plunged into her belly and </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">tore and tore and tore, until there was nothing left of her down there but shiny wet ribbons. </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she woke, the pale light of morning was slanting through her window, yet she felt </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as sick and achy as if she had not slept at all. There was something sticky on her thighs. When </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she threw back the blanket and saw the blood, all she could think was that her dream had </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">somehow come true. She remembered the knives inside her, twisting and ripping. She </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">squirmed away in horror, kicking at the sheets and falling to the floor, breathing raggedly, </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">naked, bloodied, and afraid. </text>
</page>
<page number="404" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But as she crouched there, on her hands and knees, understanding came. “No, please,” </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sansa whimpered, “please, no.” She didn’t want this happening to her, not now, not here, not </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">now, not now, not now, not now. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Madness took hold of her. Pulling herself up by the bedpost, she went to the basin and </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">washed between her legs, scrubbing away all the stickiness. By the time she was done, the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">water was pink with blood. When her maidservants saw it they would <i>know</i>. Then she </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">remembered the bedclothes. She rushed back to the bed and stared in horror at the dark red </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">stain and the tale it told. All she could think was that she had to get rid of it, or else they’d see. </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">She couldn’t let them see, or they’d marry her to Joffrey and make her lay with him. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Snatching up her knife, Sansa hacked at the sheet, cutting out the stain. <i>If they ask me </i></text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>about the hole, what will I say?</i> Tears ran down her face. She pulled the torn sheet from the </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bed, and the stained blanket as well. <i>I’ll have to burn them.</i> She balled up the evidence, </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stuffed it in the fireplace, drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. Then she </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">realized that the blood had soaked through the sheet into the featherbed, so she bundled that </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up as well, but it was big and cumbersome, hard to move. Sansa could get only half of it into </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the fire. She was on her knees, struggling to shove the mattress into the flames as thick grey </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smoke eddied around her and filled the room, when the door burst open and she heard her </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">maid gasp. </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">In the end it took three of them to pull her away. And it was all for nothing. The </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bedclothes were burnt, but by the time they carried her off her thighs were bloody again. It </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was as if her own body had betrayed her to Joffrey, unfurling a banner of Lannister crimson </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="161" height="15" font="1">for all the world to see. </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the fire was out, they carried off the singed featherbed, fanned away the worst of </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the smoke, and brought up a tub. Women came and went, muttering and looking at her </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">strangely. They filled the tub with scalding-hot water, bathed her and washed her hair and </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gave her a cloth to wear between her legs. By then Sansa was calm again, and ashamed for </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">her folly. The smoke had ruined most of her clothing. One of the women went away and came </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back with a green wool shift that was almost her size. “It’s not as pretty as your own things, </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but it will serve,” she announced when she’d pulled it down over Sansa’s head. “Your shoes </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">weren’t burned, so at least you won’t need to go barefoot to the queen.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei Lannister was breaking her fast when Sansa was ushered into her solar. “You may </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">sit,” the queen said graciously. “Are you hungry?” She gestured at the table. There was </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="377" height="15" font="1">porridge, honey, milk, boiled eggs, and crisp fried fish. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The sight of the food made Sansa feel ill. Her tummy was tied in a knot. “No, thank you, </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I don’t blame you. Between Tyrion and Lord Stannis, everything I eat tastes of ash. And </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">now you’re setting fires as well. What did you hope to accomplish?” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">Sansa lowered her head. “The blood frightened me.” </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The blood is the seal of your womanhood. Lady Catelyn might have prepared you. </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">You’ve had your first flowering, no more.” </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sansa had never felt less flowery. “My lady mother told me, but I . . . I thought it would </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">be different.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="122" height="15" font="1">“Different how?” </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="382" height="15" font="1">“I don’t know. Less . . . less messy, and more magical.” </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Queen Cersei laughed. “Wait until you birth a child, Sansa. A woman’s life is nine parts </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mess to one part magic, you’ll learn that soon enough . . . and the parts that look like magic </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">often turn out to be messiest of all.” She took a sip of milk. “So now you are a woman. Do </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">you have the least idea of what that means?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It means that I am now fit to be wedded and bedded,” said Sansa, “and to bear children </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">for the king.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The queen gave a wry smile. “A prospect that no longer entices you as it once did, I can </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">see. I will not fault you for that. Joffrey has always been difficult. Even his birth . . . I labored </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a day and a half to bring him forth. You cannot imagine the pain, Sansa. I screamed so loudly </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="379" height="15" font="1">that I fancied Robert might hear me in the kingswood.” </text>

<text top="628" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A half-smile flickered across the queen’s face. “Robert’s trueborn son and heir. Though </text>

<text top="954" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Icy fingers of water trickled down from the snowpack above into small frozen pools that </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cracked and broke beneath the hooves of their garrons. Sometimes they would see a few </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weeds struggling from some crack in the rock or a splotch of pale lichen, but there was no </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="1">grass, and they were above the trees now. </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The track was as steep as it was narrow, wending its way ever upward. Where the pass </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">scanning the heights as he went, his longbow ever close to hand. It was said he had the </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ghost padded restlessly by Jon’s side. From time to time he would stop and turn, his ears </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pricked, as if he heard something behind them. Jon did not think the shadowcats would attack </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">living men, not unless they were starving, but he loosened Longclaw in its scabbard even so. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A wind-carved arch of grey stone marked the highest point of the pass. Here the way </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">broadened as it began its long descent toward the valley of the Milkwater. Qhorin decreed that </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon saw the sense of that. It would be pleasant to ride in the light for a time, to let the </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">bright mountain sun soak through their cloaks and chase the chill from their bones, but they </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">dared not. Where there were three watchers there might be others, waiting to sound the alarm. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Stonesnake curled up under his ragged fur cloak and was asleep almost at once. Jon </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shared his salt beef with Ghost while Ebben and Squire Dalbridge fed the horses. Qhorin </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Halfhand sat with his back to a rock, honing the edge of his longsword with long slow strokes. </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Jon watched the ranger for a few moments, then summoned his courage and went to him. “My </text>

<text top="463" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“I am no lord, Jon Snow.” Qhorin slid the stone smoothly along the steel with his two-</text>

<text top="508" left="171" width="373" height="15" font="1">“She told me Mance would take me, if I ran with her.” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="140" height="15" font="1">“She told you true.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="390" height="15" font="1">“She even claimed we were kin. She told me a story . . .” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“. . . of Bael the Bard and the rose of Winterfell. So Stonesnake told me. It happens I </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">know the song. Mance would sing it of old, when he came back from a ranging. He had a </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="431" height="15" font="1">passion for wildling music. Aye, and for their women as well.” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="127" height="15" font="1">“You knew him?” </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="270" height="15" font="1">“We all knew him.” His voice was sad. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>They were friends as well as brothers</i>, Jon realized, <i>and now they are sworn foes.</i> “Why </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="106" height="15" font="1">did he desert?” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“For a wench, some say. For a crown, others would have it.” Qhorin tested the edge of </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his sword with the ball of his thumb. “He liked women, Mance did, and he was not a man </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">whose knees bent easily, that’s true. But it was more than that. He loved the wild better than </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Wall. It was in his blood. He was wildling born, taken as a child when some raiders were </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">put to the sword. When he left the Shadow Tower he was only going home again.” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="175" height="15" font="1">“Was he a good ranger?” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“He was the best of us,” said the Halfhand, “and the worst as well. Only fools like </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Thoren Smallwood despise the wildlings. They are as brave as we are, Jon. As strong, as </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">quick, as clever. But they have no discipline. They name themselves the free folk, and each </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one thinks himself as good as a king and wiser than a maester. Mance was the same. He never </text>

<text top="973" left="171" width="256" height="15" font="1">“No more than me,” said Jon quietly. </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Qhorin’s shrewd grey eyes seemed to see right through him. “So you let her go?” He did </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">not sound the least surprised. </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="98" height="15" font="1">“You know?” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was hard to put into words. “My father never used a headsman. He said he owed it to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the men he killed to look into their eyes and hear their last words. And when I looked into </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ygritte’s eyes, I . . .” Jon stared down at his hands helplessly. “I know she was an enemy, but </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">there was no evil in her.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="228" height="15" font="1">“No more than in the other two.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“It was their lives or ours,” Jon said. “If they had seen us, if they had sounded that </text>

<text top="257" left="171" width="428" height="15" font="1">“The wildlings would hunt us down and slay us, true enough.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Stonesnake has the horn now, though, and we took Ygritte’s knife and axe. She’s </text>

<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And not like to be a threat,” Qhorin agreed. “If I had needed her dead, I would have left </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="294" height="15" font="1">her with Ebben, or done the thing myself.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="278" height="15" font="1">“Then why did you command it of me?” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I did not command it. I told you to do what needed to be done, and left you to decide </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">what that would be.” Qhorin stood and slid his longsword back into its scabbard. “When I </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">want a mountain scaled, I call on Stonesnake. Should I need to put an arrow through the eye </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of some foe across a windy battlefield, I summon Squire Dalbridge. Ebben can make any man </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">give up his secrets. To lead men you must know them, Jon Snow. I know more of you now </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">than I did this morning.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="246" height="15" font="1">“And if I had slain her?” asked Jon. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“She would be dead, and I would know you better than I had before. But enough talk. </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">You ought be sleeping. We have leagues to go, and dangers to face. You will need your </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="71" height="15" font="1">strength.” </text>
<text top="608" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon did not think sleep would come easily, but he knew the Halfhand was right. He found </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a place out of the wind, beneath an overhang of rock, and took off his cloak to use it for a </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blanket. “Ghost,” he called. “Here. To me.” He always slept better with the great white wolf </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beside him; there was comfort in the smell of him, and welcome warmth in that shaggy pale </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fur. This time, though, Ghost did no more than look at him. Then he turned away and padded </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">around the garrons, and quick as that he was gone. <i>He wants to hunt</i>, Jon thought. Perhaps </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">there were goats in these mountains. The shadowcats must live on something. “Just don’t try </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and bring down a ‘cat,” he muttered. Even for a direwolf, that would be dangerous. He tugged </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="370" height="15" font="1">his cloak over him and stretched out beneath the rock. </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">When he closed his eyes, he dreamed of direwolves. </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There were five of them when there should have been six, and they were scattered, each </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">apart from the others. He felt a deep ache of emptiness, a sense of incompleteness. The forest </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was vast and cold, and they were so small, so lost. His brothers were out there somewhere, </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and his sister, but he had lost their scent. He sat on his haunches and lifted his head to the </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">darkening sky, and his cry echoed through the forest, a long lonely mournful sound. As it died </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">away, he pricked up his ears, listening for an answer, but the only sound was the sigh of </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">blowing snow. </text>
<text top="957" left="171" width="37" height="15" font="5"><i>Jon?</i> </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The call came from behind him, softer than a whisper, but strong too. Can a shout be </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">silent? He turned his head, searching for his brother, for a glimpse of a lean grey shape </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="393" height="15" font="1">moving beneath the trees, but there was nothing, only . . . </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="93" height="15" font="1">A weirwood. </text>

<page number="408" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It seemed to sprout from solid rock, its pale roots twisting up from a myriad of fissures </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and hairline cracks. The tree was slender compared to other weirwoods he had seen, no more </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than a sapling, yet it was growing as he watched, its limbs thickening as they reached for the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sky. Wary, he circled the smooth white trunk until he came to the face. Red eyes looked at </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him. Fierce eyes they were, yet glad to see him. The weirwood had his brother’s face. Had his </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">brother always had three eyes? </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="5"><i>Not always</i>, came the silent shout. <i>Not before the crow.</i> </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He sniffed at the bark, smelled wolf and tree and boy, but behind that there were other </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">scents, the rich brown smell of warm earth and the hard grey smell of stone and something </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">else, something terrible. Death, he knew. He was smelling death. He cringed back, his hair </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="1">bristling, and bared his fangs. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Don’t be afraid, I like it in the dark. No one can see you, but you can see them. But first </i></text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="5"><i>you have to open your eyes. See? Like this.</i> And the tree reached down and touched him. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And suddenly he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a drift of snow as he </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stood upon the edge of a great precipice. Before him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">emptiness, and a long vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all the </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="213" height="15" font="1">colors of an autumn afternoon. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between the mountains as </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he thought he had dreamed himself back to </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Castle Black. Then he realized he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">Under that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters reflecting the </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">snowcapped peaks that ringed it. There were men down in the valley, he saw now; many men, </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thousands, a huge host. Some were tearing great holes in the half-frozen ground, while others </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trained for war. He watched as a swarming mass of riders charged a shield wall, astride horses </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">no larger than ants. The sound of their mock battle was a rustling of steel leaves, drifting </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">faintly on the wind. Their encampment had no plan to it; he saw no ditches, no sharpened </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stakes, no neat rows of horse lines. Everywhere crude earthen shelters and hide tents sprouted </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">haphazardly, like a pox on the face of the earth. He spied untidy mounds of hay, smelled goats </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and sheep, horses and pigs, dogs in great profusion. Tendrils of dark smoke rose from a </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="137" height="15" font="1">thousand cookfires. </text>
<text top="722" left="171" width="552" height="15" font="5"><i>This is no army, no more than it is a town. This is a whole people come together.</i> </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Across the long lake, one of the mounds moved. He watched it more closely and saw that </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">it was not dirt at all, but alive, a shaggy lumbering beast with a snake for a nose and tusks </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">larger than those of the greatest boar that had ever lived. And the thing riding it was huge as </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="495" height="15" font="1">well, and his shape was wrong, too thick in the leg and hips to be a man. </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Then a sudden gust of cold made his fur stand up, and the air thrilled to the sound of </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wings. As he lifted his eyes to the ice-white mountain heights above, a shadow plummeted out </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of the sky. A shrill scream split the air. He glimpsed blue-grey pinions spread wide, shutting </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">out the sun . . . </text>
<text top="914" left="171" width="601" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ghost!</i>” Jon shouted, sitting up. He could still feel the talons, the <i>pain</i>. “Ghost, to me!” </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ebben appeared, grabbed him, shook him. “Quiet! You mean to bring the wildlings down </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">on us? What’s wrong with you, boy?” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A dream,” said Jon feebly. “I was Ghost, I was on the edge of the mountain looking </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">down on a frozen river, and something attacked me. A bird . . . an eagle, I think . . .” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Squire Dalbridge smiled. “It’s always pretty women in my dreams. Would that I dreamed </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="90" height="15" font="1">more often.” </text>
</page>
<page number="409" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">Qhorin came up beside him. “A frozen river, you say?” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="568" height="15" font="1">“The Milkwater flows from a great lake at the foot of a glacier,” Stonesnake put in. </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There was a tree with my brother’s face. The wildlings . . . there were <i>thousands</i>, more </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than I ever knew existed. And giants riding mammoths.” From the way the light had shifted, </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jon judged that he had been asleep for four or five hours. His head ached, and the back of his </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="506" height="15" font="1">neck where the talons had burned through him. <i>But that was in the dream.</i> </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="502" height="15" font="1">“Tell me all that you remember, from first to last,” said Qhorin Halfhand. </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="285" height="15" font="1">Jon was confused. “It was only a dream.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A wolf dream,” the Halfhand said. “Craster told the Lord Commander that the wildlings </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were gathering at the source of the Milkwater. That may be why you dreamed it. Or it may be </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that you saw what waits for us, a few hours farther on. Tell me.” It made him feel half a fool </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to talk of such things to Qhorin and the other rangers, but he did as he was commanded. None </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">of the black brothers laughed at him, however. By the time he was done, even Squire </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">Dalbridge was no longer smiling. </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Skinchanger?” said Ebben grimly, looking at the Halfhand. <i>Does he mean the eagle?</i> </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Jon wondered. <i>Or me?</i> Skinchangers and wargs belonged in Old Nan’s stories, not in the </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">world he had lived in all his life. Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">was not hard to believe. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The cold winds are rising. Mormont feared as much. Benjen Stark felt it as well. Dead </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="570" height="15" font="1">men walk and the trees have eyes again. Why should we balk at wargs and giants?” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Does this mean my dreams are true as well?” asked Squire Dalbridge. “Lord Snow can </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="283" height="15" font="1">keep his mammoths, I want my women.” </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Man and boy I’ve served the Watch, and ranged as far as any,” said Ebben. “I’ve seen </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the bones of giants, and heard many a queer tale, but no more. I want to see them with my </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">own eyes.” </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“Be careful they don’t see you, Ebben,” Stonesnake said. </text>
<text top="673" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ghost did not reappear as they set out again. The shadows covered the floor of the pass </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by then, and the sun was sinking fast toward the jagged twin peaks of the huge mountain the </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rangers named Forktop. <i>If the dream was true . . .</i> Even the thought scared him. Could the </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eagle have hurt Ghost, or knocked him off the precipice? And what about the weirwood with </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="372" height="15" font="1">his brother’s face, that smelled of death and darkness? </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The last ray of sun vanished behind the peaks of Forktop. Twilight filled the Skirling </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Pass. It seemed to grow colder almost at once. They were no longer climbing. In fact, the </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">ground had begun to descend, though as yet not sharply. It was littered with cracks and </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">broken boulders and tumbled heaps of rock. <i>It will be dark soon, and still no sight of Ghost.</i> It </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was tearing Jon apart, yet he dare not shout for the direwolf as he would have liked. Other </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">things might be listening as well. </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“Qhorin,” Squire Dalbridge called softly. “There. Look.” </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The eagle was perched on a spine of rock far above them, outlined against the darkening </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="559" height="15" font="1">sky. <i>We’ve seen other eagles</i>, Jon thought. <i>That need not be the one I dreamed of.</i> </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Even so, Ebben would have loosed a shaft at it, but the squire stopped him. “The bird’s </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">well out of bowshot.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="198" height="15" font="1">“I don’t like it watching us.” </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="550" height="15" font="1">The squire shrugged. “Nor me, but you won’t stop it. Only waste a good arrow.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Qhorin sat in his saddle, studying the eagle for a long time. “We press on,” he finally </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">said. The rangers resumed their descent. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="5"><i>Ghost</i>, Jon wanted to shout, <i>where are you?</i> </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He was about to follow Qhorin and the others when he glimpsed a flash of white between </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">two boulders. <i>A patch of old snow</i>, he thought, until he saw it stir. He was off his horse at </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">once. As he went to his knees, Ghost lifted his head. His neck glistened wetly, but he made no </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">sound when Jon peeled off a glove and touched him. The talons had torn a bloody path </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">through fur and flesh, but the bird had not been able to snap his neck. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="369" height="15" font="1">Qhorin Halfhand was standing over him. “How bad?” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="299" height="15" font="1">As if in answer, Ghost struggled to his feet. </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“The wolf is strong,” the ranger said. “Ebben, water. Stonesnake, your skin of wine. Hold </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">him still, Jon.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Together they washed the caked blood from the direwolf’s fur. Ghost struggled and bared </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his teeth when Qhorin poured the wine into the ragged red gashes the eagle had left him, but </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Jon wrapped his arms around him and murmured soothing words, and soon enough the wolf </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">quieted. By the time they’d ripped a strip from Jon’s cloak to wrap the wounds, full dark had </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">settled. Only a dusting of stars set the black of sky apart from the black of stone. “Do we press </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">on?” Stonesnake wanted to know. </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">Qhorin went to his garron. “Back, not on.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="244" height="15" font="1">“Back?” Jon was taken by surprise. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Eagles have sharper eyes than men. We are seen. So now we run.” The Halfhand wound </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="437" height="15" font="1">a long black scarf around his face and swung up into the saddle. </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The other rangers exchanged a look, but no man thought to argue. One by one they </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mounted and turned their mounts toward home. “Ghost, come,” he called, and the direwolf </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="350" height="15" font="1">followed, a pale shadow moving through the night. </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">All night they rode, feeling their way up the twisting pass and through the stretches of </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">broken ground. The wind grew stronger. Sometimes it was so dark that they dismounted and </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">went ahead on foot, each man leading his garron. Once Ebben suggested that some torches </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">might serve them well, but Qhorin said, “No fire,” and that was the end of that. They reached </text>
<text top="731" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the stone bridge at the summit and began to descend again. Off in the darkness a shadowcat </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">screamed in fury, its voice bouncing off the rocks so it seemed as though a dozen other ‘cats </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">were giving answer. Once Jon thought he saw a pair of glowing eyes on a ledge overhead, as </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">big as harvest moons. </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">In the black hour before dawn, they stopped to let the horses drink and fed them each a </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">handful of oats and a twist or two of hay. “We are not far from the place the wildlings died,” </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">said Qhorin. “From there, one man could hold a hundred. The right man.” He looked at Squire </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">Dalbridge. </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The squire bowed his head. “Leave me as many arrows as you can spare, brothers.” He </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stroked his longbow. “And see my garron has an apple when you’re home. He’s earned it, </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">poor beastie.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="226" height="15" font="5"><i>He’s staying to die</i>, Jon realized. </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Qhorin clasped the squire’s forearm with a gloved hand. “If the eagle flies down for a </text>

<text top="358" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him his chain of office. Tyrion left it on the bedside table. His sister misliked being reminded </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that he was the King’s Hand, and he did not wish to inflame the relations between them any </text>

<text top="422" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Varys caught up with him as he was crossing the yard. “My lord,” he said, a little out of </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">breath. “You had best read this at once.” He held out a parchment in a soft white hand. “A </text>

<text top="486" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“Good news or bad?” Tyrion asked. </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="204" height="15" font="1">“That is not for me to judge.” </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion unrolled the parchment. He had to squint to read the words in the torch-lit yard. </text>
<text top="556" left="139" width="333" height="15" font="1">“Gods be good,” he said softly. “Both of them?” </text>
<text top="581" left="171" width="570" height="15" font="1">“I fear so, my lord. It is so sad. So grievous sad. And them so young and innocent.” </text>
<text top="606" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion remembered how the wolves had howled when the Stark boy had fallen. <i>Are they </i></text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="5"><i>howling now, I wonder?</i> “Have you told anyone else?” he asked. </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">“Not as yet, though of course I must.” </text>
<text top="676" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He rolled up the letter. “I’ll tell my sister.” He wanted to see how she took the news. He </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">wanted that very much. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The queen looked especially lovely that night. She wore a low-cut gown of deep green </text>
<text top="740" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">velvet that brought out the color of her eyes. Her golden hair tumbled across her bare </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shoulders, and around her waist was a woven belt studded with emeralds. Tyrion waited until </text>
<text top="779" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he had been seated and served a cup of wine before thrusting the letter at her. He said not a </text>

<text top="823" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">“I trust you’re pleased,” he said as she read. “You wanted the Stark boy dead, I believe.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei made a sour face. “It was Jaime who threw him from that window, not me. For </text>

<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">portions of every dish, and made certain he ate only what she did. Not that he truly thought </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="331" height="15" font="1">she’d poison him, but it never hurt to be careful. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The news about the Starks had soured her, he could see. “We’ve had no word from </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Bitterbridge?” she asked anxiously as she speared a bit of apple on the point of her dagger and </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">ate it with small, delicate bites. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="60" height="15" font="1">“None.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">“I’ve never trusted Littlefinger. For enough coin, he’d go over to Stannis in a heartbeat.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“Stannis Baratheon is too bloody righteous to buy men. Nor would he make a </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">comfortable lord for the likes of Petyr. This war has made for some queer bedfellows, I agree, </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="140" height="15" font="1">but those two? No.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As he carved some slices off the ham, she said, “We have Lady Tanda to thank for the </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">pig.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="158" height="15" font="1">“A token of her love?” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A bribe. She begs leave to return to her castle. Your leave as well as mine. I suspect she </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="401" height="15" font="1">fears you’ll arrest her on the road, as you did Lord Gyles.” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Does she plan to make off with the heir to the throne?” Tyrion served his sister a cut of </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ham and took one for himself. “I’d sooner she remain. If she wants to feel safe, tell her to </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">bring down her garrison from Stokeworth. As many men as she has.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If we need men so badly, why did you send away your savages?” A certain testiness </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">crept into Cersei’s voice. </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It was the best use I could have made of them,” he told her truthfully. “They’re fierce </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warriors, but not soldiers. In formal battle, discipline is more important than courage. They’ve </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">already done us more good in the kingswood than they would ever have done us on the city </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">walls.” </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">As the swan was being served, the queen questioned him about the conspiracy of the </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Antler Men. She seemed more annoyed than afraid. “Why are we plagued with so many </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="485" height="15" font="1">treasons? What injury has House Lannister ever done these wretches?” </text>
<text top="845" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“None,” said Tyrion, “but they think to be on the winning side . . . which makes them </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">fools as well as traitors.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="286" height="15" font="1">“Are you certain you’ve found them all?” </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“Varys says so.” The swan was too rich for his taste. </text>
<text top="940" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A line appeared on Cersei’s pale white brow, between those lovely eyes. “You put too </text>
<text top="960" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">much trust in that eunuch.” </text>
<text top="985" left="171" width="148" height="15" font="1">“He serves me well.” </text>
<text top="1010" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Or so he’d have you believe. You think you’re the only one he whispers secrets to? He </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gives each of us just enough to convince us that we’d be helpless without him. He played the </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same game with me, when I first wed Robert. For years, I was convinced I had no truer friend </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">at court, but now . . .” She studied his face for a moment. “He says you mean to take the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">Hound from Joffrey.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="396" height="15" font="5"><i>Damn Varys.</i> “I need Clegane for more important duties.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“Nothing is more important than the life of the king.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The life of the king is not at risk. Joff will have brave Ser Osmund guarding him, and </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Meryn Trant as well.” <i>They’re good for nothing better.</i> “I need Balon Swann and the Hound </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">to lead sorties, to make certain Stannis gets no toehold on our side of the Blackwater.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="270" height="15" font="1">“Jaime would lead the sorties himself.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="271" height="15" font="1">“From Riverrun? That’s quite a sortie.” </text>
<text top="313" left="171" width="138" height="15" font="1">“Joff’s only a boy.” </text>
<text top="338" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A boy who wants to be part of this battle, and for once he’s showing some sense. I don’t </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">intend to put him in the thick of the fighting, but he needs to be seen. Men fight more fiercely </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">for a king who shares their peril than one who hides behind his mother’s skirts.” </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="167" height="15" font="1">“He’s <i>thirteen</i>, Tyrion.” </text>
<text top="428" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Remember Jaime at thirteen? If you want the boy to be his father’s son, let him play the </text>
<text top="447" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">part. Joff wears the finest armor gold can buy, and he’ll have a dozen gold cloaks around him </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at all times. If the city looks to be in the least danger of falling, I’ll have him escorted back to </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="161" height="15" font="1">the Red Keep at once.” </text>
<text top="511" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He had thought that might reassure her, but he saw no sign of pleasure in those green </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="175" height="15" font="1">eyes. “<i>Will</i> the city fall?” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No.” <i>But if it does, pray that we can hold the Red Keep long enough for our lord father </i></text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="5"><i>to march to our relief.</i> </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">“You’ve lied to me before, Tyrion.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Always with good reason, sweet sister. I want amity between us as much as you do. I’ve </text>
<text top="645" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">decided to release Lord Gyles.” He had kept Gyles safe for just this gesture. “You can have </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="222" height="15" font="1">Ser Boros Blount back as well.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="598" height="15" font="1">The queen’s mouth tightened. “Ser Boros can rot at Rosby,” she said, “but Tommen—” </text>
<text top="715" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“—stays where he is. He’s safer under Lord Jacelyn’s protection than he would ever have </text>
<text top="734" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">been with Lord Gyles.” </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Serving men cleared away the swan, hardly touched. Cersei beckoned for the sweet. “I </text>
<text top="779" left="139" width="218" height="15" font="1">hope you like blackberry tarts.” </text>
<text top="804" left="171" width="172" height="15" font="1">“I love all sorts of tarts.” </text>
<text top="829" left="171" width="538" height="15" font="1">“Oh, I’ve known that a long while. Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?” </text>
<text top="854" left="171" width="261" height="15" font="1">“Are we playing at riddles now? No.” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="182" height="15" font="1">“He doesn’t have a cock.” </text>
<text top="904" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">“Neither do you.” <i>And don’t you just hate that, Cersei?</i> </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps I’m dangerous too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. </text>
<text top="949" left="139" width="380" height="15" font="1">That worm between your legs does half your thinking.” </text>
<text top="974" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion licked the crumbs off his fingers. He did not like his sister’s smile. “Yes, and just </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="451" height="15" font="1">now my worm is thinking that perhaps it is time I took my leave.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Are you unwell, brother?” She leaned forward, giving him a good look at the top of her </text>
<text top="1038" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">breasts. “Suddenly you appear somewhat flustered.” </text>
</page>
<page number="414" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Flustered?” Tyrion glanced at the door. He thought he’d heard something outside. He </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was beginning to regret coming here alone. “You’ve never shown much interest in my cock </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">before.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It’s not your cock that interests me, so much as what you stick it in. I don’t depend on </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the eunuch for everything, as you do. I have my own ways of finding out things . . . especially </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="298" height="15" font="1">things that people don’t want me to know.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“What are you trying to say?” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">“Only this—<i>I have your little whore.</i>” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion reached for his wine cup, buying a moment to gather his thoughts. “I thought men </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">were more to your taste.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“You’re such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet?” When he gave </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">her no answer she laughed and said, “Father will be ever so relieved.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">His belly felt as if it were full of eels. How had she found Shae? Had Varys betrayed </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him? Or had all his precautions been undone by his impatience the night he rode directly to </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="460" height="15" font="1">the manse? “Why should you care who I choose to warm my bed?” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A Lannister always pays his debts,” she said. “You’ve been scheming against me since </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the day you came to King’s Landing. You sold Myrcella, stole Tommen, and now you plot to </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">have Joff killed. You want him dead so you can rule through Tommen.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Well, I can’t say the notion isn’t tempting.</i> “This is madness, Cersei. Stannis will be here </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">in days. You need me.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="291" height="15" font="1">“For what? Your great prowess in battle?” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="397" height="15" font="1">“Bronn’s sellswords will never fight without me,” he lied. </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Oh, I think they will. It’s your gold they love, not your impish wit. Have no fear, </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">though, they won’t be without you. I won’t say I haven’t thought of slitting your throat from </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="388" height="15" font="1">time to time, but Jaime would never forgive me if I did.” </text>
<text top="659" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“And the whore?” He would not call her by name. <i>If I can convince her Shae means </i></text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="186" height="15" font="5"><i>nothing to me, perhaps . . .</i> </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She’ll be treated gently enough, so long as no harm comes to my sons. If Joff should be </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">killed, however, or if Tommen should fall into the hands of our enemies, your little cunt will </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="351" height="15" font="1">die more painfully than you can possibly imagine.” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>She truly believes I mean to kill my own nephew.</i> “The boys are safe,” he promised her </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wearily. “Gods be good, Cersei, they’re my own blood! What sort of man do you take me </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="39" height="15" font="1">for?” </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="187" height="15" font="1">“A small and twisted one.” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion stared at the dregs on the bottom of his wine cup. <i>What would Jaime do in my </i></text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>place?</i> Kill the bitch, most likely, and worry about the consequences afterward. But Tyrion </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">did not have a golden sword, nor the skill to wield one. He loved his brother’s reckless wrath, </text>
<text top="915" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but it was their lord father he must try and emulate. <i>Stone, I must be stone, I must be Casterly </i></text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>Rock, hard and unmovable. If I fail this test, I had as lief seek out the nearest grotesquerie.</i> </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="354" height="15" font="1">“For all I know, you’ve killed her already,” he said. </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Would you like to see her? I thought you might.” Cersei crossed the room and threw </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="408" height="15" font="1">open the heavy oaken door. “Bring in my brother’s whore.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Osmund’s brothers Osney and Osfryd were peas from the same pod, tall men with </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">hooked noses, dark hair, and cruel smiles. She hung between them, eyes wide and white in her </text>

<page number="415" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">dark face. Blood trickled from her broken lip, and he could see bruises through her torn </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="610" height="15" font="1">clothing. Her hands were bound with rope, and they’d gagged her so she could not speak. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="228" height="15" font="1">“You said she wouldn’t be hurt.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She fought.” Unlike his brothers, Osney Kettleblack was clean-shaven, so the scratches </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="1">showed plainly on his bare cheeks. “Got claws like a shadowcat, this one.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="597" height="15" font="1">“Bruises heal,” said Cersei in a bored tone. “The whore will live. So long as Joff does.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion wanted to laugh at her. It would have been so sweet, so very very sweet, but it </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would have given the game away. <i>You’ve lost, Cersei, and the Kettleblacks are even bigger </i></text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="449" height="15" font="5"><i>fools than Bronn claimed.</i> All he needed to do was say the words. </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Instead he looked at the girl’s face and said, “You swear you’ll release her after the </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">battle?” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="212" height="15" font="1">“If you release Tommen, yes.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He pushed himself to his feet. “Keep her then, but keep her safe. If these animals think </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they can use her . . . well, sweet sister, let me point out that a scale tips two ways.” His tone </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was calm, flat, uncaring; he’d reached for his father’s voice, and found it. “Whatever happens </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to her happens to Tommen as well, and that includes the beatings and rapes.” <i>If she thinks me </i></text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="282" height="15" font="5"><i>such a monster, I’ll play the part for her.</i> </text>
<text top="480" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">Cersei had not expected that. “You would not dare.” </text>
<text top="505" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion made himself smile, slow and cold. Green and black, his eyes laughed at her. </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="174" height="15" font="1">“Dare? I’ll do it myself.” </text>
<text top="550" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His sister’s hand flashed at his face, but he caught her wrist and bent it back until she </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">cried out. Osfryd moved to her rescue. “One more step and I’ll break her arm,” the dwarf </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">warned him. The man stopped. “You remember when I said you’d never hit me again, </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Cersei?” He shoved her to the floor and turned back to the Kettleblacks. “Untie her and </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">remove that gag.” </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The rope had been so tight as to cut off the blood to her hands. She cried out in pain as </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="653" height="15" font="1">the circulation returned. Tyrion massaged her fingers gently until feeling returned. </text>
<text top="692" left="139" width="468" height="15" font="1">“Sweetling,” he said, “you must be brave. I am sorry they hurt you.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="233" height="15" font="1">“I know you’ll free me, my lord.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I will,” he promised, and Alayaya bent over and kissed him on the brow. Her broken </text>

<text top="806" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Her blood still marked him as he looked down at the queen. “I have never liked you, </text>

<text top="968" left="171" width="496" height="15" font="1">“Get out!” was all the answer she could summon. “Get out of my sight!” </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="392" height="15" font="1">Tyrion bowed. “Good night, then. And pleasant dreams.” </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="394" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had not expected her. “What are you doing here?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Laughing, she stroked the chain. “I wanted some hands on my titties . . . but these little </text>

<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“She’s asleep. Sleep’s all she ever wants to do, the great cow. She sleeps and she eats. </text>

<text top="411" left="171" width="205" height="15" font="1">“Her mother says she’s sick.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“She has a baby in her belly, that’s all.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion gazed around the room. Everything seemed much as he left it. “How did you </text>

<text top="505" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She gave a shrug. “Lord Varys made me wear a hood. I couldn’t see, except . . . there </text>

<text top="544" left="139" width="208" height="15" font="1">the kind that make a picture?” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="91" height="15" font="1">“A mosaic?” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Shae nodded. “They were colored red and black. I think the picture was a dragon. </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Otherwise, everything was dark. We went down a ladder and walked a long ways, until I was </text>
<text top="634" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all twisted around. Once we stopped so he could unlock an iron gate. I brushed against it </text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">when we went through. The dragon was past the gate. Then we went up another ladder, with a </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="485" height="15" font="1">tunnel at the top. I had to stoop, and I think Lord Varys was crawling.” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion made a round of the bedchamber. One of the sconces looked loose. He stood on </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his toes and tried to turn it. It revolved slowly, scraping against the stone wall. When it was </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">upside down, the stub of the candle fell out. The rushes scattered across the cold stone floor </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="599" height="15" font="1">did not show any particular disturbance. “Doesn’t m’lord want to bed me?” asked Shae. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“In a moment.” Tyrion threw open his wardrobe, shoved the clothing aside, and pushed </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">against the rear panel. What worked for a whorehouse might work for a castle as well . . . but </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">no, the wood was solid, unyielding. A stone beside the window seat drew his eye, but all his </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">tugging and prodding went for naught. He returned to the bed frustrated and annoyed. </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Shae undid his laces and threw her arms around his neck. “Your shoulders feel as hard as </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rocks,” she murmured. “Hurry, I want to feel you inside me.” Yet as her legs locked around </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his waist, his manhood left him. When she felt him go soft, Shae slid down under the sheets </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="424" height="15" font="1">and took him in her mouth, but even that could not rouse him. </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">After a few moments he stopped her. “What’s wrong?” she asked. All the sweet </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">innocence of the world was written there in the lines of her young face. </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="590" height="15" font="5"><i>Innocence? Fool, she’s a whore, Cersei was right, you think with your cock, fool, fool.</i> </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Just go to sleep, sweetling,” he urged, stroking her hair. Yet long after Shae had taken </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">his advice, Tyrion himself still lay awake, his fingers cupped over one small breast as he </text>

<text top="180" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Great Hall of Riverrun was a lonely place for two to sit to supper. Deep shadows </text>
<text top="199" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">draped the walls. One of the torches had guttered out, leaving only three. Catelyn sat staring </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">into her wine goblet. The vintage tasted thin and sour on her tongue. Brienne was across from </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">her. Between them, her father’s high seat was as empty as the rest of the hall. Even the </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">servants were gone. She had given them leave to join the celebration. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The walls of the keep were thick, yet even so, they could hear the muffled sounds of </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">revelry from the yard outside. Ser Desmond had brought twenty casks up from the cellars, and </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the smallfolk were celebrating Edmure’s imminent return and Robb’s conquest of the Crag by </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="222" height="15" font="1">hoisting horns of nut-brown ale. </text>

<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>to see Rickon trying so fiercely to be like his older brothers.</i> She stared at the supper set </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">before her: trout wrapped in bacon, salad of turnip greens and red fennel and sweetgrass, </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pease and onions and hot bread. Brienne was eating methodically, as if supper were another </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chore to be accomplished. <i>I am become a sour woman</i>, Catelyn thought. <i>I take no joy in mead </i></text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>nor meat, and song and laughter have become suspicious strangers to me. I am a creature of </i></text>

<text top="541" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="5"><i>once.</i> </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The sound of the other woman’s eating had become intolerable to her. “Brienne, I am no </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fit company. Go join the revels, if you would. Drink a horn of ale and dance to Rymund’s </text>

<text top="630" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I am not made for revels, my lady.” Her big hands tore apart a heel of black bread. </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Brienne stared at the chunks as if she had forgotten what they were. “If you command it, </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="1">I . . .” </text>
<text top="695" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could sense her discomfort. “I only thought you might enjoy happier company </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="1">than mine.” </text>
<text top="739" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’m well content.” The girl used the bread to sop up some of the bacon grease the trout </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">had been fried in. </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“There was another bird this morning.” Catelyn did not know why she said it. “The </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">maester woke me at once. That was dutiful, but not kind. Not kind at all.” She had not meant </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to tell Brienne. No one knew but her and Maester Vyman, and she had meant to keep it that </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">way until . . . until . . . </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Until what? Foolish woman, will holding it secret in your heart make it any less true? If </i></text>

<text top="906" left="139" width="394" height="15" font="5"><i>half-remembered? Oh, if only the gods would be so good.</i> </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="326" height="15" font="1">“Is it news of King’s Landing?” asked Brienne. </text>
<text top="956" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Would that it was. The bird came from Castle Cerwyn, from Ser Rodrik, my castellan.” </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="5"><i>Dark wings, dark words.</i> “He has gathered what power he could and is marching on </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">Winterfell, to take the castle back.” How unimportant all that sounded now. “But he </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">said . . . he wrote . . . he told me, he . . .” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="1">“My lady, what is it? Is it some news of your sons?” </text>

<page number="418" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Such a simple question that was; would that the answer could be as simple. When </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Catelyn tried to speak, the words caught in her throat. “I have no sons but Robb.” She </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">managed those terrible words without a sob, and for that much she was glad. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="319" height="15" font="1">Brienne looked at her with horror. “My lady?” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Bran and Rickon tried to escape, but were taken at a mill on the Acorn Water. Theon </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Greyjoy has mounted their heads on the walls of Winterfell. Theon Greyjoy, who ate at my </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">table since he was a boy of ten.” <i>I have said it, gods forgive me. I have said it and made it </i></text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="36" height="15" font="5"><i>true.</i> </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Brienne’s face was a watery blur. She reached across the table, but her fingers stopped </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">short of Catelyn’s, as if the touch might be unwelcome. “I . . . there are no words, my lady. </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">My good lady. Your sons, they . . . they’re with the gods now.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Are they?” Catelyn said sharply. “What god would let this happen? Rickon was only a </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">baby. How could he deserve such a death? And Bran . . . when I left the north, he had not </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">opened his eyes since his fall. I had to go before he woke. Now I can never return to him, or </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hear him laugh again.” She showed Brienne her palms, her fingers. “These scars . . . they sent </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a man to cut Bran’s throat as he lay sleeping. He would have died then, and me with him, but </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Bran’s wolf tore out the man’s throat.” That gave her a moment’s pause. “I suppose Theon </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">killed the wolves too. He must have, elsewise . . . I was certain the boys would be safe so long </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as the direwolves were with them. Like Robb with his Grey Wind. But my daughters have no </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="97" height="15" font="1">wolves now.” </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="487" height="15" font="1">The abrupt shift of topic left Brienne bewildered. “Your daughters . . .” </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Sansa was a lady at three, always so courteous and eager to please. She loved nothing so </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">well as tales of knightly valor. Men would say she had my look, but she will grow into a </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">woman far more beautiful than I ever was, you can see that. I often sent away her maid so I </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">could brush her hair myself. She had auburn hair, lighter than mine, and so thick and </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="540" height="15" font="1">soft . . . the red in it would catch the light of the torches and shine like copper.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“And Arya, well . . . Ned’s visitors would oft mistake her for a stableboy if they rode into </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the yard unannounced. Arya was a trial, it must be said. Half a boy and half a wolf pup. </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Forbid her anything and it became her heart’s desire. She had Ned’s long face, and brown hair </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that always looked as though a bird had been nesting in it. I despaired of ever making a lady </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of her. She collected scabs as other girls collect dolls, and would say anything that came into </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her head. I think she must be dead too.” When she said that, it felt as though a giant hand were </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">squeezing her chest. “I want them all dead, Brienne. Theon Greyjoy first, then Jaime </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="1">Lannister and Cersei and the Imp, every one, every one. But my girls . . . my girls will . . .” </text>
<text top="811" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The queen . . . she has a little girl of her own,” Brienne said awkwardly. “And sons too, </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="561" height="15" font="1">of an age with yours. When she hears, perhaps she . . . she may take pity, and . . .” </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Send my daughters back unharmed?” Catelyn smiled sadly. “There is a sweet innocence </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">about you, child. I could wish . . . but no. Robb will avenge his brothers. Ice can kill as dead </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">as fire. <i>Ice</i> was Ned’s greatsword. Valyrian steel, marked with the ripples of a thousand </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">foldings, so sharp I feared to touch it. Robb’s blade is dull as a cudgel compared to Ice. It will </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">not be easy for him to get Theon’s head off, I fear. The Starks do not use headsmen. Ned </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">always said that the man who passes the sentence should swing the blade, though he never </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">took any joy in the duty. But <i>I</i> would, oh, yes.” She stared at her scarred hands, opened and </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">closed them, then slowly raised her eyes. “I’ve sent him wine.” </text>

<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Good.” Catelyn rose abruptly. “Stay, finish your meal in peace. I will send for you later. </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">At midnight.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="137" height="15" font="1">“So late, my lady?” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The dungeons are windowless. One hour is much like another down there, and for me, </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">all hours are midnight.” Her footsteps rang hollowly when Catelyn left the hall. As she </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">climbed to Lord Hoster’s solar, she could hear them outside, shouting, “Tully!” and “A cup! </text>

<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Hoster was deep in sleep. “He had a cup of dreamwine not so long ago, my lady,” </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">Maester Vyman said. “For the pain. He will not know you are here.” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“It makes no matter,” Catelyn said. <i>He is more dead than alive, yet more alive than my </i></text>

<text top="391" left="171" width="514" height="15" font="1">“My lady, is there aught I might do for you? A sleeping draught, perhaps?” </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Thank you, Maester, but no. I will not sleep away my grief. Bran and Rickon deserve </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">better from me. Go and join the celebration, I will sit with my father for a time.” </text>
<text top="461" left="171" width="355" height="15" font="1">“As you will, my lady.” Vyman bowed and left her. </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Lord Hoster lay on his back, mouth open, his breath a faint whistling sigh. One hand </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hung over the edge of the mattress, a pale frail fleshless thing, but warm when she touched it. </text>
<text top="525" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She slid her fingers through his and closed them. <i>No matter how tightly I hold him, I cannot </i></text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="5"><i>keep him here</i>, she thought sadly. <i>Let him go.</i> Yet her fingers would not seem to unbend. </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have no one to talk with, Father,” she told him. “I pray, but the gods do not answer.” </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lightly she kissed his hand. The skin was warm, blue veins branching like rivers beneath his </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pale translucent skin. Outside the greater rivers flowed, the Red Fork and the Tumblestone, </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and they would flow forever, but not so the rivers in her father’s hand. Too soon that current </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would grow still. “Last night I dreamed of that time Lysa and I got lost while riding back from </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Seagard. Do you remember? That strange fog came up and we fell behind the rest of the party. </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Everything was grey, and I could not see a foot past the nose of my horse. We lost the road. </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The branches of the trees were like long skinny arms reaching out to grab us as we passed. </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lysa started to cry, and when I shouted the fog seemed to swallow the sound. But Petyr knew </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="355" height="15" font="1">where we were, and he rode back and found us . . .” </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“But there’s no one to find me now, is there? This time I have to find our own way, and it </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">is hard, so hard.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I keep remembering the Stark words. Winter has come, Father. For me. For me. Robb </text>

<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">iron chair? Surely the land has bled enough. I want my girls back, I want Robb to lay down </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his sword and pick some homely daughter of Walder Frey to make him happy and give him </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sons. I want Bran and Rickon back, I want . . .” Catelyn hung her head. “I <i>want</i>,” she said </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="291" height="15" font="1">once more, and then her words were gone. </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After a time the candle guttered and went out. Moonlight slanted between the slats of the </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shutters, laying pale silvery bars across her father’s face. She could hear the soft whisper of </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his labored breathing, the endless rush of waters, the faint chords of some love song drifting </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">up from the yard, so sad and sweet. “<i>I loved a maid as red as autumn</i>,” Rymund sang, “<i>with </i></text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn never noticed when the singing ended. Hours had passed, yet it seemed only a </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">heartbeat before Brienne was at the door. “My lady,” she announced softly. “Midnight has </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">come.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="594" height="15" font="5"><i>Midnight has come, Father</i>, she thought, <i>and I must do my duty.</i> She let go of his hand. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The gaoler was a furtive little man with broken veins in his nose. They found him bent </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">over a tankard of ale and the remains of a pigeon pie, more than a little drunk. He squinted at </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them suspiciously. “Begging your forgiveness, m’lady, but Lord Edmure says no one is to see </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="449" height="15" font="1">the Kingslayer without a writing from him, with his seal upon it.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="397" height="15" font="1">“<i>Lord</i> Edmure? Has my father died, and no one told me?” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">The gaoler licked his lips. “No, m’lady, not as I knows.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You will open the cell, or you will come with me to Lord Hoster’s solar and tell him </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">why you saw fit to defy me.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His eyes fell. “As m’lady says.” The keys were chained to the studded leather belt that </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">girdled his waist. He muttered under his breath as he sorted through them, until he found the </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">one that fit the door to the Kingslayer’s cell. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Go back to your ale and leave us,” she commanded. An oil lamp hung from a hook on </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the low ceiling. Catelyn took it down and turned up the flame. “Brienne, see that I am not </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="79" height="15" font="1">disturbed.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Nodding, Brienne took up a position just outside the cell, her hand resting on the pommel </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="381" height="15" font="1">of her sword. “My lady will call if she has need of me.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Catelyn shouldered aside the heavy wood-and-iron door and stepped into foul darkness. </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">This was the bowels of Riverrun, and smelled the part. Old straw crackled underfoot. The </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">walls were discolored with patches of niter. Through the stone, she could hear the faint rush </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the Tumblestone. The lamplight revealed a pail overflowing with feces in one corner and a </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">huddled shape in another. The flagon of wine stood beside the door, untouched. <i>So much for </i></text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="558" height="15" font="5"><i>that ploy. I ought to be thankful that the gaoler did not drink it himself, I suppose.</i> </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jaime raised his hands to cover his face, the chains around his wrists clanking. “Lady </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stark,” he said, in a voice hoarse with disuse. “I fear I am in no condition to receive you.” </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="129" height="15" font="1">“Look at me, ser.” </text>
<text top="737" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The light hurts my eyes. A moment, if you would.” Jaime Lannister had been allowed </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">no razor since the night he was taken in the Whispering Wood, and a shaggy beard covered </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his face, once so like the queen’s. Glinting gold in the lamplight, the whiskers made him look </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">like some great yellow beast, magnificent even in chains. His unwashed hair fell to his </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shoulders in ropes and tangles, the clothes were rotting on his body, his face was pale and </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">wasted . . . and even so, the power and the beauty of the man were still apparent. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="327" height="15" font="1">“I see you had no taste for the wine I sent you.” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“Such sudden generosity seemed somewhat suspect.” </text>
<text top="909" left="171" width="532" height="15" font="1">“I can have your head off any time I want. Why would I need to poison you?” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Death by poison can seem natural. Harder to claim that my head simply fell off.” He </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">squinted up from the floor, his cat-green eyes slowly becoming accustomed to the light. “I’d </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">invite you to sit, but your brother has neglected to provide me a chair.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="184" height="15" font="1">“I can stand well enough.” </text>
<text top="1024" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Can you? You look terrible, I must say. Though perhaps it’s just the light in here.” He </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was fettered at wrist and ankle, each cuff chained to the others, so he could neither stand nor </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lie comfortably. The ankle chains were bolted to the wall. “Are my bracelets heavy enough </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="547" height="15" font="1">for you, or did you come to add a few more? I’ll rattle them prettily if you like.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You brought this on yourself,” she reminded him. “We granted you the comfort of a </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="531" height="15" font="1">tower cell befitting your birth and station. You repaid us by trying to escape.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A cell is a cell. Some under Casterly Rock make this one seem a sunlit garden. One day </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">perhaps I’ll show them to you.” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>If he is cowed, he hides it well</i>, Catelyn thought. “A man chained hand and foot should </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">keep a more courteous tongue in his mouth, ser. I did not come here to be threatened.” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No? Then surely it was to have your pleasure of me? It’s said that widows grow weary </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of their empty beds. We of the Kingsguard vow never to wed, but I suppose I could still </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">service you if that’s what you need. Pour us some of that wine and slip out of that gown and </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">we’ll see if I’m up to it.” </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Catelyn stared down at him in revulsion. <i>Was there ever a man as beautiful or as vile as </i></text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="495" height="15" font="5"><i>this one?</i> “If you said that in my son’s hearing, he would kill you for it.” </text>
<text top="411" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Only so long as I was wearing these.” Jaime Lannister rattled his chains at her. “We </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="393" height="15" font="1">both know the boy is afraid to face me in single combat.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My son may be young, but if you take him for a fool, you are sadly mistaken . . . and it </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seems to me that you were not so quick to make challenges when you had an army at your </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">back.” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="493" height="15" font="1">“Did the old Kings of Winter hide behind their mothers’ skirts as well?” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="396" height="15" font="1">“I grow weary of this, ser. There are things I must know.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="238" height="15" font="1">“Why should I tell you anything?” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="139" height="15" font="1">“To save your life.” </text>
<text top="620" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“You think I fear death?” That seemed to amuse him. </text>
<text top="645" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You should. Your crimes will have earned you a place of torment in the deepest of the </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">seven hells, if the gods are just.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What gods are those, Lady Catelyn? The trees your husband prayed to? How well did </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they serve him when my sister took his head off?” Jaime gave a chuckle. “If there are gods, </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">why is the world so full of pain and injustice?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="191" height="15" font="1">“Because of men like you.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="317" height="15" font="1">“There are no men like me. There’s only me.” </text>
<text top="804" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>There is nothing here but arrogance and pride, and the empty courage of a madman. I </i></text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>am wasting my breath with this one. If there was ever a spark of honor in him, it is long dead.</i> </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“If you will not speak with me, so be it. Drink the wine or piss in it, ser, it makes no matter to </text>

<text top="887" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Her hand was at the door pull when he said, “Lady Stark.” She turned, waited. “Things </text>
<text top="907" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">go to rust in this damp,” Jaime went on. “Even a man’s courtesies. Stay, and you shall have </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="1">your answers . . . for a price.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="5"><i>He has no shame.</i> “Captives do not set prices.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Oh, you’ll find mine modest enough. Your turnkey tells me nothing but vile lies, and he </text>
<text top="996" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cannot even keep them straight. One day he says Cersei has been flayed, and the next it’s my </text>

<text top="1041" left="171" width="96" height="15" font="1">“Truthfully?” </text>

<page number="422" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Oh, it’s <i>truth</i> you want? Be careful, my lady. Tyrion says that people often claim to </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="375" height="15" font="1">“I am strong enough to hear anything you care to say.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="549" height="15" font="1">“As you will, then. But first, if you’d be so kind . . . the wine. My throat is raw.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Catelyn hung the lamp from the door and moved the cup and flagon closer. Jaime sloshed </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the wine around his mouth before he swallowed. “Sour and vile,” he said, “but it will do.” He </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">put his back to the wall, drew his knees up to his chest, and stared at her. “Your first question, </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">Lady Catelyn?” </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Not knowing how long this game might continue, Catelyn wasted no time. “Are you </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="123" height="15" font="1">Joffrey’s father?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="1">“You would never ask unless you knew the answer.” </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“I want it from your own lips.” </text>
<text top="377" left="171" width="520" height="15" font="1">He shrugged. “Joffrey is mine. As are the rest of Cersei’s brood, I suppose.” </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="285" height="15" font="1">“You admit to being your sister’s lover?” </text>
<text top="428" left="171" width="583" height="15" font="1">“I’ve always loved my sister, and you owe me two answers. Do all my kin still live?” </text>
<text top="453" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“Ser Stafford Lannister was slain at Oxcross, I am told.” </text>
<text top="478" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Jaime was unmoved. “Uncle Dolt, my sister called him. It’s Cersei and Tyrion who </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">concern me. As well as my lord father.” </text>
<text top="522" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“They live, all three.” <i>But not long, if the gods are good.</i> </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="327" height="15" font="1">Jaime drank some more wine. “Ask your next.” </text>
<text top="573" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with anything but a lie. </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">“How did my son Bran come to fall?” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="207" height="15" font="1">“I flung him from a window.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant. <i>If I had a knife, I would kill </i></text>
<text top="662" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>him now</i>, she thought, until she remembered the girls. Her throat constricted as she said, “You </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="382" height="15" font="1">were a knight, sworn to defend the weak and innocent.” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="511" height="15" font="1">“He was weak enough, but perhaps not so innocent. He was spying on us.” </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="157" height="15" font="1">“Bran would not spy.” </text>
<text top="757" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then blame those precious gods of yours, who brought the boy to our window and gave </text>
<text top="776" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">him a glimpse of something he was never meant to see.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Blame the <i>gods?</i>” she said, incredulous. “Yours was the hand that threw him. You </text>
<text top="821" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">meant for him to die.” </text>
<text top="846" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His chains chinked softly. “I seldom fling children from towers to improve their health. </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="199" height="15" font="1">Yes, I meant for him to die.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And when he did not, you knew your danger was worse than ever, so you gave your </text>
<text top="910" left="139" width="457" height="15" font="1">cat’s-paw a bag of silver to make certain Bran would never wake.” </text>
<text top="935" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Did I now?” Jaime lifted his cup and took a long swallow. “I won’t deny we talked of it, </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">but you were with the boy day and night, your maester and Lord Eddard attended him </text>
<text top="974" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">frequently, and there were guards, even those damned direwolves . . . it would have required </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cutting my way through half of Winterfell. And why bother, when the boy seemed like to die </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you lie to me, this session is at an end.” Catelyn held out her hands, to show him her </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fingers and palms. “The man who came to slit Bran’s throat gave me these scars. You swear </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">you had no part in sending him?” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="212" height="15" font="1">“On my honor as a Lannister.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">“Your honor as a Lannister is worth less than <i>this</i>.” She kicked over the waste pail. Foul-</text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Jaime Lannister backed away from the spill as far as his chains would allow. “I may </text>

<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Believe what you will, Lady Stark, but if I had wanted your Bran dead I would have slain him </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">myself.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="593" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods be merciful, he’s telling the truth.</i> “If you did not send the killer, your sister did.” </text>

<text top="372" left="171" width="159" height="15" font="1">“Then it was the Imp.” </text>
<text top="397" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Tyrion is as innocent as your Bran. <i>He</i> wasn’t climbing around outside of anyone’s </text>

<text top="441" left="171" width="315" height="15" font="1">“Then why did the assassin have his dagger?” </text>
<text top="467" left="171" width="173" height="15" font="1">“What dagger was this?” </text>
<text top="492" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It was so long,” she said, holding her hands apart, “plain, but finely made, with a blade </text>
<text top="511" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Valyrian steel and a dragonbone hilt. Your brother won it from Lord Baelish at the tourney </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">on Prince Joffrey’s name day.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Lannister poured, drank, poured, and stared into his wine cup. “This wine seems to be </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">improving as I drink it. Imagine that. I seem to remember that dagger, now that you describe </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">it. Won it, you say? How?” </text>
<text top="620" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Wagering on you when you tilted against the Knight of Flowers.” Yet when she heard </text>
<text top="639" left="139" width="584" height="15" font="1">her own words Catelyn knew she had gotten it wrong. “No . . . was it the other way?” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tyrion always backed me in the lists,” Jaime said, “but that day Ser Loras unhorsed me. </text>

<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lost . . . but that dagger <i>did</i> change hands, I recall it now. Robert showed it to me that night at </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the feast. His Grace loved to salt my wounds, especially when drunk. And when was he not </text>

<text top="767" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Tyrion Lannister had said much the same thing as they rode through the Mountains of the </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Moon, Catelyn remembered. She had refused to believe him. Petyr had sworn otherwise, </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Petyr who had been almost a brother, Petyr who loved her so much he fought a duel for her </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand . . . and yet if Jaime and Tyrion told the same tale, what did that mean? The brothers had </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">not seen each other since departing Winterfell more than a year ago. “Are you trying to </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="329" height="15" font="1">deceive me?” Somewhere there was a trap here. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ve admitted to shoving your precious urchin out a window, what would it gain me to </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lie about this knife?” He tossed down another cup of wine. “Believe what you will, I’m past </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">caring what people say of me. And it’s my turn. Have Robert’s brothers taken the field?” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="95" height="15" font="1">“They have.” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Now there’s a niggardly response. Give me more than that, or your next answer will be </text>

<text top="1024" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“Stannis marches against King’s Landing,” she said grudgingly. “Renly is dead, </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="581" height="15" font="1">murdered at Bitterbridge by his brother, through some black art I do not understand.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A pity,” Jaime said. “I rather liked Renly, though Stannis is quite another tale. What </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="266" height="15" font="1">“Renly, at first. Now, I could not say.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="243" height="15" font="1">“Your boy must be feeling lonely.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Robb was sixteen a few days past . . . a man grown, and a king. He’s won every battle </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="618" height="15" font="1">he’s fought. The last word we had from him, he had taken the Crag from the Westerlings.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“He hasn’t faced my father yet, has he?” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="338" height="15" font="1">“When he does, he’ll defeat him. As he did you.” </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="288" height="15" font="1">“He took me unawares. A craven’s trick.” </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You dare talk of tricks? Your brother Tyrion sent us cutthroats in envoy’s garb, under a </text>

<text top="363" left="171" width="570" height="15" font="1">“If it were one of your sons in this cell, wouldn’t his brothers do as much for him?” </text>
<text top="389" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>My son has no brothers</i>, she thought, but she would not share her pain with a creature </text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="87" height="15" font="1">such as this. </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Jaime drank some more wine. “What’s a brother’s life when honor is at stake, eh?” </text>
<text top="453" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Another sip. “Tyrion is clever enough to realize that your son will never consent to ransom </text>
<text top="472" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Catelyn could not deny it. “Robb’s bannermen would sooner see you dead. Rickard </text>
<text top="517" left="139" width="511" height="15" font="1">Karstark in particular. You slew two of his sons in the Whispering Wood.” </text>
<text top="542" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The two with the white sunburst, were they?” Jaime gave a shrug. “If truth be told, it </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was <i>your</i> son that I was trying to slay. The others got in my way. I killed them in fair fight, in </text>
<text top="581" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">the heat of battle. Any other knight would have done the same.” </text>
<text top="606" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“How can you still count yourself a knight, when you have forsaken every vow you ever </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="60" height="15" font="1">swore?” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jaime reached for the flagon to refill his cup. “So many vows . . . they make you swear </text>
<text top="670" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and swear. Defend the king. Obey the king. Keep his secrets. Do his bidding. Your life for his. </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">But obey your father. Love your sister. Protect the innocent. Defend the weak. Respect the </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gods. Obey the laws. It’s too much. No matter what you do, you’re forsaking one vow or the </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">other.” He took a healthy swallow of wine and closed his eyes for an instant, leaning his head </text>
<text top="748" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">back against the patch of niter on the wall. “I was the youngest man ever to wear the white </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">cloak.” </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">“And the youngest to betray all it stood for, Kingslayer.” </text>
<text top="818" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Kingslayer</i>,” he pronounced carefully. “And such a king he was!” He lifted his cup. “To </text>
<text top="837" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and <i>Protector</i> of the </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Realm. And to the sword that opened his throat. A <i>golden</i> sword, don’t you know. Until his </text>
<text top="876" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">blood ran red down the blade. Those are the Lannister colors, red and gold.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As he laughed, she realized the wine had done its work; Jaime had drained most of the </text>
<text top="921" left="139" width="549" height="15" font="1">flagon, and he was drunk. “Only a man like you would be proud of such an act.” </text>
<text top="946" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I told you, there are no men like me. Answer me this, Lady Stark—did your Ned ever </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“They strangled Brandon while his father watched, and then killed Lord Rickard as </text>
<text top="1010" left="139" width="521" height="15" font="1">well.” An ugly tale, and sixteen years old. Why was he asking about it now? </text>
<text top="1035" left="171" width="164" height="15" font="1">“Killed, yes, but <i>how?</i>” </text>
<text top="1060" left="171" width="228" height="15" font="1">“The cord or the axe, I suppose.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jaime took a swallow, wiped his mouth. “No doubt Ned wished to spare you. His sweet </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="295" height="15" font="1">“Dead is dead.” <i>I do not want to know this.</i> </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Brandon was different from his brother, wasn’t he? He had blood in his veins instead of </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="228" height="15" font="1">“Brandon was nothing like you.” </text>
<text top="263" left="171" width="284" height="15" font="1">“If you say so. You and he were to wed.” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He was on his way to Riverrun when . . .” Strange, how telling it still made her throat </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">grow tight, after all these years. “. . . when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King’s </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Landing instead. It was a rash thing to do.” She remembered how her own father had raged </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">when the news had been brought to Riverrun. <i>The gallant fool</i>, was what he called Brandon. </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Jaime poured the last half-cup of wine. “He rode into the Red Keep with a few </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">companions, shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die. But Rhaegar wasn’t there. </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son’s murder. The others were lords’ </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">sons too, it seems to me.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Ethan Glover was Brandon’s squire,” Catelyn said. “He was the only one to survive. </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The others were Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce, and Elbert Arryn, Jon Arryn’s nephew and </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heir.” It was queer how she still remembered the names, after so many years. “Aerys accused </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them of treason and summoned their fathers to court to answer the charge, with the sons as </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="1">hostages. When they came, he had them murdered without trial. Fathers and sons both.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“There were trials. Of a sort. Lord Rickard demanded trial by combat, and the king </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">granted the request. Stark armored himself as for battle, thinking to duel one of the </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Kingsguard. Me, perhaps. Instead they took him to the throne room and suspended him from </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the rafters while two of Aerys’s pyromancers kindled a blaze beneath him. The king told him </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that  <i>fire</i> was the champion of House Targaryen. So all Lord Rickard needed to do to prove </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">himself innocent of treason was . . . well, not burn.” </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When the fire was blazing, Brandon was brought in. His hands were chained behind his </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back, and around his neck was a wet leathern cord attached to a device the king had brought </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from Tyrosh. His legs were left free, though, and his longsword was set down just beyond his </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">reach.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The pyromancers roasted Lord Rickard slowly, banking and fanning that fire carefully </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to get a nice even heat. His cloak caught first, and then his surcoat, and soon he wore nothing </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">but metal and ashes. Next he would start to cook, Aerys promised . . . unless his son could </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">free him. Brandon tried, but the more he struggled, the tighter the cord constricted around his </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">throat. In the end he strangled himself.” </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“As for Lord Rickard, the steel of his breastplate turned cherry-red before the end, and </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his gold melted off his spurs and dripped down into the fire. I stood at the foot of the Iron </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Throne in my white armor and white cloak, filling my head with thoughts of Cersei. After, </text>

<text top="965" left="139" width="53" height="15" font="1">agree.” </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aerys . . .” Catelyn could taste bile at the back of her throat. The story was so hideous </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she suspected it had to be true. “Aerys was mad, the whole realm knew it, but if you would </text>

<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">laughing, and the howl came again. He could smell the hot breath of the beasts behind him, a </text>

<text top="995" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Past time,” Theon muttered, pushing his fingers through his hair. He had begun to fear </text>

<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">All his dreams had been cold of late, and each more hideous than the one before. Last </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">night he had dreamed himself back in the mill again, on his knees dressing the dead. Their </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">limbs were already stiffening, so they seemed to resist sullenly as he fumbled at them with </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">half-frozen fingers, tugging up breeches and knotting laces, yanking fur-trimmed boots over </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hard unbending feet, buckling a studded leather belt around a waist no bigger than the span of </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his hands. “This was never what I wanted,” he told them as he worked. “They gave me no </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="496" height="15" font="1">choice.” The corpses made no answer, but only grew colder and heavier. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The night before, it had been the miller’s wife. Theon had forgotten her name, but he </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remembered her body, soft pillowy breasts and stretch marks on her belly, the way she clawed </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his back when he fucked her. Last night in his dream he had been in bed with her once again, </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">but this time she had teeth above <i>and</i> below, and she tore out his throat even as she was </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gnawing off his manhood. It was madness. He’d seen her die too. Gelmarr had cut her down </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with one blow of his axe as she cried to Theon for mercy. <i>Leave me, woman. It was him who </i></text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="5"><i>killed you, not me. And he’s dead as well.</i> At least Gelmarr did not haunt Theon’s sleep. </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The dream had receded by the time Wex returned with the water. Theon washed the </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sweat and sleep from his body and took his own good time dressing. Asha had let him wait </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">long enough; now it was her turn. He chose a satin tunic striped black and gold and a fine </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">leather jerkin with silver studs . . . and only then remembered that his wretched sister put </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">more stock in blades than beauty. Cursing, he tore off the clothes and dressed again, in felted </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">black wool and ringmail. Around his waist he buckled sword and dagger, remembering the </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">night she had humiliated him at his own father’s table. <i>Her sweet suckling babe, yes. Well, I </i></text>
<text top="653" left="139" width="280" height="15" font="5"><i>have a knife too, and know how to use it.</i> </text>
<text top="678" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Last of all, he donned his crown, a band of cold iron slim as a finger, set with heavy </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chunks of black diamond and nuggets of gold. It was misshapen and ugly, but there was no </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">help for that. Mikken lay buried in the lichyard, and the new smith was capable of little more </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">than nails and horseshoes. Theon consoled himself with the reminder that it was only a </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">prince’s crown. He would have something much finer when he was crowned king. </text>
<text top="781" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Outside his door, Reek waited with Urzen and Kromm. Theon fell in with them. These </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">days, he took guards with him everywhere he went, even to the privy. Winterfell wanted him </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">dead. The very night they had returned from Acorn Water, Gelmarr the Grim had tumbled </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">down some steps and broken his back. The next day, Aggar turned up with his throat slit ear </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to ear. Gynir Rednose became so wary that he shunned wine, took to sleeping in byrnie, coif, </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and helm, and adopted the noisiest dog in the kennels to give him warning should anyone try </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to steal up on his sleeping place. All the same, one morning the castle woke to the sound of </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the little dog barking wildly. They found the pup racing around the well, and Rednose floating </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="103" height="15" font="1">in it, drowned. </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He could not let the killings go unpunished. Farlen was as likely a suspect as any, so </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Theon sat in judgment, called him guilty, and condemned him to death. Even that went sour. </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">As he knelt to the block, the kennelmaster said, “M’lord Eddard always did his own killings.” </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon had to take the axe himself or look a weakling. His hands were sweating, so the shaft </text>
<text top="1039" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">twisted in his grip as he swung and the first blow landed between Farlen’s shoulders. It took </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">three more cuts to hack through all that bone and muscle and sever the head from the body, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and afterward he was sick, remembering all the times they’d sat over a cup of mead talking of </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hounds and hunting. <i>I had no choice</i>, he wanted to scream at the corpse. <i>The ironborn can’t </i></text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>keep secrets, they had to die, and someone had to take the blame for it.</i> He only wished he had </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="641" height="15" font="1">killed him cleaner. Ned Stark had never needed more than a single blow to take a man’s head. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The killings stopped after Farlen’s death, but even so his men continued sullen and </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">anxious. “They fear no foe in open battle,” Black Lorren told him, “but it is another thing to </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dwell among enemies, never knowing if the washerwoman means to kiss you or kill you, or </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">whether the serving boy is filling your cup with ale or bale. We would do well to leave this </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">place.” </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am the Prince of Winterfell!” Theon had shouted. “This is my seat, no man will drive </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">me from it. No, nor woman either!” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>Asha. It was her doing. My own sweet sister, may the Others bugger her with a sword.</i> </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She wanted him dead, so she could steal his place as their father’s heir. That was why she had </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">let him languish here, ignoring the urgent commands he had sent her. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He found her in the high seat of the Starks, ripping a capon apart with her fingers. The </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hall rang with the voices of her men, sharing stories with Theon’s own as they drank together. </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">They were so loud that his entrance went all but unnoticed. “Where are the rest?” he </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">demanded of Reek. There were no more than fifty men at the trestle tables, most of them his. </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="437" height="15" font="1">Winterfell’s Great Hall could have seated ten times the number. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“This is the whole o’ the company, m’lord prince.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="312" height="15" font="1">“The <i>whole</i>—how many men did she bring?” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="168" height="15" font="1">“Twenty, by my count.” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon Greyjoy strode to where his sister was sprawled. Asha was laughing at something </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one of her men had said, but broke off at his approach. “Why, ‘tis the Prince of Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She tossed a bone to one of the dogs sniffing about the hall. Under that hawk’s beak of a nose, </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">her wide mouth twisted in a mocking grin. “Or is it Prince of Fools?” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="191" height="15" font="1">“Envy ill becomes a maid.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Asha sucked grease from her fingers. A lock of black hair fell across her eyes. Her men </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were shouting for bread and bacon. They made a deal of noise, as few as they were. “Envy, </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="62" height="15" font="1">Theon?” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“What else would you call it? With thirty men, I captured Winterfell in a night. You </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">needed a thousand and a moon’s turn to take Deepwood Motte.” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, I’m no great warrior like you, brother,” She quaffed half a horn of ale and wiped </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her mouth with the back of her hand. “I saw the heads above your gates. Tell me true, which </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="384" height="15" font="1">one gave you the fiercest fight, the cripple or the babe?” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon could feel the blood rushing to his face. He took no joy from those heads, no more </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than he had in displaying the headless bodies of the children before the castle. Old Nan stood </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with her soft toothless mouth opening and closing soundlessly, and Farlen threw himself at </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Theon, snarling like one of his hounds. Urzen and Cadwyl had to beat him senseless with the </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">butts of their spears. <i>How did I come to this?</i> he remembered thinking as he stood over the </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">fly-speckled bodies. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Only Maester Luwin had the stomach to come near. Stone-faced, the small grey man had </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">begged leave to sew the boys’ heads back onto their shoulders, so they might be laid in the </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="270" height="15" font="1">crypts below with the other Stark dead. </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="305" height="15" font="1">“No,” Theon had told him. “Not the crypts.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“But why, my lord? Surely they cannot harm you now. It is where they belong. All the </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I said <i>no</i>.” He needed the heads for the wall, but he had burned the headless bodies that </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">very day, in all their finery. Afterward he had knelt amongst the bones and ashes to retrieve a </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">slag of melted silver and cracked jet, all that remained of the wolf’s-head brooch that had </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="226" height="15" font="1">once been Bran’s. He had it still. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I treated Bran and Rickon generously,” he told his sister. “They brought their fate on </text>

<text top="277" left="171" width="201" height="15" font="1">“As do we all, little brother.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His patience was at an end. “How do you expect me to hold Winterfell if you bring me </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">only twenty men?” </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ten,” Asha corrected. “The others return with me. You wouldn’t want your own sweet </text>

<text top="386" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">prowling the dark.” She uncoiled from the great stone seat and rose to her feet. “Come, let us </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">go somewhere we can speak more privily.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She was right, he knew, though it galled him that she would make that decision. <i>I should </i></text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="588" height="15" font="5"><i>never have come to the hall</i>, he realized belatedly. <i>I should have summoned her to me.</i> </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was too late for that now, however. Theon had no choice but to lead Asha to Ned </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stark’s solar. There, before the ashes of a dead fire, he blurted, “Dagmer’s lost the fight at </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">Torrhen’s Square—” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The old castellan broke his shield wall, yes,” Asha said calmly. “What did you expect? </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">This Ser Rodrik knows the land intimately, as the Cleftjaw does not, and many of the </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">northmen were mounted. The ironborn lack the discipline to stand a charge of armored horse. </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Dagmer lives, be grateful for that much. He’s leading the survivors back toward the Stony </text>

<text top="642" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>She knows more than I do</i>, Theon realized. That only made him angrier. “The victory has </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">given Leobald Tallhart the courage to come out from behind his walls and join Ser Rodrik. </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">And I’ve had reports that Lord Manderly has sent a dozen barges upriver packed with knights, </text>

<text top="745" left="171" width="243" height="15" font="1">“I need not have brought you any.” </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="158" height="15" font="1">“I commanded you—” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Father</i> commanded me to take Deepwood Motte,” she snapped. “He said nothing of me </text>

<text top="840" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Bugger Deepwood,” he said. “It’s a wooden pisspot on a hill. Winterfell is the heart of </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">the land, but how am I to hold it without a garrison?” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You might have thought of that before you took it. Oh, it was cleverly done, I’ll grant </text>

<text top="948" left="171" width="529" height="15" font="1">“You’d like that, wouldn’t you? To see my prize reduced to ruins and ashes.” </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your prize will be the doom of you. Krakens rise from the <i>sea</i>, Theon, or did you forget </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mistake. You made certain of that when you mounted those heads on your gatehouse.” Asha </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="482" height="15" font="1">shook her head. “How could you be such a bloody fool? <i>Children . . .</i>” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>They defied me!</i>” he shouted in her face. “And it was blood for blood besides, two sons </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Eddard Stark to pay for Rodrik and Maron.” The words tumbled out heedlessly, but Theon </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="566" height="15" font="1">knew at once that his father would approve. “I’ve laid my brothers’ ghosts to rest.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Our</i> brothers,” Asha reminded him, with a half smile that suggested she took his talk of </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">vengeance well salted. “Did you bring their ghosts from Pyke, brother? And here I thought </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">they haunted only Father.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“When has a maid ever understood a man’s need for revenge?” Even if his father did not </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="1">appreciate the gift of Winterfell, he <i>must</i> approve of Theon avenging his brothers! </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Asha snorted back a laugh. “This Ser Rodrik may well feel the same manly need, did you </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">think of that? You are blood of my blood, Theon, whatever else you may be. For the sake of </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the mother who bore us both, return to Deepwood Motte with me. Put Winterfell to the torch </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">and fall back while you still can.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="507" height="15" font="1">“No.” Theon adjusted his crown. “I took this castle and I mean to hold it.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His sister looked at him a long time. “Then hold it you shall,” she said, “for the rest of </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">your life.” She sighed. “I say it tastes like folly, but what would a shy maid know of such </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">things?” At the door she gave him one last mocking smile. “You ought to know, that’s the </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="439" height="15" font="1">ugliest crown I’ve ever laid eyes on. Did you make it yourself?” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She left him fuming, and lingered no longer than was needful to feed and water her </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">horses. Half the men she’d brought returned with her as threatened, riding out the same </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="425" height="15" font="1">Hunter’s Gate that Bran and Rickon had used for their escape. </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon watched them go from atop the wall. As his sister vanished into the mists of the </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">wolfswood he found himself wondering why he had not listened and gone with her. </text>
<text top="622" left="171" width="281" height="15" font="1">“Gone, has she?” Reek was at his elbow. </text>
<text top="647" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon had not heard him approach, nor smelled him either. He could not think of anyone </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">he wanted to see less. It made him uneasy to see the man walking around breathing, with what </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">he knew. <i>I should have had him killed after he did the others</i>, he reflected, but the notion </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">made him nervous. Unlikely as it seemed, Reek could read and write, and he was possessed of </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">enough base cunning to have hidden an account of what they’d done. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“M’lord prince, if you’ll pardon me saying, it’s not right for her to abandon you. And ten </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">men, that won’t be near enough.” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="357" height="15" font="1">“I am well aware of that,” Theon said. <i>So was Asha.</i> </text>
<text top="820" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Well, might be I could help you,” said Reek. “Give me a horse and bag o’ coin, and I </text>
<text top="840" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">could find you some good fellows.” </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="280" height="15" font="1">Theon narrowed his eyes. “How many?” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A hundred, might be. Two hundred. Maybe more.” He smiled, his pale eyes glinting. “I </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">was born up north here. I know many a man, and many a man knows Reek.” </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Two hundred men were not an army, but you didn’t need thousands to hold a castle as </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">strong as Winterfell. So long as they could learn which end of a spear did the killing, they </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">might make all the difference. “Do as you say and you’ll not find me ungrateful. You can </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="173" height="15" font="1">name your own reward.” </text>
<text top="1018" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Well, m’lord, I haven’t had no woman since I was with Lord Ramsay,” Reek said. “I’ve </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Reek was gone before the sun went down, carrying a bag of Stark silver and the last of </text>

<text top="188" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">the chance had to be taken. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">That night he dreamed of the feast Ned Stark had thrown when King Robert came to </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Winterfell. The hall rang with music and laughter, though the cold winds were rising outside. </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">At first it was all wine and roast meat, and Theon was making japes and eyeing the serving </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">girls and having himself a fine time . . . until he noticed that the room was growing darker. </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The music did not seem so jolly then; he heard discords and strange silences, and notes that </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hung in the air bleeding. Suddenly the wine turned bitter in his mouth, and when he looked up </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="369" height="15" font="1">from his cup he saw that he was dining with the dead. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">King Robert sat with his guts spilling out on the table from the great gash in his belly, </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and Lord Eddard was headless beside him. Corpses lined the benches below, grey-brown flesh </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sloughing off their bones as they raised their cups to toast, worms crawling in and out of the </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">holes that were their eyes. He knew them, every one; Jory Cassel and Fat Tom, Porther and </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Cayn and Hullen the master of horse, and all the others who had ridden south to King’s </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Landing never to return. Mikken and Chayle sat together, one dripping blood and the other </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">water. Benfred Tallhart and his Wild Hares filled most of a table. The miller’s wife was there </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as well, and Farlen, even the wildling Theon had killed in the wolfswood the day he had saved </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">Bran’s life. </text>
<text top="536" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But there were others with faces he had never known in life, faces he had seen only in </text>

<text top="575" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">gore could only be Lyanna. Her brother Brandon stood beside her, and their father Lord </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Rickard just behind. Along the walls figures half-seen moved through the shadows, pale </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shades with long grim faces. The sight of them sent fear shivering through Theon sharp as a </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knife. And then the tall doors opened with a crash, and a freezing gale blew down the hall, </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Robb came walking out of the night. Grey Wind stalked beside, eyes burning, and man </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="385" height="15" font="1">and wolf alike bled from half a hundred savage wounds. </text>
<text top="697" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon woke with a scream, startling Wex so badly that the boy ran naked from the room. </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">When his guards burst in with drawn swords, he ordered them to bring him the maester. By </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the time Luwin arrived rumpled and sleepy, a cup of wine had steadied Theon’s hands, and he </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was feeling ashamed of his panic. “A dream,” he muttered, “that was all it was. It meant </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">nothing.” </text>
<text top="800" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Nothing,” Luwin agreed solemnly. He left a sleeping draught, but Theon poured it down </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the privy shaft the moment he was gone. Luwin was a man as well as a maester, and the man </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had no love for him. <i>He wants me to sleep, yes . . . to sleep and never wake. He’d like that as </i></text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="148" height="15" font="5"><i>much as Asha would.</i> </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He sent for Kyra, kicked shut the door, climbed on top of her, and fucked the wench with </text>

<text top="967" left="171" width="234" height="15" font="1">Yet even then, he could not sleep. </text>
<text top="992" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Come dawn, he dressed and went outside, to walk along the outer walls. A brisk autumn </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wind was swirling through the battlements. It reddened his cheeks and stung his eyes. He </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">watched the forest go from grey to green below him as light filtered through the silent trees. </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">On his left he could see tower-tops above the inner wall, their roofs gilded by the rising sun. </text>

<text top="656" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">steel icy-bright. When Tyrion saw her he turned his horse her way. “Lady Sansa,” he called </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">from the saddle, “surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="84" height="15" font="1">Maegor’s?” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She has, my lord, but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off. I mean to visit the sept as </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="101" height="15" font="1">well, to pray.” </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I won’t ask for whom.” His mouth twisted oddly; if that was a smile, it was the queerest </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she had ever seen. “This day may change all. For you as well as for House Lannister. I ought </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to have sent you off with Tommen, now that I think on it. Still, you should be safe enough in </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="170" height="15" font="1">Maegor’s, so long as—” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="579" height="15" font="1">“<i>Sansa!</i>” The boyish shout rang across the yard; Joffrey had seen her. “Sansa, here!” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="359" height="15" font="5"><i>He calls me as if he were calling a dog</i>, she thought. </text>
<text top="898" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“His Grace has need of you,” Tyrion Lannister observed. “We’ll talk again after the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">battle, if the gods permit.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa threaded her way through the file of gold-cloaked spearmen as Joffrey beckoned </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="361" height="15" font="1">her closer. “It will be battle soon, everyone says so.” </text>
<text top="987" left="171" width="260" height="15" font="1">“May the gods have mercy on us all.” </text>
<text top="1012" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“My uncle’s the one who will need mercy, but I won’t give him any.” Joffrey drew his </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sword. The pommel was a ruby cut in the shape of a heart, set between a lion’s jaws. Three </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">fullers were deeply incised in the blade. “My new blade, Hearteater.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He’d owned a sword named Lion’s Tooth once, Sansa remembered. Arya had taken it </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from him and thrown it in a river. <i>I hope Stannis does the same with this one.</i> “It is beautifully </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">wrought, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="556" height="15" font="1">“Bless my steel with a kiss.” He extended the blade down to her. “Go on, kiss it.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He had never sounded more like a stupid little boy. Sansa touched her lips to the metal, </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thinking that she would kiss any number of swords sooner than Joffrey. The gesture seemed </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to please him, though. He sheathed the blade with a flourish. “You’ll kiss it again when I </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">return, and taste my uncle’s blood.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Only if one of your Kingsguard kills him for you.</i> Three of the White Swords would go </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with Joffrey and his uncle: Ser Meryn, Ser Mandon, and Ser Osmund Kettleblack. “Will you </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="356" height="15" font="1">lead your knights into battle?” Sansa asked, hoping. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I would, but my uncle the Imp says my uncle Stannis will never cross the river. I’ll </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">command the Three Whores, though. I’m going to see to the traitors myself.” The prospect </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">made Joff smile. His plump pink lips always made him look pouty. Sansa had liked that once, </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="176" height="15" font="1">but now it made her sick. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest,” she said </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="517" height="15" font="1">recklessly. “Though he’s older than Your Grace, to be sure. A man grown.” </text>
<text top="469" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">That made him frown. “I’ll deal with your brother after I’m done with my traitor uncle. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">I’ll gut him with Hearteater, you’ll see.” He wheeled his horse about and spurred toward the </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">gate. Ser Meryn and Ser Osmund fell in to his right and left, the gold cloaks following four </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">abreast. The Imp and Ser Mandon Moore brought up the rear. The guards saw them off with </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shouts and cheers. When the last was gone, a sudden stillness settled over the yard, like the </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">hush before a storm. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Through the quiet, the singing pulled at her. Sansa turned toward the sept. Two </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stableboys followed, and one of the guards whose watch was ended. Others fell in behind </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">them. </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Sansa had never seen the sept so crowded, nor so brightly lit; great shafts of rainbow-</text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">colored sunlight slanted down through the crystals in the high windows, and candles burned </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">on every side, their little flames twinkling like stars. The Mother’s altar and the Warrior’s </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">swam in light, but Smith and Crone and Maid and Father had their worshipers as well, and </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">there were even a few flames dancing below the Stranger’s half-human face . . . for what was </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis Baratheon, if not the Stranger come to judge them? Sansa visited each of the Seven in </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">turn, lighting a candle at each altar, and then found herself a place on the benches between a </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wizened old washer woman and a boy no older than Rickon, dressed in the fine linen tunic of </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a knight’s son. The old woman’s hand was bony and hard with callus, the boy’s small and </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">soft, but it was good to have someone to hold on to. The air was hot and heavy, smelling of </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">incense and sweat, crystal-kissed and candle-bright; it made her dizzy to breathe it. </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She knew the hymn; her mother had taught it to her once, a long time ago in Winterfell. </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="207" height="15" font="1">She joined her voice to theirs. </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="714" height="15" font="5"><i>Gentle Mother, font of mercy, </i></text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Across the city, thousands had jammed into the Great Sept of Baelor on Visenya’s Hill, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and they would be singing too, their voices swelling out over the city, across the river, and up </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="378" height="15" font="1">into the sky. <i>Surely the gods must hear us</i>, she thought. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Sansa knew most of the hymns, and followed along on those she did not know as best she </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could. She sang along with grizzled old serving men and anxious young wives, with serving </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">girls and soldiers, cooks and falconers, knights and knaves, squires and spit boys and nursing </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mothers. She sang with those inside the castle walls and those without, sang with all the city. </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">She sang for mercy, for the living and the dead alike, for Bran and Rickon and Robb, for her </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sister Arya and her bastard brother Jon Snow, away off on the Wall. She sang for her mother </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and her father, for her grandfather Lord Hoster and her uncle Edmure Tully, for her friend </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jeyne Poole, for old drunken King Robert, for Septa Mordane and Ser Dontos and Jory Cassel </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Maester Luwin, for all the brave knights and soldiers who would die today, and for the </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">children and the wives who would mourn them, and finally, toward the end, she even sang for </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Tyrion the Imp and for the Hound. <i>He is no true knight but he saved me all the same</i>, she told </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="438" height="15" font="1">the Mother. <i>Save him if you can, and gentle the rage inside him.</i> </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">But when the septon climbed on high and called upon the gods to protect and defend </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their true and noble king, Sansa got to her feet. The aisles were jammed with people. She had </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to shoulder through while the septon called upon the Smith to lend strength to Joffrey’s sword </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and shield, the Warrior to give him courage, the Father to defend him in his need. <i>Let his </i></text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>sword break and his shield shatter</i>, Sansa thought coldly as she shoved out through the doors, </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="345" height="15" font="5"><i>let his courage fail him and every man desert him.</i> </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A few guards paced along on the gatehouse battlements, but otherwise the castle seemed </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">empty. Sansa stopped and listened. A way off, she could hear the sounds of battle. The </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">singing almost drowned them out, but the sounds were there if you had the ears to hear: the </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">deep moan of warhorns, the creak and thud of catapults flinging stones, the splashes and </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">splinterings, the crackle of burning pitch and <i>thrum</i> of scorpions loosing their yard-long iron-</text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">headed shafts . . . and beneath it all, the cries of dying men. </text>
<text top="652" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It was another sort of song, a terrible song. Sansa pulled the hood of her cloak up over </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her ears, and hurried toward Maegor’s Holdfast, the castle-within-a-castle where the queen </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had promised they would all be safe. At the foot of the drawbridge, she came upon Lady </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Tanda and her two daughters. Falyse had arrived yesterday from Castle Stokeworth with a </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">small troop of soldiers. She was trying to coax her sister onto the bridge, but Lollys clung to </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="471" height="15" font="1">her maid, sobbing, “I don’t want to, I don’t want to, I don’t want to.” </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="389" height="15" font="1">“The battle is <i>begun</i>,” Lady Tanda said in a brittle voice. </text>
<text top="800" left="171" width="232" height="15" font="1">“I don’t want to, I don’t want to.” </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There was no way Sansa could avoid them. She greeted them courteously. “May I be of </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="48" height="15" font="1">help?” </text>
<text top="870" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Lady Tanda flushed with shame. “No, my lady, but we thank you kindly. You must </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="308" height="15" font="1">forgive my daughter, she has not been well.” </text>
<text top="914" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I don’t want to.” Lollys clutched at her maid, a slender, pretty girl with short dark hair </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">who looked as though she wanted nothing so much as to shove her mistress into the dry moat, </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="383" height="15" font="1">onto those iron spikes. “Please, please, I don’t want to.” </text>
<text top="978" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa spoke to her gently. “We’ll all be thrice protected inside, and there’s to be food </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">and drink and song as well.” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lollys gaped at her, mouth open. She had dull brown eyes that always seemed to be wet </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="198" height="15" font="1">with tears. “I don’t want to.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You <i>have</i> to,” her sister Falyse said sharply, “and that is the end of it. Shae, help me.” </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">They each took an elbow, and together half dragged and half carried Lollys across the bridge. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="234" height="15" font="1">Sansa followed with their mother. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“She’s been sick,” Lady Tanda said. <i>If a babe can be termed a sickness</i>, Sansa thought. It </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="326" height="15" font="1">was common gossip that Lollys was with child. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The two guards at the door wore the lion-crested helms and crimson cloaks of House </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Lannister, but Sansa knew they were only dressed-up sellswords. Another sat at the foot of the </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stair—a real guard would have been standing, not sitting on a step with his halberd across his </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">knees—but he rose when he saw them and opened the door to usher them inside. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Queen’s Ballroom was not a tenth the size of the castle’s Great Hall, only half as big </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as the Small Hall in the Tower of the Hand, but it could still seat a hundred, and it made up in </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grace what it lacked in space. Beaten silver mirrors backed every wall sconce, so the torches </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">burned twice as bright; the walls were paneled in richly carved wood, and sweet-smelling </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rushes covered the floors. From the gallery above drifted down the merry strains of pipes and </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fiddle. A line of arched windows ran along the south wall, but they had been closed off with </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">heavy draperies. Thick velvet hangings admitted no thread of light, and would muffle the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="582" height="15" font="1">sound of prayer and war alike. <i>It makes no matter</i>, Sansa thought. <i>The war is with us.</i> </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Almost every highborn woman in the city sat at the long trestle tables, along with a </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">handful of old men and young boys. The women were wives, daughters, mothers, and sisters. </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Their men had gone out to fight Lord Stannis. Many would not return. The air was heavy with </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the knowledge. As Joffrey’s betrothed, Sansa had the seat of honor on the queen’s right hand. </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She was climbing the dais when she saw the man standing in the shadows by the back wall. </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">He wore a long hauberk of oiled black mail, and held his sword before him: her father’s </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">greatsword, Ice, near as tall as he was. Its point rested on the floor, and his hard bony fingers </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">curled around the cross-guard on either side of the grip. Sansa’s breath caught in her throat. </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="628" height="15" font="1">Ser Ilyn Payne seemed to sense her stare. He turned his gaunt, pox-ravaged face toward her. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What is <i>he</i> doing here?” she asked Osfryd Kettleblack. He captained the queen’s new </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">red-cloak guard. </text>
<text top="683" left="171" width="584" height="15" font="1">Osfryd grinned. “Her Grace expects she’ll have need of him before the night’s done.” </text>
<text top="708" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Ilyn was the King’s Justice. There was only one service he might be needed for. </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="5"><i>Whose head does she want?</i> </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“All rise for Her Grace, Cersei of House Lannister, Queen Regent and Protector of the </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="223" height="15" font="1">Realm,” the royal steward cried. </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s gown was snowy linen, white as the cloaks of the Kingsguard. Her long dagged </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">sleeves showed a lining of gold satin. Masses of bright yellow hair tumbled to her bare </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shoulders in thick curls. Around her slender neck hung a rope of diamonds and emeralds. The </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">white made her look strangely innocent, almost maidenly, but there were points of color on </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">her cheeks. </text>

<text top="636" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">took pride in that. </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Across the sea warhorns boomed, deep throaty moans like the calls of monstrous </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">serpents, repeated ship to ship. “Bring down the sail,” Davos commanded. “Lower mast. </text>

<text top="926" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Davos knew <i>Fury</i> as well as he knew his own ships. Above her three hundred oars was a </text>

<text top="965" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">enough to fling barrels of burning pitch. A most formidable ship, and very swift as well, </text>

<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The warhorns sounded again, commands drifting back from the <i>Fury</i>. Davos felt a tingle </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">into the water as the oarmaster’s drum began to boom. The sound was like the beating of a </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Wooden wings had sprouted from the <i>Wraith</i> and <i>Lady Marya</i> as well. The three galleys </text>

<text top="265" left="139" width="593" height="15" font="1">mounted the largest ram in the fleet, though Davos had grave doubts about her captain. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He could hear soldiers shouting encouragement to each other across the water. They’d </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been little more than ballast since Storm’s End, and were eager to get at the foe, confident of </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">victory. In that, they were of one mind with their admiral, Lord High Captain Ser Imry </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">Florent. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Three days past, he had summoned all his captains to a war council aboard the <i>Fury</i> </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">while the fleet lay anchored at the mouth of the Wendwater, in order to acquaint them with his </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dispositions. Davos and his sons had been assigned a place in the second line of battle, well </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">out on the dangerous starboard wing. “A place of honor,” Allard had declared, well satisfied </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with the chance to prove his valor. “A place of peril,” his father had pointed out. His sons had </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">given him pitying looks, even young Maric. <i>The Onion Knight has become an old woman</i>, he </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">could hear them thinking, <i>still a smuggler at heart.</i> </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Well, the last was true enough, he would make no apologies for it. <i>Seaworth</i> had a lordly </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ring to it, but down deep he was still Davos of Flea Bottom, coming home to his city on its </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">three high hills. He knew as much of ships and sails and shores as any man in the Seven </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Kingdoms, and had fought his share of desperate fights sword to sword on a wet deck. But to </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">this sort of battle he came a maiden, nervous and afraid. Smugglers do not sound warhorns </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="567" height="15" font="1">and raise banners. When they smell danger, they raise sail and run before the wind. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Had he been admiral, he might have done it all differently. For a start, he would have </text>
<text top="658" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">sent a few of his swiftest ships to probe upriver and see what awaited them, instead of </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">smashing in headlong. When he had suggested as much to Ser Imry, the Lord High Captain </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">had thanked him courteously, but his eyes were not as polite. <i>Who is this lowborn craven?</i> </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="506" height="15" font="1">those eyes asked. <i>Is he the one who bought his knighthood with an onion?</i> </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">With four times as many ships as the boy king, Ser Imry saw no need for caution or </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">deceptive tactics. He had organized the fleet into ten lines of battle, each of twenty ships. The </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">first two lines would sweep up the river to engage and destroy Joffrey’s little fleet, or “the </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">boy’s toys” as Ser Imry dubbed them, to the mirth of his lordly captains. Those that followed </text>
<text top="819" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would land companies of archers and spearmen beneath the city walls, and only then join the </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fight on the river. The smaller, slower ships to the rear would ferry over the main part of </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Stannis’s host from the south bank, protected by Salladhor Saan and his Lyseni, who would </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stand out in the bay in case the Lannisters had other ships hidden up along the coast, poised to </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="180" height="15" font="1">sweep down on their rear. </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">To be fair, there was reason for Ser Imry’s haste. The winds had not used them kindly on </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the voyage up from Storm’s End. They had lost two cogs to the rocks of Shipbreaker Bay on </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the very day they set sail, a poor way to begin. One of the Myrish galleys had foundered in the </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Straits of Tarth, and a storm had overtaken them as they were entering the Gullet, scattering </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the fleet across half the narrow sea. All but twelve ships had finally regrouped behind the </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sheltering spine of Massey’s Hook, in the calmer waters of Blackwater Bay, but not before </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Stannis would have reached the Rush days ago. The kingsroad ran from Storm’s End </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">straight to King’s Landing, a much shorter route than by sea, and his host was largely </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">mounted; near twenty thousand knights, light horse, and freeriders, Renly’s unwilling legacy </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">to his brother. They would have made good time, but armored destriers and twelve-foot lances </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">would avail them little against the deep waters of the Blackwater Rush and the high stone </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">walls of the city. Stannis would be camped with his lords on the south bank of the river, </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">doubtless seething with impatience and wondering what Ser Imry had done with his fleet. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Off Merling Rock two days before, they had sighted a half-dozen fishing skiffs. The </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">fisherfolk had fled before them, but one by one they had been overtaken and boarded. “A </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">small spoon of victory is just the thing to settle the stomach before battle,” Ser Imry had </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">declared happily. “It makes the men hungry for a larger helping.” But Davos had been more </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">interested in what the captives had to say about the defenses at King’s Landing. The dwarf </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had been busy building some sort of boom to close off the mouth of the river, though the </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">fishermen differed as to whether the work had been completed or not. He found himself </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wishing it had. If the river was closed to them, Ser Imry would have no choice but to pause </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="105" height="15" font="1">and take stock. </text>
<text top="427" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The sea was full of sound: shouts and calls, warhorns and drums and the trill of pipes, the </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">slap of wood on water as thousands of oars rose and fell. “<i>Keep line</i>,” Davos shouted. A gust </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of wind tugged at his old green cloak. A jerkin of boiled leather and a pot-helm at his feet </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were his only armor. At sea, heavy steel was as like to cost a man his life as to save it, he </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">believed. Ser Imry and the other highborn captains did not share his view; they glittered as </text>
<text top="524" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="1">they paced their decks. </text>
<text top="549" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>Harridan</i> and <i>Seahorse</i> had slipped into their places now, and Lord Celtigar’s <i>Red Claw</i> </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beyond them. To starboard of Allard’s <i>Lady Marya</i> were the three galleys that Stannis had </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seized from the unfortunate Lord Sunglass, <i>Piety</i>, <i>Prayer</i>, and <i>Devotion</i>, their decks crawling </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with archers. Even <i>Swordfish</i> was closing, lumbering and rolling through a thickening sea </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">under both oars and sail. <i>A ship of that many oars ought to be much faster</i>, Davos reflected </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="514" height="15" font="1">with disapproval. <i>It’s that ram she carries, it’s too big, she has no balance.</i> </text>
<text top="672" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The wind was gusting from the south, but under oars it made no matter. They would be </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sweeping in on the flood tide, but the Lannisters would have the river current to their favor, </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and the Blackwater Rush flowed strong and swift where it met the sea. The first shock would </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">inevitably favor the foe. <i>We are fools to meet them on the Blackwater</i>, Davos thought. In any </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">encounter on the open sea, their battle lines would envelop the enemy fleet on both flanks, </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">driving them inward to destruction. On the river, though, the numbers and weight of Ser </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Imry’s ships would count for less. They could not dress more than twenty ships abreast, lest </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="397" height="15" font="1">they risk tangling their oars and colliding with each other. </text>
<text top="833" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Beyond the line of warships, Davos could see the Red Keep up on Aegon’s High Hill, </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dark against a lemon sky, with the mouth of the Rush opening out below. Across the river the </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">south shore was black with men and horses, stirring like angry ants as they caught sight of the </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">approaching ships. Stannis would have kept them busy building rafts and fletching arrows, yet </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">even so the waiting would have been a hard thing to bear. Trumpets sounded from among </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">them, tiny and brazen, soon swallowed by the roar of a thousand shouts. Davos closed his </text>
<text top="950" left="139" width="638" height="15" font="1">stubby hand around the pouch that held his fingerbones, and mouthed a silent prayer for luck. </text>

<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sneaking in and out of the back of his hand. The squat towers of raw new stone that stood </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">opposite one another at the mouth of the Blackwater might mean nothing to Ser Imry Florent, </text>

<text top="594" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Shading his eyes against the westering sun, he peered at those towers more closely. They </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were too small to hold much of a garrison. The one on the north bank was built against the </text>

<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">It was sunlight on steel, and it told Davos Seaworth all he needed to know. <i>A chain boom . . . </i></text>

<text top="800" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He could make a guess at that as well, but there was no time to consider the question. A </text>

<text top="864" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Between the flashing oars of <i>Sceptre</i> and <i>Faithful</i>, Davos saw a thin line of galleys drawn </text>

<text top="903" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ships as well as he knew his own. When he had been a smuggler, he’d always felt safer </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knowing whether the sail on the horizon marked a fast ship or a slow one, and whether her </text>

<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shouted. On port and starboard he heard Dale and Allard giving the same command. Drums </text>
<text top="1006" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">began to beat furiously, oars rose and fell, and <i>Black Betha</i> surged forward. When he glanced </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">toward <i>Wraith</i>, Dale gave him a salute. <i>Swordfish</i> was lagging once more, wallowing in the </text>

<text top="182" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">which it crouched were steep and rocky, spotted with lichen and gnarled thorny trees. The </text>

<text top="427" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos tasted a trap, yet he saw no sign of any foes sweeping in behind them, only the </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">great fleet of Stannis Baratheon in their ordered ranks, stretching back to the watery horizon. </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Will they raise the chain and cut us in two?</i> He could not see what good that would serve. The </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="612" height="15" font="1">ships left out in the bay could still land men north of the city; a slower crossing, but safer. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A flight of flickering orange birds took wing from the castle, twenty or thirty of them; </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pots of burning pitch, arcing out over the river trailing threads of flame. The waters ate most, </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">but a few found the decks of galleys in the first line of battle, spreading flame when they </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shattered. Men-at-arms were scrambling on <i>Queen Alysanne</i>’s deck, and he could see smoke </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rising from three different spots on <i>Dragonsbane</i>, nearest the bank. By then a second flight </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was on its way, and arrows were falling as well, hissing down from the archers’ nests that </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">studded the towers above. A soldier tumbled over <i>Cat</i>’s gunwale, crashed off the oars, and </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="510" height="15" font="1">sank. <i>The first man to die today</i>, Davos thought, <i>but he will not be the last.</i> </text>
<text top="672" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Atop the Red Keep’s battlements streamed the boy king’s banners: the crowned stag of </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Baratheon on its gold field, the lion of Lannister on crimson. More pots of pitch came flying. </text>

<text top="769" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>It will be our turn soon</i>, he reminded himself, uneasy. <i>Black Betha</i> was well in range of the </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">firepots, being the sixth ship out from the north bank. To starboard, she had only Allard’s </text>

<text top="847" left="139" width="341" height="15" font="1">they could get, placed as vulnerably as they were. </text>
<text top="872" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">As the second line swept past the twin towers, Davos took a closer look. He could see </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">three links of a huge chain snaking out from a hole no bigger than a man’s head and </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">disappearing under the water. The towers had a single door, set a good twenty feet off the </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">ground. Bowmen on the roof of the northern tower were firing down at <i>Prayer</i> and <i>Devotion</i>. </text>
<text top="950" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">The archers on <i>Devotion</i> fired back, and Davos heard a man scream as the arrows found him. </text>
<text top="975" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Captain ser.” His son Matthos was at his elbow. “Your helm.” Davos took it with both </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">hands and slid it over his head. The pot-helm was visorless; he hated having his vision </text>

<text top="1039" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">By then the pitch pots were raining down around them. He saw one shatter on the deck of </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">thrumming. Ahead, the first line was within bowshot of the enemy; flights of arrows flew </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="320" height="15" font="1">between the ships, hissing like striking snakes. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">South of the Blackwater, Davos saw men dragging crude rafts toward the water while </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ranks and columns formed up beneath a thousand streaming banners. The fiery heart was </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">everywhere, though the tiny black stag imprisoned in the flames was too small to make out. </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>We should be flying the crowned stag</i>, he thought. <i>The stag was King Robert’s sigil, the city </i></text>
<text top="266" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="5"><i>would rejoice to see it. This stranger’s standard serves only to set men against us.</i> </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He could not behold the fiery heart without thinking of the shadow Melisandre had </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">birthed in the gloom beneath Storm’s End. <i>At least we fight this battle in the light, with the </i></text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>weapons of honest men</i>, he told himself. The red woman and her dark children would have no </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">part of it. Stannis had shipped her back to Dragonstone with his bastard nephew Edric Storm. </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">His captains and bannermen had insisted that a battlefield was no place for a woman. Only the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">queen’s men had dissented, and then not loudly. All the same, the king had been on the point </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">of refusing them until Lord Bryce Caron said, “Your Grace, if the sorceress is with us, </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">afterward men will say it was her victory, not yours. They will say you owe your crown to her </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">spells.” That had turned the tide. Davos himself had held his tongue during the arguments, but </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">if truth be told, he had not been sad to see the back of her. He wanted no part of Melisandre or </text>

<text top="510" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">To starboard, <i>Devotion</i> drove toward shore, sliding out a plank. Archers scrambled into </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the shallows, holding their bows high over their heads to keep the strings dry. They splashed </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ashore on the narrow strand beneath the bluffs. Rocks came bouncing down from the castle to </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">crash among them, and arrows and spears as well, but the angle was steep and the missiles </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="190" height="15" font="1">seemed to do little damage. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Prayer</i> landed two-dozen yards upstream and <i>Piety</i> was slanting toward the bank when </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the defenders came pounding down the riverside, the hooves of their warhorses sending up </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">gouts of water from the shallows. The knights fell among the archers like wolves among </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chickens, driving them back toward the ships and into the river before most could notch an </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">arrow. Men-at-arms rushed to defend them with spear and axe, and in three heartbeats the </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">scene had turned to blood-soaked chaos. Davos recognized the dog’s-head helm of the Hound. </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">A white cloak streamed from his shoulders as he rode his horse up the plank onto the deck of </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="5"><i>Prayer</i>, hacking down anyone who blundered within reach. </text>
<text top="775" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Beyond the castle, King’s Landing rose on its hills behind the encircling walls. The </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">riverfront was a blackened desolation; the Lannisters had burned everything and pulled back </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">within the Mud Gate. The charred spars of sunken hulks sat in the shallows, forbidding access </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to the long stone quays. <i>We shall have no landing there.</i> He could see the tops of three huge </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trebuchets behind the Mud Gate. High on Visenya’s Hill, sunlight blazed off the seven crystal </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">towers of the Great Sept of Baelor. </text>
<text top="897" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos never saw the battle joined, but he heard it; a great rending crash as two galleys </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">came together. He could not say which two. Another impact echoed over the water an instant </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">later, and then a third. Beneath the screech of splintering wood, he heard the deep <i>thrum-</i></text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>thump</i> of the <i>Fury</i>’s fore catapult. <i>Stag of the Sea</i> split one of Joffrey’s galleys clean in two, </text>

<text top="1020" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Directly ahead, Davos saw the enemy’s <i>Kingslander</i> drive between <i>Faithful</i> and <i>Sceptre</i>. </text>

<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">climbed high into the yellow sky. Each one was as large as a man’s head; when they fell they </text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Black Betha</i> swept upriver, the sound of her oarmaster’s drum thundering in her captain’s </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">head as he looked for a likely victim for her ram. The beleaguered <i>Queen Alysanne</i> was </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="550" height="15" font="1">trapped between two Lannister warships, the three made fast by hooks and lines. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="241" height="15" font="1">“<i>Ramming speed!</i>” Davos shouted. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The drumbeats blurred into a long fevered hammering, and <i>Black Betha</i> flew, the water </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">turning white as milk as it parted for her prow. Allard had seen the same chance; <i>Lady Marya</i> </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ran beside them. The first line had been transformed into a confusion of separate struggles. </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The three tangled ships loomed ahead, turning, their decks a red chaos as men hacked at each </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">other with sword and axe. <i>A little more</i>, Davos Seaworth beseeched the Warrior, <i>bring her </i></text>

<text top="483" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Warrior must have been listening. <i>Black Betha</i> and <i>Lady Marya</i> slammed into the </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">side of <i>Lady’s Shame</i> within an instant of each other, ramming her fore and aft with such </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">force that men were thrown off the deck of <i>Lady of Silk</i> three boats away. Davos almost bit </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his tongue off when his teeth jarred together. He spat out blood. <i>Next time close your mouth, </i></text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>you fool.</i> Forty years at sea, and yet this was the first time he’d rammed another ship. His </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="246" height="15" font="1">archers were loosing arrows at will. </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Back water,” he commanded. When <i>Black Betha</i> reversed her oars, the river rushed into </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the splintered hole she left, and <i>Lady’s Shame</i> fell to pieces before his eyes, spilling dozens of </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">men into the river. Some of the living swam; some of the dead floated; the ones in heavy mail </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and plate sank to the bottom, the quick and the dead alike. The pleas of drowning men echoed </text>

<text top="708" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A flash of green caught his eye, ahead and off to port, and a nest of writhing emerald </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">serpents rose burning and hissing from the stern of <i>Queen Alysanne</i>. An instant later Davos </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="233" height="15" font="1">heard the dread cry of “<i>Wildfire!</i>” </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">He grimaced. Burning pitch was one thing, wildfire quite another. Evil stuff, and well-</text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">nigh unquenchable. Smother it under a cloak and the cloak took fire; slap at a fleck of it with </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">your palm and your hand was aflame. “Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off,” old seamen </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">liked to say. Still, Ser Imry had warned them to expect a taste of the alchemists’ vile </text>

<text top="870" left="139" width="163" height="15" font="1">Imry had assured them. </text>
<text top="895" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Davos reeled off commands; one bank of oars pushed off while the other backed water, </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and the galley came about. <i>Lady Marya</i> had won clear too, and a good thing; the fire was </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">spreading over <i>Queen Alysanne</i> and her foes faster than he would have believed possible. </text>
<text top="953" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Men wreathed in green flame leapt into the water, shrieking like nothing human. On the walls </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of King’s Landing, spitfires were belching death, and the great trebuchets behind the Mud </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gate were throwing boulders. One the size of an ox crashed down between <i>Black Betha</i> and </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Through black smoke and swirling green fire, Davos glimpsed a swarm of small boats </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">bearing downriver: a confusion of ferries and wherries, barges, skiffs, rowboats, and hulks </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that looked too rotten to float. It stank of desperation; such driftwood could not turn the tide </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of a fight, only get in the way. The lines of battle were hopelessly ensnarled, he saw. Off to </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">port,  <i>Lord Steffon</i>,  <i>Ragged Jenna</i>, and <i>Swift Sword</i> had broken through and were sweeping </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">upriver. The starboard wing was heavily engaged, however, and the center had shattered </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">under the stones of those trebuchets, some captains turning downstream, others veering to </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">port, anything to escape that crushing rain. <i>Fury</i> had swung her aft catapult to fire back at the </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">city, but she lacked the range; the barrels of pitch were shattering under the walls. <i>Sceptre</i> had </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">lost most of her oars, and <i>Faithful</i> had been rammed and was starting to list. He took <i>Black </i></text>
<text top="299" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Betha</i> between them, and struck a glancing blow at Queen Cersei’s ornate carved-and-gilded </text>
<text top="318" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pleasure barge, laden with soldiers instead of sweetmeats now. The collision spilled a dozen </text>
<text top="338" left="139" width="602" height="15" font="1">of them into the river, where <i>Betha</i>’s archers picked them off as they tried to stay afloat. </text>
<text top="363" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Matthos’s shout alerted him to the danger from port; one of the Lannister galleys was </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">coming about to ram. “Hard to starboard,” Davos shouted. His men used their oars to push </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">free of the barge, while others turned the galley so her prow faced the onrushing <i>White Hart</i>. </text>
<text top="421" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">For a moment he feared he’d been too slow, that he was about to be sunk, but the current </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">helped swing <i>Black Betha</i>, and when the impact came it was only a glancing blow, the two </text>
<text top="460" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hulls scraping against each other, both ships snapping oars. A jagged piece of wood flew past </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his head, sharp as any spear. Davos flinched. “Board her!” he shouted. Grappling lines were </text>
<text top="499" left="139" width="413" height="15" font="1">flung. He drew his sword and led them over the rail himself. </text>
<text top="524" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The crew of the <i>White Hart</i> met them at the rail, but <i>Black Betha</i>’s men-at-arms swept </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">over them in a screaming steel tide. Davos fought through the press, looking for the other </text>
<text top="563" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">captain, but the man was dead before he reached him. As he stood over the body, someone </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">caught him from behind with an axe, but his helm turned the blow, and his skull was left </text>
<text top="602" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">ringing when it might have been split. Dazed, it was all he could do to roll. His attacker </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">charged screaming. Davos grasped his sword in both hands and drove it up point-first into the </text>
<text top="641" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">man’s belly. </text>
<text top="666" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">One of his crewmen pulled him back to his feet. “Captain ser, the <i>Hart</i> is ours.” It was </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">true, Davos saw. Most of the enemy were dead, dying, or yielded. He took off his helm, wiped </text>
<text top="705" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blood from his face, and made his way back to his own ship, trodding carefully on boards </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">slimy with men’s guts. Matthos lent him a hand to help him back over the rail. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">For those few instants, <i>Black Betha</i> and <i>White Hart</i> were the calm eye in the midst of the </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">storm.  <i>Queen Alysanne</i> and <i>Lady of Silk</i>, still locked together, were a raging green inferno, </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">drifting downriver and dragging pieces of <i>Lady’s Shame</i>. One of the Myrish galleys had </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slammed into them and was now afire as well. <i>Cat</i> was taking on men from the fast-sinking </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Courageous</i>. The captain of <i>Dragonsbane</i> had driven her between two quays, ripping out her </text>

<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">walls. <i>Red Raven</i>, rammed, was slowly listing. <i>Stag of the Sea</i> was fighting fires and boarders </text>
<text top="886" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">both, but the fiery heart had been raised over Joffrey’s <i>Loyal Man</i>.  <i>Fury</i>, her proud bow </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">smashed in by a boulder, was engaged with <i>Godsgrace</i>. He saw Lord Velaryon’s <i>Pride of </i></text>

<text top="945" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">up with fire arrows. On the south bank, knights were leading their mounts aboard the cogs, </text>
<text top="964" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">and some of the smaller galleys were already making their way across, laden with men-at-</text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">arms. They had to thread cautiously between sinking ships and patches of drifting wildfire. </text>
<text top="1003" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The whole of King Stannis’s fleet was in the river now, save for Salladhor Saan’s Lyseni. </text>
<text top="1022" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Soon enough they would control the Blackwater. <i>Ser Imry will have his victory</i>, Davos </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her sails, and some burning pitch had caught in her rigging. The flames spread as Davos </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">watched, creeping out over ropes and sails until she trailed a head of yellow flame. Her </text>

<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">parted the surface of the river before her. Directly ahead, drifting toward her and swinging </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">around to present a tempting plump target, was one of the Lannister hulks, floating low in the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="421" height="15" font="1">water. Slow green blood was leaking out between her boards. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="411" height="15" font="1">When he saw that, Davos Seaworth’s heart stopped beating. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No,” he said. “No, <i>NOOOOOOOO!</i>” Above the roar and crash of battle, no one heard </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him but Matthos. Certainly the captain of the <i>Swordfish</i> did not, intent as he was on finally </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">spearing something with his ungainly fat sword. The <i>Swordfish</i> went to battle speed. Davos </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="536" height="15" font="1">lifted his maimed hand to clutch at the leather pouch that held his fingerbones. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">With a grinding, splintering, tearing crash, <i>Swordfish</i> split the rotted hulk asunder. She </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">burst like an overripe fruit, but no fruit had ever screamed that shattering wooden scream. </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">From inside her Davos saw green gushing from a thousand broken jars, poison from the </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="1">entrails of a dying beast, glistening, shining, spreading across the surface of the river . . . </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Back water,” he roared. “Away. Get us off her, back water, back water!” The grappling </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lines were cut, and Davos felt the deck move under his feet as <i>Black Betha</i> pushed free of </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="318" height="15" font="5"><i>White Hart</i>. Her oars slid down into the water. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Then he heard a short sharp <i>woof</i>, as if someone had blown in his ear. Half a heartbeat </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">later came the roar. The deck vanished beneath him, and black water smashed him across the </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">face, filling his nose and mouth. He was choking, drowning. Unsure which way was up, </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Davos wrestled the river in blind panic until suddenly he broke the surface. He spat out water, </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="485" height="15" font="1">sucked in air, grabbed hold of the nearest chunk of debris, and held on. </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Swordfish</i> and the hulk were gone, blackened bodies were floating downstream beside </text>

<text top="703" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">up,  <i>Kingslander</i> and <i>Godsgrace</i> as well, the demon was eating his own. Lord Velaryon’s </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">shining <i>Pride of Driftmark</i> was trying to turn, but the demon ran a lazy green finger across her </text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">silvery oars and they flared up like so many tapers. For an instant she seemed to be stroking </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="324" height="15" font="1">the river with two banks of long bright torches. </text>
<text top="786" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The current had him in its teeth by then, spinning him around and around. He kicked to </text>

<text top="845" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Blackwater itself seemed to boil in its bed, and burning spars and burning men and pieces of </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">broken ships filled the air. </text>

<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Motionless as a gargoyle, Tyrion Lannister hunched on one knee atop a merlon. Beyond </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the Mud Gate and the desolation that had once been the fishmarket and wharves, the river </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">itself seemed to have taken fire. Half of Stannis’s fleet was ablaze, along with most of </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Joffrey’s. The kiss of wildfire turned proud ships into funeral pyres and men into living </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">torches. The air was full of smoke and arrows and screams. </text>
<text top="347" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Downstream, commoners and highborn captains alike could see the hot green death </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">swirling toward their rafts and carracks and ferries, borne on the current of the Blackwater. </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">The long white oars of the Myrish galleys flashed like the legs of maddened centipedes as </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="564" height="15" font="1">they fought to come about, but it was no good. The centipedes had no place to run. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">A dozen great fires raged under the city walls, where casks of burning pitch had </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">exploded, but the wildfire reduced them to no more than candles in a burning house, their </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">orange and scarlet pennons fluttering insignificantly against the jade holocaust. The low </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">clouds caught the color of the burning river and roofed the sky in shades of shifting green, </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eerily beautiful. <i>A terrible beauty. Like dragonfire.</i> Tyrion wondered if Aegon the Conqueror </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="1">had felt like this as he flew above his Field of Fire. </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The furnace wind lifted his crimson cloak and beat at his bare face, yet he could not turn </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">away. He was dimly aware of the gold cloaks cheering from the hoardings. He had no voice to </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">join them. It was a half victory. <i>It will not be enough.</i> </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He saw another of the hulks he’d stuffed full of King Aerys’s fickle fruits engulfed by </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the hungry flames. A fountain of burning jade rose from the river, the blast so bright he had to </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shield his eyes. Plumes of fire thirty and forty feet high danced upon the waters, crackling and </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hissing. For a few moments they washed out the screams. There were hundreds in the water, </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">drowning or burning or doing a little of both. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>Do you hear them shrieking, Stannis? Do you see them burning? This is your work as </i></text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>much as mine.</i> Somewhere in that seething mass of men south of the Blackwater, Stannis was </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">watching too, Tyrion knew. He’d never had his brother Robert’s thirst for battle. He would </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">command from the rear, from the reserve, much as Lord Tywin Lannister was wont to do. </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Like as not, he was sitting a warhorse right now, clad in bright armor, his crown upon his </text>
<text top="817" left="139" width="565" height="15" font="1">head. <i>A crown of red gold</i>, Varys says, <i>its points fashioned in the shapes of flames</i>. </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“My ships.” Joffrey’s voice cracked as he shouted up from the wallwalk, where he </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">huddled with his guards behind the ramparts. The golden circlet of kingship adorned his battle </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">helm. “My <i>Kingslander</i>’s burning, <i>Queen Cersei</i>, <i>Loyal Man</i>. Look, that’s <i>Seaflower</i>, there.” </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">He pointed with his new sword, out to where the green flames were licking at <i>Seaflower</i>’s </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">golden hull and creeping up her oars. Her captain had turned her upriver, but not quickly </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="202" height="15" font="1">enough to evade the wildfire. </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">She was doomed, Tyrion knew. <i>There was no other way. If we had not come forth to </i></text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>meet them, Stannis would have sensed the trap.</i> An arrow could be aimed, and a spear, even </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the stone from a catapult, but wildfire had a will of its own. Once loosed, it was beyond the </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">control of mere men. “It could not be helped,” he told his nephew. “Our fleet was doomed in </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">any case.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Even from atop the merlon—he had been too short to see over the ramparts, so he’d had </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them boost him up—the flames and smoke and chaos of battle made it impossible for Tyrion </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to see what was happening downriver under the castle, but he had seen it a thousand times in </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">his mind’s eye. Bronn would have whipped the oxen into motion the moment Stannis’s </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flagship passed under the Red Keep; the chain was ponderous heavy, and the great winches </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">turned but slowly, creaking and rumbling. The whole of the usurper’s fleet would have passed </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">by the time the first glimmer of metal could be seen beneath the water. The links would </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">emerge dripping-wet, some glistening with mud, link by link by link, until the whole great </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">chain stretched taut. King Stannis had rowed his fleet up the Blackwater, but he would not </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="102" height="15" font="1">row out again. </text>
<text top="304" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Even so, some were getting away. A river’s current was a tricky thing, and the wildfire </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was not spreading as evenly as he had hoped. The main channel was all aflame, but a good </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">many of the Myrmen had made for the south bank and looked to escape unscathed, and at </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">least eight ships had landed under the city walls. <i>Landed or wrecked, but it comes to the same </i></text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>thing, they’ve put men ashore.</i> Worse, a good part of the south wing of the enemy’s first two </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">battle lines had been well upstream of the inferno when the hulks went up. Stannis would be </text>
<text top="421" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">left with thirty or forty galleys, at a guess; more than enough to bring his whole host across, </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="258" height="15" font="1">once they had regained their courage. </text>
<text top="466" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">That might take a bit of time; even the bravest would be dismayed after watching a </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">thousand or so of his fellows consumed by wildfire. Hallyne said that sometimes the </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="474" height="15" font="1">substance burned so hot that flesh melted like tallow. Yet even so . . . </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had no illusions where his own men were concerned. <i>If the battle looks to be </i></text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>going sour they’ll break, and they’ll break bad</i>, Jacelyn Bywater had warned him, so the only </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">way to win was to make certain the battle stayed sweet, start to finish. </text>
<text top="594" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He could see dark shapes moving through the charred ruins of the riverfront wharfs. <i>Time </i></text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>for another sortie</i>, he thought. Men were never so vulnerable as when they first staggered </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">ashore. He must not give the foe time to form up on the north bank. </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">He scrambled down off the merlon. “Tell Lord Jacelyn we’ve got the enemy on the </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">riverfront,” he said to one of the runners Bywater had assigned him. To another he said, </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Bring my compliments to Ser Arneld and ask him to swing the Whores thirty degrees west.” </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="522" height="15" font="1">The angle would allow them to throw farther, if not as far out into the water. </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Mother promised I could have the Whores,” Joffrey said. Tyrion was annoyed to see </text>
<text top="761" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that the king had lifted the visor of his helm again. Doubtless the boy was cooking inside all </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that heavy steel . . . but the last thing he needed was some stray arrow punching through his </text>
<text top="800" left="139" width="101" height="15" font="1">nephew’s eye. </text>
<text top="825" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He clanged the visor shut. “Keep that closed, Your Grace; your sweet person is precious </text>
<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to us all.” <i>And you don’t want to spoil that pretty face, either.</i> “The Whores are yours.” It was </text>
<text top="864" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as good a time as any; flinging more firepots down onto burning ships seemed pointless. Joff </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had the Antler Men trussed up naked in the square below, antlers nailed to their heads. When </text>
<text top="903" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">they’d been brought before the Iron Throne for justice, he had promised to send them to </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis. A man was not as heavy as a boulder or a cask of burning pitch, and could be thrown </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a deal farther. Some of the gold cloaks had been wagering on whether the traitors would fly </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">all the way across the Blackwater. “Be quick about it, Your Grace,” he told Joffrey. “We’ll </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">want the trebuchets throwing stones again soon enough. Even wildfire does not burn forever.” </text>
<text top="1006" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Joffrey hurried off happy, escorted by Ser Meryn, but Tyrion caught Ser Osmund by the </text>
<text top="1025" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrist before he could follow. “Whatever happens, keep him safe and <i>keep him there</i>, is that </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">understood?” </text>
<text top="1070" left="171" width="344" height="15" font="1">“As you command.” Ser Osmund smiled amiably. </text>

<page number="447" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion had warned Trant and Kettleblack what would happen to them should any harm </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">come to the king. And Joffrey had a dozen veteran gold cloaks waiting at the foot of the steps. </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>I’m protecting your wretched bastard as well as I can, Cersei</i>, he thought bitterly. <i>See you do </i></text>
<text top="163" left="139" width="152" height="15" font="5"><i>the same for Alayaya.</i> </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No sooner was Joff off than a runner came panting up the steps. “My lord, hurry!” He </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">threw himself to one knee. “They’ve landed men on the tourney grounds, hundreds! They’re </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="266" height="15" font="1">bringing a ram up to the King’s Gate.” </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Tyrion cursed and made for the steps with a rolling waddle. Podrick Payne waited below </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with their horses. They galloped off down River Row, Pod and Ser Mandon Moore coming </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hard behind him. The shuttered houses were steeped in green shadow, but there was no traffic </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to get in their way; Tyrion had commanded that the street be kept clear, so the defenders </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could move quickly from one gate to the next. Even so, by the time they reached the King’s </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Gate, he could hear a booming crash of wood on wood that told him the battering ram had </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">been brought into play. The groaning of the great hinges sounded like the moans of a dying </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">giant. The gatehouse square was littered with the wounded, but he saw lines of horses as well, </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not all of them hurt, and sellswords and gold cloaks enough to form a strong column. “Form </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">up,” he shouted as he leapt to the ground. The gate moved under the impact of another blow. </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">“Who commands here? You’re going out.” </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No.” A shadow detached itself from the shadow of the wall, to become a tall man in </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dark grey armor. Sandor Clegane wrenched off his helm with both hands and let it fall to the </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ground. The steel was scorched and dented, the left ear of the snarling hound sheared off. A </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">gash above one eye had sent a wash of blood down across the Hound’s old burn scars, </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="153" height="15" font="1">masking half his face. </text>
<text top="575" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” Tyrion faced him. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="383" height="15" font="1">Clegane’s breath came ragged. “Bugger that. And you.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A sellsword stepped up beside him. “We been out. Three times. Half our men are killed </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">or hurt. Wildfire bursting all around us, horses screaming like men and men like horses—” </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Did you think we hired you to fight in a tourney? Shall I bring you a nice iced milk and </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="513" height="15" font="1">a bowl of raspberries? No? Then get on your fucking horse. You too, dog.” </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The blood on Clegane’s face glistened red, but his eyes showed white. He drew his </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">longsword. </text>
<text top="759" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He is afraid</i>, Tyrion realized, shocked. <i>The Hound is frightened.</i> He tried to explain their </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="604" height="15" font="1">need. “They’ve taken a ram to the gate, you can hear them, we need to disperse them—” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Open the gates. When they rush inside, surround them and kill them.” The Hound thrust </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the point of his longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel, swaying. “I’ve lost </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="435" height="15" font="1">half my men. Horse as well. I’m not taking more into that fire.” </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion’s side, immaculate in his enameled white plate. </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="248" height="15" font="1">“The King’s Hand commands you.” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Bugger the King’s Hand.” Where the Hound’s face was not sticky with blood, it was </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pale as milk. “Someone bring me a drink.” A gold cloak officer handed him a cup. Clegane </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="618" height="15" font="1">took a swallow, spit it out, flung the cup away. “Water? Fuck your water. Bring me wine.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He is dead on his feet.</i> Tyrion could see it now. <i>The wound, the fire . . . he’s done, I need </i></text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>to find someone else, but who? Ser Mandon?</i> He looked at the men and knew it would not do. </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Clegane’s fear had shaken them. Without a leader, they would refuse as well, and Ser Mandon </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="528" height="15" font="1">. . . a dangerous man, Jaime said, yes, but not a man other men would follow. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">In the distance Tyrion heard another great crash. Above the walls, the darkening sky was </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="518" height="15" font="1">awash with sheets of green and orange light. How long could the gate hold? </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>This is madness</i>, he thought, <i>but sooner madness than defeat. Defeat is death and shame.</i> </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="219" height="15" font="1">“Very well, I’ll lead the sortie.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">If he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor, he was wrong. Clegane only </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="116" height="15" font="1">laughed. “<i>You?</i>” </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion could see the disbelief on their faces. “Me. Ser Mandon, you’ll bear the king’s </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">banner. Pod, my helm.” The boy ran to obey. The Hound leaned on that notched and blood-</text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">streaked sword and looked at him with those wide white eyes. Ser Mandon helped Tyrion </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">mount up again. “<i>Form up!</i>” he shouted. </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His big red stallion wore crinet and chamfron. Crimson silk draped his hindquarters, over </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a coat of mail. The high saddle was gilded. Podrick Payne handed up helm and shield, heavy </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">oak emblazoned with a golden hand on red, surrounded by small golden lions. He walked his </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">horse in a circle, looking at the little force of men. Only a handful had responded to his </text>

<text top="438" left="139" width="574" height="15" font="1">Clegane. “They say I’m half a man,” he said. “What does that make the lot of you?” </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">That shamed them well enough. A knight mounted, helmetless, and rode to join the </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">others. A pair of sellswords followed. Then more. The King’s Gate shuddered again. In a few </text>

<text top="725" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The torches shimmered brightly against the hammered metal of the wall sconces, filling </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Queen’s Ballroom with silvery light. Yet there was still darkness in that hall. Sansa could </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">see it in the pale eyes of Ser Ilyn Payne, who stood by the back door still as stone, taking </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">neither food nor wine. She could hear it in Lord Gyles’s racking cough, and the whispered </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">voice of Osney Kettleblack when he slipped in to bring Cersei the tidings. </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Sansa was finishing her broth when he came the first time, entering through the back. She </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">glimpsed him talking to his brother Osfryd. Then he climbed the dais and knelt beside the </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">high seat, smelling of horse, four long thin scratches on his cheek crusted with scabs, his hair </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">falling down past his collar and into his eyes. For all his whispering, Sansa could not help but </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hear. “The fleets are locked in battle. Some archers got ashore, but the Hound’s cut them to </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pieces, Y’Grace. Your brother’s raising his chain, I heard the signal. Some drunkards down to </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="110" height="15" font="1">“And my son?” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The king went to Baelor’s to get the High Septon’s blessing. Now he’s walking the </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei beckoned to her page for another cup of wine, a golden vintage from the Arbor, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fruity and rich. The queen was drinking heavily, but the wine only seemed to make her more </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">beautiful; her cheeks were flushed, and her eyes had a bright, feverish heat to them as she </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="404" height="15" font="1">looked down over the hall. <i>Eyes of wildfire</i>, Sansa thought. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Musicians played. Jugglers juggled. Moon Boy lurched about the hall on stilts making </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mock of everyone, while Ser Dontos chased serving girls on his broomstick horse. The guests </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">laughed, but it was a joyless laughter, the sort of laughter that can turn into sobbing in half a </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heartbeat. <i>Their bodies are here, but their thoughts are on the city walls, and their hearts as </i></text>
<text top="266" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="5"><i>well.</i> </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After the broth came a salad of apples, nuts, and raisins. At any other time, it might have </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">made a tasty dish, but tonight all the food was flavored with fear. Sansa was not the only one </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in the hall without an appetite. Lord Gyles was coughing more than he was eating, Lollys </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Stokeworth sat hunched and shivering, and the young bride of one of Ser Lancel’s knights </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">began to weep uncontrollably. The queen commanded Maester Frenken to put her to bed with </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a cup of dreamwine. “Tears,” she said scornfully to Sansa as the woman was led from the </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">hall. “The woman’s weapon, my lady mother used to call them. The man’s weapon is a </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="398" height="15" font="1">sword. And that tells us all you need to know, doesn’t it?” </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Men must be very brave, though,” said Sansa. “To ride out and face swords and axes, </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="218" height="15" font="1">everyone trying to kill you . . .” </text>
<text top="497" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Jaime told me once that he only feels truly alive in battle and in bed.” She lifted her cup </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and took a long swallow. Her salad was untouched. “I would sooner face any number of </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swords than sit helpless like this, pretending to enjoy the company of this flock of frightened </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">hens.” </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“You asked them here, Your Grace.” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Certain things are expected of a queen. They will be expected of you should you ever </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wed Joffrey. Best learn.” The queen studied the wives, daughters, and mothers who filled the </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">benches. “Of themselves the hens are nothing, but their cocks are important for one reason or </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">another, and some may survive this battle. So it behooves me to give their women my </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">protection. If my wretched dwarf of a brother should somehow manage to prevail, they will </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">return to their husbands and fathers full of tales about how brave I was, how my courage </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="617" height="15" font="1">inspired them and lifted their spirits, how I never doubted our victory even for a moment.” </text>
<text top="747" left="171" width="215" height="15" font="1">“And if the castle should fall?” </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Cersei did not wait for a denial. “If I’m not betrayed by </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">my own guards, I may be able to hold here for a time. Then I can go to the walls and offer to </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">yield to Lord Stannis in person. That will spare us the worst. But if Maegor’s Holdfast should </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fall before Stannis can come up, why then, most of my guests are in for a bit of rape, I’d say. </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">And you should never rule out mutilation, torture, and murder at times like these.” </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="467" height="15" font="1">Sansa was horrified. “These are women, unarmed, and gently born.” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Their birth protects them,” Cersei admitted, “though not as much as you’d think. Each </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one’s worth a good ransom, but after the madness of battle, soldiers often seem to want flesh </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">more than coin. Even so, a golden shield is better than none. Out in the streets, the women </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">won’t be treated near as tenderly. Nor will our servants. Pretty things like that serving wench </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of Lady Tanda’s could be in for a lively night, but don’t imagine the old and the infirm and </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the ugly will be spared. Enough drink will make blind washerwomen and reeking pig girls </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">seem as comely as you, sweetling.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“<i>Try</i> not to sound so like a mouse, Sansa. You’re a woman now, remember? And </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">betrothed to my firstborn.” The queen sipped at her wine. “Were it anyone else outside the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gates, I might hope to beguile him. But this is Stannis Baratheon. I’d have a better chance of </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seducing his horse.” She noticed the look on Sansa’s face, and laughed. “Have I shocked you, </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">my lady?” She leaned close. “You little fool. Tears are not a woman’s only weapon. You’ve </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">got another one between your legs, and you’d best learn to use it. You’ll find men use their </text>

<text top="246" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Sansa was spared the need to reply when two Kettleblacks reentered the hall. Ser </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Osmund and his brothers had become great favorites about the castle; they were always ready </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with a smile and a jest, and got on with grooms and huntsmen as well as they did with knights </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and squires. With the serving wenches they got on best of all, it was gossiped. Of late Ser </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Osmund had taken Sandor Clegane’s place by Joffrey’s side, and Sansa had heard the women </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at the washing well saying he was as strong as the Hound, only younger and faster. If that was </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">so, she wondered why she had never once heard of these Kettleblacks before Ser Osmund was </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="179" height="15" font="1">named to the Kingsguard. </text>
<text top="407" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Osney was all smiles as he knelt beside the queen. “The hulks have gone up, Y’Grace. </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">The whole Blackwater’s awash with wildfire. A hundred ships burning, maybe more.” </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="110" height="15" font="1">“And my son?” </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He’s at the Mud Gate with the Hand and the Kingsguard, Y’Grace. He spoke to the </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">archers on the hoardings before, and gave them a few tips on handling a crossbow, he did. All </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="209" height="15" font="1">agree, he’s a right brave boy.” </text>
<text top="541" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He’d best remain a right <i>live</i> boy.” Cersei turned to his brother Osfryd, who was taller, </text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">sterner, and wore a drooping black mustache. “Yes?” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Osfryd had donned a steel half-helm over his long black hair, and the look on his face </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was grim, “Y’Grace,” he said quietly, “the boys caught a groom and two maidservants trying </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="373" height="15" font="1">to sneak out a postern with three of the king’s horses.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The night’s first traitors,” the queen said, “but not the last, I fear. Have Ser Ilyn see to </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them, and put their heads on pikes outside the stables as a warning.” As they left, she turned </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to Sansa. “Another lesson you should learn, if you hope to sit beside my son. Be gentle on a </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">night like this and you’ll have treasons popping up all about you like mushrooms after a hard </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rain. The only way to keep your people loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="107" height="15" font="1">do the enemy.” </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I will remember, Your Grace,” said Sansa, though she had always heard that love was a </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">surer route to the people’s loyalty than fear. <i>If I am ever a queen, I’ll make them love me.</i> </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Crabclaw pies followed the salad. Then came mutton roasted with leeks and carrots, </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">served in trenchers of hollowed bread. Lollys ate too fast, got sick, and retched all over herself </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and her sister. Lord Gyles coughed, drank, coughed, drank, and passed out. The queen gazed </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down in disgust to where he sprawled with his face in his trencher and his hand in a puddle of </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wine. “The gods must have been mad to waste manhood on the likes of him, and I must have </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">been mad to demand his release.” </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Osfryd Kettleblack returned, crimson cloak swirling. “There’s folks gathering in the </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="634" height="15" font="1">square, Y’Grace, asking to take refuge in the castle. Not a mob, rich merchants and the like.” </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Command them to return to their homes,” the queen said. “If they won’t go, have our </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="568" height="15" font="1">crossbowmen kill a few. No sorties; I won’t have the gates opened for any reason.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="324" height="15" font="1">“As you command.” He bowed and moved off. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The queen’s face was hard and angry. “Would that I could take a sword to their necks </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">myself.” Her voice was starting to slur. “When we were little, Jaime and I were so much alike </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that even our lord father could not tell us apart. Sometimes as a lark we would dress in each </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">other’s clothes and spend a whole day each as the other. Yet even so, when Jaime was given </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his first sword, there was none for me. ‘What do I get?’ I remember asking. We were so much </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">alike, I could never understand why they treated us so <i>differently</i>. Jaime learned to fight with </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sword and lance and mace, while I was taught to smile and sing and please. He was heir to </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Casterly Rock, while I was to be sold to some stranger like a horse, to be ridden whenever my </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">new owner liked, beaten whenever he liked, and cast aside in time for a younger filly. Jaime’s </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">lot was to be glory and power, while mine was birth and moonblood.” </text>
<text top="304" left="171" width="424" height="15" font="1">“But you were queen of all the Seven Kingdoms,” Sansa said. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="428" height="15" font="1">“When it comes to swords, a queen is only a woman after all.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cersei’s wine cup was empty. The page moved to fill it again, but she turned it over and </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">shook her head. “No more. I must keep a clear head.” </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The last course was goat cheese served with baked apples. The scent of cinnamon filled </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the hall as Osney Kettleblack slipped in to kneel once more between them. “Y’Grace,” he </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">murmured. “Stannis has landed men on the tourney grounds, and there’s more coming across. </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The Mud Gate’s under attack, and they’ve brought a ram to the King’s Gate. The Imp’s gone </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="156" height="15" font="1">out to drive them off.” </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="569" height="15" font="1">“That will fill them with fear,” the queen said dryly. “He hasn’t taken Joff, I hope.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No, Y’Grace, the king’s with my brother at the Whores, flinging Antler Men into the </text>

<text top="572" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“With the Mud Gate under assault? Folly. Tell Ser Osmund I want him out of there at </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">once, it’s too dangerous. Fetch him back to the castle.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="126" height="15" font="1">“The Imp said—” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s what <i>I</i> said that ought concern you.” Cersei’s eyes narrowed. “Your brother will do </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">as he’s told, or I’ll see to it that he leads the next sortie himself, and you’ll go with him.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After the meal had been cleared away, many of the guests asked leave to go to the sept. </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Cersei graciously granted their request. Lady Tanda and her daughters were among those who </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fled. For those who remained, a singer was brought forth to fill the hall with the sweet music </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the high harp. He sang of Jonquil and Florian, of Prince Aemon the Dragonknight and his </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">love for his brother’s queen, of Nymeria’s ten thousand ships. They were beautiful songs, but </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="643" height="15" font="1">terribly sad. Several of the women began to weep, and Sansa felt her own eyes growing moist. </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Very good, dear.” The queen leaned close. “You want to practice those tears. You’ll </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="202" height="15" font="1">need them for King Stannis.” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="275" height="15" font="1">Sansa shifted nervously. “Your Grace?” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh, spare me your hollow courtesies. Matters must have reached a desperate strait out </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">there if they need a dwarf to lead them, so you might as well take off your mask. I know all </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="300" height="15" font="1">about your little treasons in the godswood.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The godswood?” <i>Don’t look at Ser Dontos, don’t, don’t</i>, Sansa told herself. <i>She doesn’t </i></text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>know, no one knows, Dontos promised me, my Florian would never fail me.</i> “I’ve done no </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="304" height="15" font="1">treasons. I only visit the godswood to pray.” </text>
<text top="1007" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“For Stannis. Or your brother, it’s all the same. Why else seek your father’s gods? </text>
<text top="1026" left="139" width="497" height="15" font="1">You’re praying for our defeat. What would you call that, if not treason?” </text>
<text top="1051" left="171" width="298" height="15" font="1">“I pray for Joffrey,” she insisted nervously. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Why, because he treats you so sweetly?” The queen took a flagon of sweet plum wine </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">from a passing serving girl and filled Sansa’s cup. “Drink,” she commanded coldly. “Perhaps </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">it will give you the courage to deal with truth for a change.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa lifted the cup to her lips and took a sip. The wine was cloyingly sweet, but very </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">strong. </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You can do better than that,” Cersei said. “Drain the cup, Sansa. Your queen commands </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">you.” It almost gagged her, but Sansa emptied the cup, gulping down the thick sweet wine </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="208" height="15" font="1">until her head was swimming. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="158" height="15" font="1">“More?” Cersei asked. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="96" height="15" font="1">“No. Please.” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The queen looked displeased. “When you asked about Ser Ilyn earlier, I lied to you. </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="603" height="15" font="1">Would you like to hear the truth, Sansa? Would you like to know why he’s really here?” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She did not dare answer, but it did not matter. The queen raised a hand and beckoned, </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">never waiting for a reply. Sansa had not even seen Ser Ilyn return to the hall, but suddenly </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">there he was, striding from the shadows behind the dais as silent as a cat. He carried Ice </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">unsheathed. Her father had always cleaned the blade in the godswood after he took a man’s </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">head, Sansa recalled, but Ser Ilyn was not so fastidious. There was blood drying on the </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rippling steel, the red already fading to brown. “Tell Lady Sansa why I keep you by us,” said </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">Cersei. </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Ilyn opened his mouth and emitted a choking rattle. His pox-scarred face had no </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="81" height="15" font="1">expression. </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He’s here for us, he says,” the queen said. “Stannis may take the city and he may take </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="606" height="15" font="1">the throne, but I will not suffer him to judge me. I do not mean for him to have us alive.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="47" height="15" font="1">“<i>Us?</i>” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You heard me. So perhaps you had best pray again, Sansa, and for a different outcome. </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The Starks will have no joy from the fall of House Lannister, I promise you.” She reached out </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">and touched Sansa’s hair, brushing it lightly away from her neck. </text>

<text top="767" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The slot in his helm limited Tyrion’s vision to what was before him, but when he turned </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the </text>

<text top="831" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Wedge,” Tyrion commanded as his men streamed out of the sally port. They formed up </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in spearhead, with him at the point. Ser Mandon Moore took the place to his right, flames </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">shimmering against the white enamel of his armor, his dead eyes shining passionlessly </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through his helm. He rode a coal-black horse barded all in white, with the pure white shield of </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Kingsguard strapped to his arm. On the left, Tyrion was surprised to see Podrick Payne, a </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="461" height="15" font="1">sword in his hand. “You’re too young,” he said at once. “Go back.” </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="191" height="15" font="1">“I’m your squire, my lord.” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion could spare no time for argument. “With me, then. Stay close.” He kicked his </text>

<text top="1024" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They rode knee to knee, following the line of the looming walls. Joffrey’s standard </text>
<text top="1043" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">streamed crimson and gold from Ser Mandon’s staff, stag and lion dancing hoof to paw. They </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">went from a walk to a trot, wheeling wide around the base of the tower. Arrows darted from </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the city walls while stones spun and tumbled overhead, crashing down blindly onto earth and </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">water, steel and flesh. Ahead loomed the King’s Gate and a surging mob of soldiers wrestling </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with a huge ram, a shaft of black oak with an iron head. Archers off the ships surrounded </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them, loosing their shafts at whatever defenders showed themselves on the gatehouse walls. </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="351" height="15" font="1">“Lances,” Tyrion commanded. He sped to a canter. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The ground was sodden and slippery, equal parts mud and blood. His stallion stumbled </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">over a corpse, his hooves sliding and churning the earth, and for an instant Tyrion feared his </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">charge would end with him tumbling from the saddle before he even reached the foe, but </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">somehow he and his horse both managed to keep their balance. Beneath the gate men were </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">turning, hurriedly trying to brace for the shock. Tyrion lifted his axe and shouted, “<i>King’s </i></text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Landing!</i>” Other voices took up the cry, and now the arrowhead flew, a long scream of steel </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="399" height="15" font="1">and silk, pounding hooves and sharp blades kissed by fire. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Mandon dropped the point of his lance at the last possible instant, and drove Joffrey’s </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">banner through the chest of a man in a studded jerkin, lifting him full off his feet before the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shaft snapped. Ahead of Tyrion was a knight whose surcoat showed a fox peering through a </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ring of flowers. <i>Florent</i> was his first thought, but <i>helmless</i> ran a close second. He smashed the </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">man in the face with all the weight of axe and arm and charging horse, taking off half his </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">head. The shock of impact numbed his shoulder. <i>Shagga would laugh at me</i>, he thought, </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="70" height="15" font="1">riding on. </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A spear thudded against his shield. Pod galloped beside him, slashing down at every foe </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">they passed. Dimly, he heard cheers from the men on the walls. The battering ram crashed </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">down into the mud, forgotten in an instant as its handlers fled or turned to fight. Tyrion rode </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">down an archer, opened a spearman from shoulder to armpit, glanced a blow off a swordfish-</text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crested helm. At the ram his big red reared but the black stallion leapt the obstacle smoothly </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and Ser Mandon flashed past him, death in snow-white silk. His sword sheared off limbs, </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cracked heads, broke shields asunder—though few enough of the enemy had made it across </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="193" height="15" font="1">the river with shields intact. </text>
<text top="652" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tyrion urged his mount over the ram. Their foes were fleeing. He moved his head right </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">to left and back again, but saw no sign of Podrick Payne. An arrow clattered against his </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">cheek, missing his eye-slit by an inch. His jolt of fear almost unhorsed him. <i>If I’m to sit here </i></text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="408" height="15" font="5"><i>like a stump, I had as well paint a target on my breastplate.</i> </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He spurred his horse back into motion, trotting over and around a scatter of corpses. </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Downriver, the Blackwater was jammed with the hulks of burning galleys. Patches of wildfire </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">still floated atop the water, sending fiery green plumes swirling twenty feet into the air. They </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had dispersed the men on the battering ram, but he could see fighting all along the riverfront. </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ser Balon Swann’s men, most like, or Lancel’s, trying to throw the enemy back into the water </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">as they swarmed ashore off the burning ships. “We’ll ride for the Mud Gate,” he commanded. </text>
<text top="858" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Mandon shouted, “<i>The Mud Gate!</i>” And they were off again. “<i>King’s Landing!</i>” his </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">men cried raggedly, and “<i>Halfman! Halfman!</i>” He wondered who had taught them that. </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Through the steel and padding of his helm, he heard anguished screams, the hungry crackle of </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">flame, the shuddering of warhorns, and the brazen blast of trumpets. Fire was everywhere. </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="547" height="15" font="5"><i>Gods be good, no wonder the Hound was frightened. It’s the flames he fears . . .</i> </text>
<text top="961" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A splintering crash rang across the Blackwater as a stone the size of a horse landed </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">square amidships on one of the galleys. <i>Ours or theirs?</i> Through the roiling smoke, he could </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">not tell. His wedge was gone; every man was his own battle now. <i>I should have turned back</i>, </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="151" height="15" font="1">he thought, riding on. </text>
</page>
<page number="454" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The axe was heavy in his fist. A handful still followed him, the rest dead or fled. He had </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to wrestle his stallion to keep his head to the east. The big destrier liked fire no more than </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="365" height="15" font="1">Sandor Clegane had, but the horse was easier to cow. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">Men were crawling from the river, men burned and bleeding, coughing up water, </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">staggering, most dying. He led his troop among them, delivering quicker cleaner deaths to </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">those strong enough to stand. The war shrank to the size of his eye-slit. Knights twice his size </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">fled from him, or stood and died. They seemed little things, and fearful. “<i>Lannister!</i>” he </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shouted, slaying. His arm was red to the elbow, glistening in the light off the river. When his </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">horse reared again, he shook his axe at the stars and heard them call out “<i>Halfman! Halfman!</i>” </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="125" height="15" font="1">Tyrion felt drunk. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>The battle fever.</i> He had never thought to experience it himself, though Jaime had told </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him of it often enough. How time seemed to blur and slow and even stop, how the past and </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the future vanished until there was nothing but the instant, how fear fled, and thought fled, </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and even your body. “You don’t feel your wounds then, or the ache in your back from the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weight of the armor, or the sweat running down into your eyes. You stop feeling, you stop </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thinking, you stop being <i>you</i>, there is only the fight, the foe, this man and then the next and </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the next and the next, and you know they are afraid and tired but you’re not, you’re alive, and </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">death is all around you but their swords move so slowly, you can dance through them </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">laughing.” <i>Battle fever. I am half a man and drunk with slaughter, let them kill me if they can!</i> </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They tried. Another spearman ran at him. Tyrion lopped off the head of his spear, then </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his hand, then his arm, trotting around him in a circle. An archer, bowless, thrust at him with </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">an arrow, holding it as if it were a knife. The destrier kicked at the man’s thigh to send him </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">sprawling, and Tyrion barked laughter. He rode past a banner planted in the mud, one of </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Stannis’s fiery hearts, and chopped the staff in two with a swing of his axe. A knight rose up </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">from nowhere to hack at his shield with a two-handed greatsword, again and again, until </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="584" height="15" font="1">someone thrust a dagger under his arm. One of Tyrion’s men, perhaps. He never saw. </text>
<text top="633" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I yield, ser,” a different knight called out, farther down the river. “Yield. Ser knight, I </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yield to you. My pledge, here, here.” The man lay in a puddle of black water, offering up a </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lobstered gauntlet in token of submission. Tyrion had to lean down to take it from him. As he </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">did, a pot of wildfire burst overhead, spraying green flame. In the sudden stab of light he saw </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that the puddle was not black but red. The gauntlet still had the knight’s hand in it. He flung it </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="508" height="15" font="1">back. “Yield,” the man sobbed hopelessly, helplessly. Tyrion reeled away. </text>
<text top="755" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A man-at-arms grabbed the bridle of his horse and thrust at Tyrion’s face with a dagger. </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">He knocked the blade aside and buried the axe in the nape of the man’s neck. As he was </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wresting it free, a blaze of white appeared at the edge of his vision. Tyrion turned, thinking to </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">find Ser Mandon Moore beside him again, but this was a different white knight. Ser Balon </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Swann wore the same armor, but his horse trappings bore the battling black-and-white swans </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of his House. <i>He’s more a spotted knight than a white one</i>, Tyrion thought inanely. Every bit </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of Ser Balon was spattered with gore and smudged by smoke. He raised his mace to point </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="470" height="15" font="1">downriver. Bits of brain and bone clung to its head. “My lord, look.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Tyrion swung his horse about to peer down the Blackwater. The current still flowed </text>

<text top="956" left="139" width="384" height="15" font="1">orange and garish green. “What?” he said. Then he saw. </text>
<text top="981" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Steel-clad men-at-arms were clambering off a broken galley that had smashed into a pier. </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>So many, where are they coming from?</i> Squinting into the smoke and glare, Tyrion followed </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them back out into the river. Twenty galleys were jammed together out there, maybe more, it </text>
<text top="1039" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was hard to count. Their oars were crossed, their hulls locked together with grappling lines, </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">they were impaled on each other’s rams, tangled in webs of fallen rigging. One great hulk </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">floated hull-up between two smaller ships. Wrecks, but packed so closely that it was possible </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="431" height="15" font="1">to leap from one deck to the other and so cross the Blackwater. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hundreds of Stannis Baratheon’s boldest were doing just that. Tyrion saw one great fool </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of a knight trying to ride across, urging a terrified horse over gunwales and oars, across tilting </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">decks slick with blood and crackling with green fire. <i>We made them a bloody bridge</i>, he </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thought in dismay. Parts of the bridge were sinking and other parts were afire and the whole </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thing was creaking and shifting and like to burst asunder at any moment, but that did not seem </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="623" height="15" font="1">to stop them. “Those are brave men,” he told Ser Balon in admiration. “Let’s go kill them.” </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He led them through the guttering fires and the soot and ash of the riverfront, pounding </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">down a long stone quay with his own men and Ser Balon’s behind him. Ser Mandon fell in </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with them, his shield a ragged ruin. Smoke and cinders swirled through the air, and the foe </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">broke before their charge, throwing themselves back into the water, knocking over other men </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">as they fought to climb up. The foot of the bridge was a half-sunken enemy galley with </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Dragonsbane</i> painted on her prow, her bottom ripped out by one of the sunken hulks Tyrion </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">had placed between the quays. A spearman wearing the red crab badge of House Celtigar </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">drove the point of his weapon up through the chest of Balon Swann’s horse before he could </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dismount, spilling the knight from the saddle. Tyrion hacked at the man’s head as he flashed </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by, and by then it was too late to rein up. His stallion leapt from the end of the quay and over </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a splintered gunwale, landing with a splash and a scream in ankle-deep water. Tyrion’s axe </text>
<text top="485" left="139" width="616" height="15" font="1">went spinning, followed by Tyrion himself, and the deck rose up to give him a wet smack. </text>
<text top="510" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Madness followed. His horse had broken a leg and was screaming horribly. Somehow he </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">managed to draw his dagger, and slit the poor creature’s throat. The blood gushed out in a </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">scarlet fountain, drenching his arms and chest. He found his feet again and lurched to the rail, </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and then he was fighting, staggering and splashing across crooked decks awash with water. </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Men came at him. Some he killed, some he wounded, and some went away, but always there </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">were more. He lost his knife and gained a broken spear, he could not have said how. He </text>
<text top="627" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">clutched it and stabbed, shrieking curses. Men ran from him and he ran after them, clambering </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">up over the rail to the next ship and then the next. His two white shadows were always with </text>
<text top="666" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">him; Balon Swann and Mandon Moore, beautiful in their pale plate. Surrounded by a circle of </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">Velaryon spearmen, they fought back to back; they made battle as graceful as a dance. </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">His own killing was a clumsy thing. He stabbed one man in the kidney when his back </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was turned, and grabbed another by the leg and upended him into the river. Arrows hissed </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">past his head and clattered off his armor; one lodged between shoulder and breastplate, but he </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">never felt it. A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck, body bursting like a </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">melon dropped from a tower. His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion’s helm. Stones </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">began to plummet down, crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp, until the whole </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="542" height="15" font="1">bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot, knocking him sideways. </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Suddenly the river was pouring into his helm. He ripped it off and crawled along the </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">listing deck until the water was only neck-deep. A groaning filled the air, like the death cries </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of some enormous beast, <i>The ship</i>, he had time to think, <i>the ship’s about to tear loose.</i> The </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">broken galleys were ripping apart, the bridge breaking apart. No sooner had he come to that </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">realization than he heard a sudden <i>crack</i>, loud as thunder, the deck lurched beneath him, and </text>
<text top="950" left="139" width="229" height="15" font="1">he slid back down into the water. </text>
<text top="975" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The list was so steep he had to climb back up, hauling himself along a snapped line inch </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">by bloody inch. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the hulk they’d been tangled with drifting </text>
<text top="1014" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">downstream with the current, spinning slowly as men leapt over her side. Some wore </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Stannis’s flaming heart, some Joffrey’s stag-and-lion, some other badges, but it seemed to </text>
<text top="1053" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">make no matter. Fires were burning upstream and down. On one side of him was a raging </text>
<text top="1073" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">battle, a great confusion of bright banners waving above a sea of struggling men, shield walls </text>
</page>
<page number="456" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">forming and breaking, mounted knights cutting through the press, dust and mud and blood </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and smoke. On the other side, the Red Keep loomed high on its hill, spitting fire. They were </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">on the wrong sides, though. For a moment Tyrion thought he was going mad, that Stannis and </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the castle had traded places. <i>How could Stannis cross to the north bank?</i> Belatedly he realized </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that the deck was turning, and somehow he had gotten spun about, so castle and battle had </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">changed sides. <i>Battle, what battle, if Stannis hasn’t crossed who is he fighting?</i> Tyrion was </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">too tired to make sense of it. His shoulder ached horribly, and when he reached up to rub it he </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">saw the arrow, and remembered. <i>I have to get off this ship.</i> Downstream was nothing but a </text>
<text top="260" left="139" width="552" height="15" font="1">wall of fire, and if the wreck broke loose the current would take him right into it. </text>
<text top="285" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Someone was calling his name faintly through the din of battle. Tyrion tried to shout </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">back. “Here! Here, I’m here, help me!” His voice sounded so thin he could scarcely hear </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">himself. He pulled himself up the slanting deck, and grabbed for the rail. The hull slammed </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">into the next galley over and rebounded so violently he was almost knocked into the water. </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="456" height="15" font="1">Where had all his strength gone? It was all he could do to hang on. </text>
<text top="388" left="171" width="371" height="15" font="1">“<i>MY LORD! TAKE MY HAND! MY LORD TYRION!</i>” </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">There on the deck of the next ship, across a widening gulf of black water, stood Ser </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Mandon Moore, a hand extended. Yellow and green fire shone against the white of his armor, </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and his lobstered gauntlet was sticky with blood, but Tyrion reached for it all the same, </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wishing his arms were longer. It was only at the very last, as their fingers brushed across the </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="615" height="15" font="1">gap, that something niggled at him . . . Ser Mandon was holding out his <i>left</i> hand, why . . . </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Was that why he reeled backward, or did he see the sword after all? He would never </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">know. The point slashed just beneath his eyes, and he felt its cold hard touch and then a blaze </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of pain. His head spun around as if he’d been slapped. The shock of the cold water was a </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">second slap more jolting than the first. He flailed for something to grab on to, knowing that </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">once he went down he was not like to come back up. Somehow his hand found the splintered </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">end of a broken oar. Clutching it tight as a desperate lover, he shinnied up foot by foot. His </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">eyes were full of water, his mouth was full of blood, and his head throbbed horribly. <i>Gods </i></text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>give me strength to reach the deck . . .</i> There was nothing else, only the oar, the water, the </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">deck. </text>
<text top="697" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Finally he rolled over the side and lay breathless and exhausted, flat on his back. Balls of </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">green and orange flame crackled overhead, leaving streaks between the stars. He had a </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moment to think how pretty it was before Ser Mandon blocked out the view. The knight was a </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">white steel shadow, his eyes shining darkly behind his helm. Tyrion had no more strength </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">than a rag doll. Ser Mandon put the point of his sword to the hollow of his throat and curled </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">both hands around the hilt. </text>
<text top="819" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">And suddenly he lurched to the left, staggering into the rail. Wood split, and Ser Mandon </text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Moore vanished with a shout and a splash. An instant later, the hulls came slamming together </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">again, so hard the deck seemed to jump. Then someone was kneeling over him. “Jaime?” he </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">croaked, almost choking on the blood that filled his mouth. Who else would save him, if not </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">his brother? </text>
<text top="923" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Be still, my lord, you’re hurt bad.” <i>A boy’s voice, that makes no sense</i>, thought Tyrion. </text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">It sounded almost like Pod. </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Your brother’s likely dead.” Ser Lancel’s surcoat was soaked with the blood seeping out </text>

<text top="188" left="139" width="432" height="15" font="1">“What did Osney tell her? Is the king hurt, has the city fallen?” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="583" height="15" font="1">“<i>Tell us</i>,” someone else shouted. One woman asked about her father, another her son. </text>
<text top="238" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Sansa raised her hands for quiet. “Joffrey’s come back to the castle. He’s not hurt. </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">They’re still fighting, that’s all I know, they’re fighting bravely. The queen will be back </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">soon.” The last was a lie, but she had to soothe them. She noticed the fools standing under the </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="253" height="15" font="1">galley. “Moon Boy, make us laugh.” </text>
<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Moon Boy did a cartwheel, and vaulted on top of a table. He grabbed up four wine cups </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and began to juggle them. Every so often one of them would come down and smash him in </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the head. A few nervous laughs echoed through the hall. Sansa went to Ser Lancel and knelt </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beside him. His wound was bleeding afresh where the queen had struck him. “Madness,” he </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="334" height="15" font="1">gasped. “Gods, the Imp was right, was right . . .” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Help him,” Sansa commanded two of the serving men. One just looked at her and ran, </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">flagon and all. Other servants were leaving the hall as well, but she could not help that. </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Together, Sansa and the serving man got the wounded knight back on his feet. “Take him to </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Maester Frenken.” Lancel was one of <i>them</i>, yet somehow she still could not bring herself to </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wish him dead. <i>I am soft and weak and stupid, just as Joffrey says. I should be killing him, not </i></text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="89" height="15" font="5"><i>helping him.</i> </text>
<text top="547" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The torches had begun to burn low, and one or two had flickered out. No one troubled to </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">replace them. Cersei did not return. Ser Dontos climbed the dais while all eyes were on the </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">other fool. “Go back to your bedchamber, sweet Jonquil,” he whispered. “Lock yourself in, </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">you’ll be safer there. I’ll come for you when the battle’s done.” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Someone will come for me</i>, Sansa thought, <i>but will it be you, or will it be Ser Ilyn?</i> For a </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mad moment she thought of begging Dontos to defend her. He had been a knight too, trained </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">with the sword and sworn to defend the weak. <i>No. He has not the courage, or the skill. I </i></text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="5"><i>would only be killing him as well.</i> </text>
<text top="714" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">It took all the strength she had in her to walk slowly from the Queen’s Ballroom when </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she wanted so badly to run. When she reached the steps, she <i>did</i> run, up and around until she </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was breathless and dizzy. One of the guards knocked into her on the stair. A jeweled wine cup </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and a pair of silver candlesticks spilled out of the crimson cloak he’d wrapped them in and </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">went clattering down the steps. He hurried after them, paying Sansa no mind once he decided </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="1">she was not going to try and take his loot. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her bedchamber was black as pitch. Sansa barred the door and fumbled through the dark </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">to the window. When she ripped back the drapes, her breath caught in her throat. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The southern sky was aswirl with glowing, shifting colors, the reflections of the great </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fires that burned below. Baleful green tides moved against the bellies of the clouds, and pools </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of orange light spread out across the heavens. The reds and yellows of common flame warred </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">against the emeralds and jades of wildfire, each color flaring and then fading, birthing armies </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of short-lived shadows to die again an instant later. Green dawns gave way to orange dusks in </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">half a heartbeat. The air itself smelled <i>burnt</i>, the way a soup kettle sometimes smelled if it </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">was left on the fire too long and all the soup boiled away. Embers drifted through the night air </text>
<text top="1017" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">like swarms of fireflies. </text>
<text top="1042" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Sansa backed away from the window, retreating toward the safety of her bed. <i>I’ll go to </i></text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>sleep</i>, she told herself, <i>and when I wake it will be a new day, and the sky will be blue again. </i></text>

<page number="459" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>The fighting will be done and someone will tell me whether I’m to live or die.</i> “Lady,” she </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="570" height="15" font="1">whimpered softly, wondering if she would meet her wolf again when she was dead. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Then something stirred behind her, and a hand reached out of the dark and grabbed her </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">wrist. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Sansa opened her mouth to scream, but another hand clamped down over her face, </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">smothering her. His fingers were rough and callused, and sticky with blood. “Little bird. I </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="348" height="15" font="1">knew you’d come.” The voice was a drunken rasp. </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Outside, a swirling lance of jade light spit at the stars, filling the room with green glare. </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She saw him for a moment, all black and green, the blood on his face dark as tar, his eyes </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">glowing like a dog’s in the sudden glare. Then the light faded and he was only a hulking </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="232" height="15" font="1">darkness in a stained white cloak. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you scream I’ll kill you. Believe that.” He took his hand from her mouth. Her breath </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was coming ragged. The Hound had a flagon of wine on her bedside table. He took a long </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="455" height="15" font="1">pull. “Don’t you want to ask who’s winning the battle, little bird?” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="309" height="15" font="1">“Who?” she said, too frightened to defy him. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="354" height="15" font="1">The Hound laughed. “I only know who’s lost. Me.” </text>
<text top="455" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>He is drunker than I’ve ever seen him. He was sleeping in my bed. What does he want </i></text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="5"><i>here?</i> “What have you lost?” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“All.” The burnt half of his face was a mask of dried blood. “Bloody dwarf. Should have </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">killed him. Years ago.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="156" height="15" font="1">“He’s dead, they say.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Dead? No. Bugger that. I don’t want him dead.” He cast the empty flagon aside. “I want </text>
<text top="589" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">him <i>burned</i>. If the gods are good, they’ll burn him, but I won’t be here to see. I’m going.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“Going?” She tried to wriggle free, but his grasp was iron. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="384" height="15" font="1">“The little bird repeats whatever she hears. <i>Going</i>, yes.” </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="153" height="15" font="1">“Where will you go?” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“Away from here. Away from the fires. Go out the Iron Gate, I suppose. North </text>
<text top="709" left="139" width="168" height="15" font="1">somewhere, anywhere.” </text>
<text top="734" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“You won’t get out,” Sansa said. “The queen’s closed up Maegor’s, and the city gates are </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="96" height="15" font="1">shut as well.” </text>
<text top="779" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Not to me. I have the white cloak. And I have <i>this</i>.” He patted the pommel of his sword. </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="1">“The man who tries to stop me is a dead man. Unless he’s on fire.” He laughed bitterly. </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="189" height="15" font="1">“Why did you come here?” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="407" height="15" font="1">“You promised me a song, little bird. Have you forgotten?” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She didn’t know what he meant. She couldn’t sing for him now, here, with the sky aswirl </text>
<text top="893" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with fire and men dying in their hundreds and their thousands. “I can’t,” she said. “Let me go, </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="138" height="15" font="1">you’re scaring me.” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">“Everything scares you. Look at me. <i>Look</i> at me.” </text>
<text top="963" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The blood masked the worst of his scars, but his eyes were white and wide and terrifying. </text>
<text top="982" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">The burnt corner of his mouth twitched and twitched again. Sansa could smell him; a stink of </text>
<text top="1002" left="139" width="570" height="15" font="1">sweat and sour wine and stale vomit, and over it all the reek of blood, blood, blood. </text>
<text top="1027" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I could keep you safe,” he rasped. “They’re all afraid of me. No one would hurt you </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">again, or I’d kill them.” He yanked her closer, and for a moment she thought he meant to kiss </text>
<text top="1066" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">her. He was too strong to fight. She closed her eyes, wanting it to be over, but nothing </text>

<page number="460" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">happened. “Still can’t bear to look, can you?” she heard him say. He gave her arm a hard </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrench, pulling her around and shoving her down onto the bed. “I’ll have that song. Florian </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and Jonquil, you said.” His dagger was out, poised at her throat. “Sing, little bird. Sing for </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">your little life.” </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her throat was dry and tight with fear, and every song she had ever known had fled from </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">her mind. <i>Please don’t kill me</i>, she wanted to scream, <i>please don’t.</i> She could feel him </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">twisting the point, pushing it into her throat, and she almost closed her eyes again, but then </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she remembered. It was not the song of Florian and Jonquil, but it was a song. Her voice </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="341" height="15" font="1">sounded small and thin and tremulous in her ears. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Gentle Mother, font of mercy, save our sons from war, we pray, stay the swords and stay </i></text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="269" height="15" font="5"><i>the arrows, let them know a better day. </i></text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>Gentle Mother, strength of women, help our daughters through this fray, soothe the </i></text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="349" height="15" font="5"><i>wrath and tame the fury, teach us all a kinder way.</i> </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She had forgotten the other verses. When her voice trailed off, she feared he might kill </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="1">her, but after a moment the Hound took the blade from her throat, never speaking. </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Some instinct made her lift her hand and cup his cheek with her fingers. The room was </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">too dark for her to see him, but she could feel the stickiness of the blood, and a wetness that </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">was not blood. “Little bird,” he said once more, his voice raw and harsh as steel on stone. </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Then he rose from the bed. Sansa heard cloth ripping, followed by the softer sound of </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="139" height="15" font="1">retreating footsteps. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she crawled out of bed, long moments later, she was alone. She found his cloak on </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the floor, twisted up tight, the white wool stained by blood and fire. The sky outside was </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">darker by then, with only a few pale green ghosts dancing against the stars. A chill wind was </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blowing, banging the shutters. Sansa was cold. She shook out the torn cloak and huddled </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="230" height="15" font="1">beneath it on the floor, shivering. </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">How long she stayed there she could not have said, but after a time she heard a bell </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ringing, far off across the city. The sound was a deep-throated bronze booming, coming faster </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with each knell. Sansa was wondering what it might mean when a second bell joined in, and a </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">third, their voices calling across the hills and hollows, the alleys and towers, to every corner </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="468" height="15" font="1">of King’s Landing. She threw off the cloak and went to her window. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The first faint hint of dawn was visible in the east, and the Red Keep’s own bells were </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ringing now, joining in the swelling river of sound that flowed from the seven crystal towers </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the Great Sept of Baelor. They had rung the bells when King Robert died, she remembered, </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but this was different, no slow dolorous death knell but a joyful thunder. She could hear men </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">shouting in the streets as well, and something that could only be cheers. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">It was Ser Dontos who brought her the word. He staggered through her open door, </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wrapped her in his flabby arms, and whirled her around and around the room, whooping so </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">incoherently that Sansa understood not a word of it. He was as drunk as the Hound had been, </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but in him it was a dancing happy drunk. She was breathless and dizzy when he let her down. </text>
<text top="914" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">“What is it?” She clutched at a bedpost. “What’s happened? Tell me!” </text>
<text top="939" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It’s done! Done! Done! The city is saved. Lord Stannis is dead, Lord Stannis is fled, no </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">one knows, no one cares, his host is broken, the danger’s done. Slaughtered, scattered, or gone </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">over, they say. Oh, the bright banners! The banners, Jonquil, the banners! Do you have any </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="539" height="15" font="1">wine? We ought to drink to this day, yes. It means you’re safe, don’t you see?” </text>
<text top="1023" left="171" width="318" height="15" font="1">“<i>Tell me what’s happened!</i>” Sansa shook him. </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Dontos laughed and hopped from one leg to the other, almost falling. “They came up </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and they took him from the rear. Oh, to be a knight again, to have been part of it! His own </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">men hardly fought, they say. Some ran but more bent the knee and went over, shouting for </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Lord Renly! What must Stannis have thought when he heard that? I had it from Osney </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Kettleblack who had it from Ser Osmund, but Ser Balon’s back now and his men say the </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same, and the gold cloaks as well. We’re delivered, sweetling! They came up the roseroad and </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">along the riverbank, through all the fields Stannis had burned, the ashes puffing up around </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">their boots and turning all their armor grey, but oh! the <i>banners</i> must have been bright, the </text>

<text top="260" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">huntsman and Redwyne’s grapes and Lady Oakheart’s leaf. All the westermen, all the power </text>
<text top="279" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Highgarden and Casterly Rock! Lord Tywin himself had their right wing on the north side </text>
<text top="299" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of the river, with Randyll Tarly commanding the center and Mace Tyrell the left, but the </text>
<text top="318" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">vanguard won the fight. They plunged through Stannis like a lance through a pumpkin, every </text>
<text top="338" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man of them howling like some demon in steel. And do you know who led the vanguard? Do </text>

<text top="586" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">brought her a Qartheen gown, an airy confection of ivory samite patterned with seed pearls. </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="482" height="15" font="1">“Take it away,” Dany said. “The docks are no place for lady’s finery.” </text>

<text top="650" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">went to the stables, she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest, and a curved dagger hung from her medallion </text>

<text top="733" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jhiqui disagreed. “You burned the <i>maegi</i> in their house of dust and sent their souls to </text>

<text top="778" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>That was Drogon’s victory, not mine</i>, Dany wanted to say, but she held her tongue. The </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Dothraki would esteem her all the more for a few bells in her hair. She chimed as she </text>

<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">made mention of it. To guard her people and her dragons in her absence, she chose Rakharo. </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">Jhogo and Aggo would ride with her to the waterfront. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made their way through a </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street. There were </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fewer horses and camels to be seen, and a dearth of palanquins, but the streets teemed with </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">children, beggars, and skinny dogs the color of sand. Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">beneath arched doorways to watch them pass. <i>They know who I am, and they do not love me.</i> </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="334" height="15" font="1">Dany could tell from the way they looked at her. </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah would sooner have tucked her inside her palanquin, safely hidden behind silken </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">curtains, but she refused him. She had reclined too long on satin cushions, letting oxen bear </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">her hither and yon. At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was not by choice that she sought the waterfront. She was fleeing again. Her whole life </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had been one long flight, it seemed. She had begun running in her mother’s womb, and never </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">once stopped. How often had she and Viserys stolen away in the black of night, a bare step </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ahead of the Usurper’s hired knives? But it was run or die. Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her. </text>
<text top="207" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Dany had laughed when he told her. “Was it not you who told me warlocks were no more </text>

<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">me to say so, yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely, and sooner rather than later.” Xaro </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">stroked her fingers reassuringly. “You need not go alone, though. You have seen dark visions </text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">in the Palace of Dust, but Xaro has dreamed brighter dreams. I see you happily abed, with our </text>

<text top="555" left="171" width="300" height="15" font="1">His face had grown cold at that. “Then go.” </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="97" height="15" font="1">“But where?” </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="197" height="15" font="1">“Somewhere far from here.” </text>
<text top="630" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Well, perhaps it was time. The people of her <i>khalasar</i> had welcomed the chance to </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">recover from the ravages of the red waste, but now that they were plump and rested once </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">again, they began to grow unruly. Dothraki were not accustomed to staying long in one place. </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">They were a warrior people, not made for cities. Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long, </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">seduced by its comforts and its beauties. It was a city that always promised more than it </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">would give you, it seemed to her, and her welcome here had turned sour since the House of </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame. Overnight the Qartheen had </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">come to remember that dragons were <i>dangerous</i>. No longer did they vie with each other to </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">give her gifts. Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for her expulsion, and </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the Ancient Guild of Spicers for her death. It was all Xaro could do to keep the Thirteen from </text>
<text top="825" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="1">joining them. </text>
<text top="850" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>But where am I to go?</i> Ser Jorah proposed that they journey farther east, away from her </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">enemies in the Seven Kingdoms. Her bloodriders would sooner have returned to their great </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grass sea, even if it meant braving the red waste again. Dany herself had toyed with the idea </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of settling in Vaes Tolorro until her dragons grew great and strong. But her heart was full of </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">doubts. Each of these felt wrong, somehow . . . and even when she decided where to go, the </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="409" height="15" font="1">question of how she would get there remained troublesome. </text>
<text top="973" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Xaro Xhoan Daxos would be no help to her, she knew that now. For all his professions of </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">devotion, he was playing his own game, not unlike Pyat Pree. The night he asked her to leave, </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Dany had begged one last favor of him. “An army, is it?” Xaro asked. “A kettle of gold? A </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="122" height="15" font="1">galley, perhaps?” </text>
<text top="1056" left="171" width="335" height="15" font="1">Dany blushed. She hated begging. “A ship, yes.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Xaro’s eyes had glittered as brightly as the jewels in his nose. “I am a trader, <i>Khaleesi</i>. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">So perhaps we should speak no more of giving, but rather of trade. For one of your dragons, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="616" height="15" font="1">you shall have ten of the finest ships in my fleet. You need only say that one sweet word.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="107" height="15" font="1">“No,” she said. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“Alas,” Xaro sobbed, “that was not the word I meant.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="371" height="15" font="1">“Would you ask a mother to sell one of her children?” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="575" height="15" font="1">“Whyever not? They can always make more. Mothers sell their children every day.” </text>
<text top="269" left="171" width="208" height="15" font="1">“Not the Mother of Dragons.” </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="202" height="15" font="1">“Not even for twenty ships?” </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="144" height="15" font="1">“Not for a hundred.” </text>
<text top="344" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">His mouth curled downward. “I do not have a hundred. But you have three dragons. </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">Grant me one, for all my kindnesses. You will still have two and thirty ships as well.” </text>
<text top="389" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Thirty ships would be enough to land a small army on the shore of Westeros. <i>But I do not </i></text>

<text top="458" left="171" width="271" height="15" font="1">“And your colleagues in the Thirteen?” </text>
<text top="483" left="171" width="253" height="15" font="1">“Among us all, perhaps a thousand.” </text>
<text top="509" left="171" width="362" height="15" font="1">“And the Spicers and the Tourmaline Brotherhood?” </text>
<text top="534" left="171" width="274" height="15" font="1">“Their trifling fleets are of no account.” </text>
<text top="559" left="171" width="210" height="15" font="1">“Even so,” she said, “tell me.” </text>
<text top="584" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“Twelve or thirteen hundred for the Spicers. No more than eight hundred for the </text>

<text top="629" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And the Asshai’i, the Braavosi, the Summer Islanders, the Ibbenese, and all the other </text>

<text top="673" left="171" width="420" height="15" font="1">“Many and more,” he said irritably. “What does this matter?” </text>
<text top="698" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am trying to set a price on one of the three living dragons in the world.” Dany smiled </text>
<text top="718" left="139" width="609" height="15" font="1">at him sweetly. “It seems to me that one-third of all the ships in the world would be fair.” </text>
<text top="743" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Xaro’s tears ran down his cheeks on either side of his jewel-encrusted nose. “Did I not </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warn you not to enter the Palace of Dust? This is the very thing I feared. The whispers of the </text>
<text top="782" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warlocks have made you as mad as Mallarawan’s wife. A third of all the ships in the world? </text>
<text top="801" left="139" width="150" height="15" font="1">Pah. Pah, I say. Pah.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany had not seen him since. His seneschal brought her messages, each cooler than the </text>
<text top="846" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">last. She must quit his house. He was done feeding her and her people. He demanded the </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">return of his gifts, which she had accepted in bad faith. Her only consolation was that at least </text>
<text top="885" left="139" width="334" height="15" font="1">she’d had the great good sense not to marry him. </text>
<text top="910" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>The warlocks whispered of three treasons . . . once for blood and once for gold and once </i></text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>for love.</i> The first traitor was surely Mirri Maz Duur, who had murdered Khal Drogo and their </text>

<text top="968" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the third? She did not think so. What Pyat did was not for gold, and Xaro had never truly </text>

<text top="1013" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The streets grew emptier as they passed through a district given over to gloomy stone </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warehouses. Aggo went before her and Jhogo behind, leaving Ser Jorah Mormont at her side. </text>
<text top="1052" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Her bell rang softly, and Dany found her thoughts returning to the Palace of Dust once more, </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as the tongue returns to a space left by a missing tooth. <i>Child of three</i>, they had called her, </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="577" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace? The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon, red on black.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="367" height="15" font="1">“I know that. But there are no three-headed dragons.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="317" height="15" font="1">“The three heads were Aegon and his sisters.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Visenya and Rhaenys,” she recalled. “I am descended from Aegon and Rhaenys through </text>

<text top="333" left="171" width="397" height="15" font="1">“Perhaps,” she said reluctantly. “Yet the things I saw . . .” </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A dead man in the prow of a ship, a blue rose, a banquet of blood . . . what does any of </text>

<text top="402" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“A cloth dragon on poles,” Dany explained. “Mummers use them in their follies, to give </text>

<text top="447" left="171" width="133" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah frowned. </text>
<text top="472" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany could not let it go. “<i>His is the song of ice and fire</i>, my brother said. I’m certain it </text>
<text top="492" left="139" width="505" height="15" font="1">was my brother. Not Viserys, Rhaegar. He had a harp with silver strings.” </text>
<text top="517" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah’s frown deepened until his eyebrows came together. “Prince Rhaegar played </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">such a harp,” he conceded. “You saw him?” </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She nodded. “There was a woman in a bed with a babe at her breast. My brother said the </text>
<text top="581" left="139" width="501" height="15" font="1">babe was the prince that was promised and told her to name him Aegon.” </text>
<text top="606" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Prince Aegon was Rhaegar’s heir by Elia of Dorne,” Ser Jorah said. “But if he was this </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">prince that was promised, the promise was broken along with his skull when the Lannisters </text>

<text top="670" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I remember,” Dany said sadly. “They murdered Rhaegar’s daughter as well, the little </text>

<text top="734" left="171" width="210" height="15" font="1">“It’s no song I’ve ever heard.” </text>

<text top="1012" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">toward a brass-seller’s booth. “This is a noble work, my queen,” he proclaimed loudly, lifting </text>
<text top="1031" left="139" width="440" height="15" font="1">a large platter for her inspection. “See how it shines in the sun?” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The brass was polished to a high sheen. Dany could see her face in it . . . and when Ser </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Jorah angled it to the right, she could see behind her. “I see a fat brown man and an older man </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="178" height="15" font="1">with a staff. Which is it?” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="609" height="15" font="1">“Both of them,” Ser Jorah said. “They have been following us since we left <i>Quicksilver</i>.” </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The ripples in the brass stretched the strangers queerly, making one man seem long and </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">gaunt, the other immensely squat and broad. “A most excellent brass, great lady,” the </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="635" height="15" font="1">merchant exclaimed. “Bright as the sun! And for the Mother of Dragons, only thirty honors.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The platter was worth no more than three. “Where are my guards?” Dany declared. “This </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man is trying to rob me!” For Jorah, she lowered her voice and spoke in the Common Tongue. </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“They may not mean me ill. Men have looked at women since time began, perhaps it is no </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="114" height="15" font="1">more than that.” </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The brass-seller ignored their whispers. “Thirty? Did I say thirty? Such a fool I am. The </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="166" height="15" font="1">price is twenty honors.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“All the brass in this booth is not worth twenty honors,” Dany told him as she studied the </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">reflections. The old man had the look of Westeros about him, and the brown-skinned one </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">must weigh twenty stone. <i>The Usurper offered a lordship to the man who kills me, and these </i></text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="5"><i>two are far from home. Or could they be creatures of the warlocks, meant to take me </i></text>

<text top="488" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ten, <i>Khaleesi</i>, because you are so lovely. Use it for a looking glass. Only brass this fine </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">could capture such beauty.” </text>
<text top="533" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It might serve to carry nightsoil. If you threw it away, I might pick it up, so long as I did </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not need to stoop. But <i>pay</i> for it?” Dany shoved the platter back into his hands. “Worms have </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="298" height="15" font="1">crawled up your nose and eaten your wits.” </text>
<text top="597" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Eight honors,” he cried. “My wives will beat me and call me fool, but I am a helpless </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">child in your hands. Come, eight, that is less than it is worth.” </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What do I need with dull brass when Xaro Xhoan Daxos feeds me off plates of gold?” </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">As she turned to walk off, Dany let her glance sweep over the strangers. The brown man was </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">near as wide as he’d looked in the platter, with a gleaming bald head and the smooth cheeks </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">of a eunuch. A long curving <i>arakh</i> was thrust through the sweat-stained yellow silk of his </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bellyband. Above the silk, he was naked but for an absurdly tiny iron-studded vest. Old scars </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">crisscrossed his tree-trunk arms, huge chest, and massive belly, pale against his nut-brown </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">skin. </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The other man wore a traveler’s cloak of undyed wool, the hood thrown back. Long </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">white hair fell to his shoulders, and a silky white beard covered the lower half of his face. He </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">leaned his weight on a hardwood staff as tall as he was. <i>Only fools would stare so openly if </i></text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>they meant me harm.</i> All the same, it might be prudent to head back toward Jhogo and Aggo. </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“The old man does not wear a sword,” she said to Jorah in the Common Tongue as she drew </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="75" height="15" font="1">him away. </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The brass merchant came hopping after them. “Five honors, for five it is yours, it was </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="111" height="15" font="1">meant for you.” </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="502" height="15" font="1">Ser Jorah said, “A hardwood staff can crack a skull as well as any mace.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Four! I know you want it!” He danced in front of them, scampering backward as he </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="210" height="15" font="1">thrust the platter at their faces. </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="129" height="15" font="1">“Do they follow?” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lift that up a little higher,” the knight told the merchant. “Yes. The old man pretends to </text>
<text top="1065" left="139" width="453" height="15" font="1">linger at a potter’s stall, but the brown one has eyes only for you.” </text>

<page number="467" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Two honors! Two! Two!” The merchant was panting heavily from the effort of running </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">backward. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Pay him before he kills himself,” Dany told Ser Jorah, wondering what she was going to </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">do with a huge brass platter. She turned back as he reached for his coins, intending to put an </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">end to this mummer’s farce. The blood of the dragon would not be herded through the bazaar </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">by an old man and a fat eunuch. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A Qartheen stepped into her path. “Mother of Dragons, for you.” He knelt and thrust a </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">jewel box into her face. </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany took it almost by reflex. The box was carved wood, its mother-of-pearl lid inlaid </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with jasper and chalcedony. “You are too generous.” She opened it. Within was a glittering </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">green scarab carved from onyx and emerald. <i>Beautiful</i>, she thought. <i>This will help pay for our </i></text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="626" height="15" font="5"><i>passage.</i> As she reached inside the box, the man said, “I am so sorry,” but she hardly heard. </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="223" height="15" font="1">The scarab unfolded with a hiss. </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dany caught a glimpse of a malign black face, almost human, and an arched tail dripping </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">venom . . . and then the box flew from her hand in pieces, turning end over end. Sudden pain </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">twisted her fingers. As she cried out and clutched her hand, the brass merchant let out a </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shriek, a woman screamed, and suddenly the Qartheen were shouting and pushing each other </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">aside. Ser Jorah slammed past her, and Dany stumbled to one knee. She heard the <i>hiss</i> again. </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">The old man drove the butt of his staff into the ground, Aggo came riding through an </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">eggseller’s stall and vaulted from his saddle, Jhogo’s whip cracked overhead, Ser Jorah </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">slammed the eunuch over the head with the brass platter, sailors and whores and merchants </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">were fleeing or shouting or both . . . </text>
<text top="566" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace, a thousand pardons.” The old man knelt. “It’s dead. Did I break your </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="52" height="15" font="1">hand?” </text>
<text top="611" left="171" width="349" height="15" font="1">She closed her fingers, wincing. “I don’t think so.” </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“I had to knock it away,” he started, but her bloodriders were on him before he could </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="47" height="15" font="1">finish. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Aggo kicked his staff away and Jhogo seized him round the shoulders, forced him to his </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knees, and pressed a dagger to his throat. “<i>Khaleesi</i>, we saw him strike you. Would you see </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="1">the color of his blood?” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Release him.” Dany climbed to her feet. “Look at the bottom of his staff, blood of my </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">blood.” Ser Jorah had been shoved off his feet by the eunuch. She ran between them as <i>arakh</i> </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="583" height="15" font="1">and longsword both came flashing from their sheaths. “Put down your steel! Stop it!” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="583" height="15" font="1">“Your Grace?” Mormont lowered his sword only an inch. “These men attacked you.” </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They were defending me.” Dany snapped her hand to shake the sting from her fingers. </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">“It was the other one, the Qartheen.” When she looked around he was gone. “He was a </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sorrowful Man. There was a manticore in that jewel box he gave me. This man knocked it out </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of my hand.” The brass merchant was still rolling on the ground. She went to him and helped </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="240" height="15" font="1">him to his feet. “Were you stung?” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“No, good lady,” he said, shaking, “or else I would be dead. But it touched me, <i>aieeee</i>, </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">when it fell from the box it landed on my arm.” He had soiled himself, she saw, and no </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">wonder. </text>
<text top="1001" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She gave him a silver for his trouble and sent him on his way before she turned back to </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="462" height="15" font="1">the old man with the white beard. “Who is it that I owe my life to?” </text>

<text top="411" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">“We were, Your Grace,” old Whitebeard replied. “The Magister begs your kind </text>

<text top="622" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A bit old for such, aren’t you?” Ser Jorah had shouldered his way to her side, holding </text>

<text top="954" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Aggo’s <i>arakh</i> leapt to his hand. “Never have I killed a fat brown man. Belwas will be the </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Dany gave him a smile, to take a bit of the sting from the rebuke. “Now tell me, what </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He would have dragons,” said Belwas gruffly, “and the girl who makes them. He would </text>

<text top="238" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Belwas has the truth of us, Your Grace,” said Arstan. “We were told to find you and </text>

<text top="321" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Joy bloomed in her heart, but Dany kept it from her face. “I have three dragons,” she </text>

<text top="366" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It is no matter,” boomed Belwas. “We take all. The fat man hires three ships for his little </text>

<text top="411" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“It is so, Your Grace,” Arstan Whitebeard said. “The great cog <i>Saduleon</i> is berthed at the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">women who’d shared their favors with Lannister soldiers. Stripped and shaved, they were left </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">in the middle ward beside the bear pit, free for the use of any man who wanted them. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Three Frey men-at-arms were using them that morning as Arya went to the well. She </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tried not to look, but she could hear the men laughing. The pail was very heavy once full. She </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was turning to bring it back to Kingspyre when Goodwife Amabel seized her arm. The water </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">went sloshing over the side onto Amabel’s legs. “You did that on purpose,” the woman </text>

<text top="252" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“What do you want?” Arya squirmed in her grasp. Amabel had been half-crazed since </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">they’d cut Harra’s head off. </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“See there?” Amabel pointed across the yard at Pia. “When this northman falls you’ll be </text>

<text top="341" left="171" width="530" height="15" font="1">“Let me <i>go</i>.” She tried to wrench free, but Amabel only tightened her fingers. </text>
<text top="366" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He <i>will</i> fall too. Harrenhal pulls them all down in the end. Lord Tywin’s won now, he’ll </text>

<text top="450" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Arya swung the bucket. The weight of the water made it turn in her hands, so she didn’t </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smash Amabel’s head in as she wanted, but the woman let go of her anyway when the water </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">came out and drenched her. “Don’t <i>ever</i> touch me,” Arya shouted, “or I’ll <i>kill</i> you. You get </text>

<text top="597" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Three-quarters of the water had splashed out on the ground, so Arya had to return to the </text>

<text top="661" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Once, when there had been only half as many heads, Gendry had caught Arya looking at </text>

<text top="706" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">He was angry because he’d liked Lucan, she knew, but it still wasn’t fair. “It’s </text>

<text top="775" left="171" width="501" height="15" font="1">Arya punched his arm. “It was just hot broth. You hated Ser Amory too.” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“I hate this lot worse. Ser Amory was fighting for his lord, but the Mummers are </text>
<text top="820" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sellswords and turncloaks. Half of them can’t even speak the Common Tongue. Septon Utt </text>

<text top="884" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">most of the foraging for Harrenhal, and Roose Bolton had given them the task of rooting out </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Lannisters. Vargo Hoat had divided them into four bands, to visit as many villages as </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">possible. He led the largest group himself, and gave the others to his most trusted captains. </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">She had heard Rorge laughing over Lord Vargo’s way of finding traitors. All he did was </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">return to places he had visited before under Lord Tywin’s banner and seize those who had </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">helped him. Many had been bought with Lannister silver, so the Mummers often returned </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with bags of coin as well as baskets of heads. “A riddle!” Shagwell would shout gleefully. “If </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">Lord Bolton’s goat eats the men who fed Lord Lannister’s goat, how many goats are there?” </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="255" height="15" font="1">“One,” Arya said when he asked her. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Rorge and Biter were as bad as the others. Whenever Lord Bolton took a meal with the </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">so the Brave Companions made him sit down near the foot of the table where he could grunt </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">and hiss to himself and tear his meat apart with fingers and teeth. He would <i>sniff</i> at Arya when </text>

<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>was probably a lie too, like his name and even his face.</i> That made her so angry that she threw </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the coin away, but after an hour she got to feeling bad and went and found it again, even </text>

<text top="368" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She was thinking about the coin as she crossed the Flowstone Yard, struggling with the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">weight of the water in her pail. “Nan,” a voice called out. “Put down that pail and come help </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Elmar Frey was no older than she was, and short for his age besides. He had been rolling </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a barrel of sand across the uneven stone, and was red-faced from exertion. Arya went to help </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him. Together they pushed the barrel all the way to the wall and back again, then stood it </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">upright. </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She could hear the sand shifting around inside as Elmar pried open the lid and pulled out </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a chain-mail hauberk. “Do you think it’s clean enough?” As Roose Bolton’s squire, it was his </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="235" height="15" font="1">task to keep his mail shiny-bright. </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You need to shake out the sand. There’s still spots of rust. See?” She pointed. “You’d </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">best do it again.” </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“You do it.” Elmar could be friendly when he needed help, but afterward he would </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">always remember that he was a squire and she was only a serving girl. He liked to boast how </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he was the son of the Lord of the Crossing, not a nephew or a bastard or a grandson but a </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">trueborn son, and on account of that he was going to marry a princess. </text>
<text top="708" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya didn’t care about his precious princess, and didn’t like him giving her commands. </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“I have to bring m’lord water for his basin. He’s in his bedchamber being leeched. Not the </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="303" height="15" font="1">regular black leeches but the big pale ones.” </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Elmar’s eyes got as big as boiled eggs. Leeches terrified him, especially the big pale ones </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that looked like jelly until they filled up with blood. “I forgot, you’re too skinny to push such </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="112" height="15" font="1">a heavy barrel.” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I forgot, you’re stupid.” Arya picked up the pail. “Maybe you should get leeched too. </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="530" height="15" font="1">There’s leeches in the Neck as big as pigs.” She left him there with his barrel. </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The lord’s bedchamber was crowded when she entered. Qyburn was in attendance, and </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dour Walton in his mail shirt and greaves, plus a dozen Freys, all brothers, half-brothers, and </text>
<text top="920" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cousins. Roose Bolton lay abed, naked. Leeches clung to the inside of his arms and legs and </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dotted his pallid chest, long translucent things that turned a glistening pink as they fed. Bolton </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="293" height="15" font="1">paid them no more mind than he did Arya. </text>
<text top="984" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“We must not allow Lord Tywin to trap us here at Harrenhal,” Ser Aenys Frey was </text>
<text top="1004" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">saying as Arya filled the washbasin. A grey stooped giant of a man with watery red eyes and </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">huge gnarled hands, Ser Aenys had brought fifteen hundred Frey swords south to Harrenhal, </text>
<text top="1042" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">yet it often seemed as if he were helpless to command even his own brothers. “The castle is so </text>
<text top="1062" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">large it requires an army to hold it, and once surrounded we cannot <i>feed</i> an army. Nor can we </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hope to lay in sufficient supplies. The country is ash, the villages given over to wolves, the </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">We live on forage, and if the Lannisters deny that to us, we will be down to rats and shoe </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I do not mean to be besieged here.” Roose Bolton’s voice was so soft that men had to </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">strain to hear it, so his chambers were always strangely hushed. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“What, then?” demanded Ser Jared Frey, who was lean, balding, and pockmarked. “Is </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Edmure Tully so drunk on his victory that he thinks to give Lord Tywin battle in the open </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>If he does he’ll beat them</i>, Arya thought. <i>He’ll beat them as he did on the Red Fork, </i></text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="355" height="15" font="5"><i>you’ll see.</i> Unnoticed, she went to stand by Qyburn. </text>
<text top="341" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Lord Tywin is many leagues from here,” Bolton said calmly. “He has many matters yet </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="519" height="15" font="1">to settle at King’s Landing. He will not march on Harrenhal for some time.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ser Aenys shook his head stubbornly. “You do not know the Lannisters as we do, my </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lord. King Stannis thought that Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away as well, and it undid </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">him.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The pale man in the bed smiled faintly as the leeches nursed of his blood. “I am not a </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">man to be undone, ser.” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Even if Riverrun marshals all its strength and the Young Wolf wins back from the west, </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">how can we hope to match the numbers Lord Tywin can send against us? When he comes, he </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">will come with far more power than he commanded on the Green Fork. Highgarden has </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="318" height="15" font="1">joined itself to Joffrey’s cause, I remind you!” </text>
<text top="578" left="171" width="150" height="15" font="1">“I had not forgotten.” </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I have been Lord Tywin’s captive once,” said Ser Hosteen, a husky man with a square </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">face who was said to be the strongest of the Freys. “I have no wish to enjoy Lannister </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="128" height="15" font="1">hospitality again.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Ser Harys Haigh, who was a Frey on his mother’s side, nodded vigorously. “If Lord </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Tywin could defeat a seasoned man like Stannis Baratheon, what chance will our boy king </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">have against him?” He looked round to his brothers and cousins for support, and several of </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="182" height="15" font="1">them muttered agreement. </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Someone must have the courage to say it,” Ser Hosteen said. “The war is lost. King </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">Robb must be made to see that.” </text>
<text top="795" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Roose Bolton studied him with pale eyes. “His Grace has defeated the Lannisters every </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">time he has faced them in battle.” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“He has lost the north,” insisted Hosteen Frey. “He has lost <i>Winterfell!</i> His brothers are </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">dead . . .” </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">For a moment Arya forgot to breathe. <i>Dead? Bran and Rickon, dead? What does he </i></text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>mean? What does he mean about Winterfell, Joffrey could never take Winterfell, never, Robb </i></text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>would never let him.</i> Then she remembered that Robb was not at Winterfell. He was away in </text>
<text top="943" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the west, and Bran was crippled, and Rickon only four. It took all her strength to remain still </text>
<text top="962" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and silent, the way Syrio Forel had taught her, to stand there like a stick of furniture. She felt </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">tears gathering in her eyes, and willed them away. <i>It’s not true, it can’t be true, it’s just some </i></text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="95" height="15" font="5"><i>Lannister lie.</i> </text>
<text top="1026" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Had Stannis won, all might have been different,” Ronel Rivers said wistfully. He was </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">one of Lord Walder’s bastards. </text>
</page>
<page number="473" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Stannis lost,” Ser Hosteen said bluntly. “Wishing it were otherwise will not make it so. </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">King Robb must make his peace with the Lannisters. He must put off his crown and bend the </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="203" height="15" font="1">knee, little as he may like it.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“And who will tell him so?” Roose Bolton smiled. “It is a fine thing to have so many </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="490" height="15" font="1">valiant brothers in such troubled times. I shall think on all you’ve said.” </text>
<text top="213" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">His smile was dismissal. The Freys made their courtesies and shuffled out, leaving only </text>
<text top="232" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">Qyburn, Steelshanks Walton, and Arya. Lord Bolton beckoned her closer. “I am bled </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="331" height="15" font="1">sufficiently. Nan, you may remove the leeches.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“At once, my lord.” It was best never to make Roose Bolton ask twice. Arya wanted to </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ask him what Ser Hosteen had meant about Winterfell, but she dared not. <i>I’ll ask Elmar</i>, she </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought. <i>Elmar will tell me.</i> The leeches wriggled slowly between her fingers as she plucked </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them carefully from the lord’s body, their pale bodies moist to the touch and distended with </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood. <i>They’re only leeches</i>, she reminded herself. <i>If I closed my hand, they’d squish between </i></text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="5"><i>my fingers.</i> </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“There is a letter from your lady wife.” Qyburn pulled a roll of parchment from his </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sleeve. Though he wore maester’s robes, there was no chain about his neck; it was whispered </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="317" height="15" font="1">that he had lost it for dabbling in necromancy. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="219" height="15" font="1">“You may read it,” Bolton said. </text>
<text top="488" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The Lady Walda wrote from the Twins almost every day, but all the letters were the </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">same. “I pray for you morn, noon, and night, my sweet lord,” she wrote, “and count the days </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">until you share my bed again. Return to me soon, and I will give you many trueborn sons to </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">take the place of your dear Domeric and rule the Dreadfort after you.” Arya pictured a plump </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="383" height="15" font="1">pink baby in a cradle, covered with plump pink leeches. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She brought Lord Bolton a damp washcloth to wipe down his soft hairless body. “I will </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="371" height="15" font="1">send a letter of my own,” he told the onetime maester. </text>
<text top="636" left="171" width="158" height="15" font="1">“To the Lady Walda?” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="185" height="15" font="1">“To Ser Helman Tallhart.” </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">A rider from Ser Helman had come two days past. Tallhart men had taken the castle of </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="535" height="15" font="1">the Darrys, accepting the surrender of its Lannister garrison after a brief siege. </text>
<text top="731" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch, by command of the </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">king. Then he is to join forces with Robett Glover and strike east toward Duskendale. Those </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">are rich lands, and hardly touched by the fighting. It is time they had a taste. Glover has lost a </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="503" height="15" font="1">castle, and Tallhart a son. Let them take their vengeance on Duskendale.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">“I shall prepare the message for your seal, my lord.” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Arya was glad to hear that the castle of the Darrys would be burned. That was where </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they’d brought her when she’d been caught after her fight with Joffrey, and where the queen </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had made her father kill Sansa’s wolf. <i>It deserves to burn.</i> She wished that Robett Glover and </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ser Helman Tallhart would come back to Harrenhal, though; they had marched too quickly, </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="480" height="15" font="1">before she’d been able to decide whether to trust them with her secret. </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="606" height="15" font="1">“I will hunt today,” Roose Bolton announced as Qyburn helped him into a quilted jerkin. </text>
<text top="968" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Is it safe, my lord?” Qyburn asked. “Only three days past, Septon Utt’s men were </text>
<text top="987" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">attacked by wolves. They came right into his camp, not five yards from the fire, and killed </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="89" height="15" font="1">two horses.” </text>
<text top="1032" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“It is wolves I mean to hunt. I can scarcely sleep at night for the howling.” Bolton </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">buckled on his belt, adjusting the hang of sword and dagger. “It’s said that direwolves once </text>
<text top="1071" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">roamed the north in great packs of a hundred or more, and feared neither man nor mammoth, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but that was long ago and in another land. It is queer to see the common wolves of the south </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">so bold.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="321" height="15" font="1">“Terrible times breed terrible things, my lord.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bolton showed his teeth in something that might have been a smile. “Are these times so </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="131" height="15" font="1">terrible, Maester?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="384" height="15" font="1">“Summer is gone and there are four kings in the realm.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“One king may be terrible, but four?” He shrugged. “Nan, my fur cloak.” She brought it </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">to him. “My chambers will be clean and orderly upon my return,” he told her as she fastened </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="260" height="15" font="1">it. “And tend to Lady Walda’s letter.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="160" height="15" font="1">“As you say, my lord.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The lord and maester swept from the room, giving her not so much as a backward glance. </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">When they were gone, Arya took the letter and carried it to the hearth, stirring the logs with a </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">poker to wake the flames anew. She watched the parchment twist, blacken, and flare up. <i>If the </i></text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>Lannisters hurt Bran and Rickon, Robb will kill them every one. He’ll never bend the knee, </i></text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>never, never, never. He’s not afraid of any of them.</i> Curls of ash floated up the chimney. Arya </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">squatted beside the fire, watching them rise through a veil of hot tears. <i>If Winterfell is truly </i></text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>gone, is this my home now? Am I still Arya, or only Nan the serving girl, for forever and </i></text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="144" height="15" font="5"><i>forever and forever?</i> </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">She spent the next few hours tending to the lord’s chambers. She swept out the old rushes </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and scattered fresh sweet-smelling ones, laid a fresh fire in the hearth, changed the linens and </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fluffed the featherbed, emptied the chamber pots down the privy shaft and scrubbed them out, </text>
<text top="553" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">carried an armload of soiled clothing to the washerwomen, and brought up a bowl of crisp </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">autumn pears from the kitchen. When she was done with the bedchamber, she went down half </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a flight of stairs to do the same in the great solar, a spare drafty room as large as the halls of </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">many a smaller castle. The candles were down to stubs, so Arya changed them out. Under the </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">windows was a huge oaken table where the lord wrote his letters. She stacked the books, </text>

<text top="836" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Weese or even Pinkeye, though they required dressing like a page and washing more than she </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="588" height="15" font="1">liked. The hunt would not return for hours, so she had a little time for her needlework. </text>

<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grey-brown beasts, savage and powerful, their mouths drawn back over long yellow teeth by </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">their dying snarls. But the other two had only been pups. Lord Bolton gave orders for the </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">skins to be sewn into a blanket for his bed. “Cubs still have that soft fur, my lord,” one of his </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="395" height="15" font="1">men pointed out. “Make you a nice warm pair of gloves.” </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bolton glanced up at the banners waving above the gatehouse towers. “As the Starks are </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wont to remind us, winter is coming. Have it done.” When he saw Arya looking on, he said, </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“Nan, I’ll want a flagon of hot spice wine, I took a chill in the woods. See that it doesn’t get </text>

<text top="433" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“At once, my lord.” That was always the best thing to say. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Hot Pie was making oatcakes when she entered the kitchen. Three other cooks were </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">boning fish, while a spit boy turned a boar over the flames. “My lord wants his supper, and </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hot spice wine to wash it down,” Arya announced, “and he doesn’t want it cold.” One of the </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cooks washed his hands, took out a kettle, and filled it with a heavy, sweet red. Hot Pie was </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">told to crumble in the spices as the wine heated. Arya went to help. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="550" height="15" font="1">“I can do it,” he said sullenly. “I don’t need you to show me how to spice wine.” </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>He hates me too, or else he’s scared of me.</i> She backed away, more sad than angry. When </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the food was ready, the cooks covered it with a silver cover and wrapped the flagon in a thick </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">towel to keep it warm. Dusk was settling outside. On the walls the crows muttered round the </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heads like courtiers round a king. One of the guards held the door to Kingspyre. “Hope that’s </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">not weasel soup,” he jested. </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Roose Bolton was seated by the hearth reading from a thick leather-bound book when </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">she entered. “Light some candles,” he commanded her as he turned a page. “It grows gloomy </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="63" height="15" font="1">in here.” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She placed the food at his elbow and did as he bid her, filling the room with flickering </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">light and the scent of cloves. Bolton turned a few more pages with his finger, then closed the </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">book and placed it carefully in the fire. He watched the flames consume it, pale eyes shining </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with reflected light. The old dry leather went up with a <i>whoosh</i>, and the yellow pages stirred </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">as they burned, as if some ghost were reading them. “I will have no further need of you </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="264" height="15" font="1">tonight,” he said, never looking at her. </text>
<text top="875" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">She should have gone, silent as a mouse, but something had hold of her. “My lord,” she </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="434" height="15" font="1">asked, “will you take me with you when you leave Harrenhal?” </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He turned to stare at her, and from the look in his eyes it was as if his supper had just </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="410" height="15" font="1">spoken to him. “Did I give you leave to question me, Nan?” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="259" height="15" font="1">“No, my lord.” She lowered her eyes. </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="344" height="15" font="1">“You should not have spoken, then. Should you?” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="108" height="15" font="1">“No. My lord.” </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">For a moment he looked amused. “I will answer you, just this once. I mean to give </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="585" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal to Lord Vargo when I return to the north. You will remain here, with him.” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="191" height="15" font="1">“But I don’t—” she started. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He cut her off. “I am not in the habit of being questioned by servants, Nan. Must I have </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="127" height="15" font="1">your tongue out?” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="573" height="15" font="1">He would do it as easily as another man might cuff a dog, she knew. “No, my lord.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">“Then I’ll hear no more from you?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="106" height="15" font="1">“No, my lord.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="274" height="15" font="1">“Go, then. I shall forget this insolence.” </text>
<text top="274" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya went, but not to her bed. When she stepped out into the darkness of the yard, the </text>
<text top="294" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">guard on the door nodded at her and said, “Storm coming. Smell the air?” The wind was </text>
<text top="313" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gusting, flames swirling off the torches mounted atop the walls beside the rows of heads. On </text>
<text top="333" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her way to the godswood, she passed the Wailing Tower where once she had lived in fear of </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Weese. The Freys had taken it for their own since Harrenhal’s fall. She could hear angry </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">voices coming from a window, many men talking and arguing all at once. Elmar was sitting </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">on the steps outside, alone. </text>
<text top="416" left="171" width="548" height="15" font="1">“What’s wrong?” Arya asked him when she saw the tears shining on his cheeks. </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“My princess,” he sobbed. “We’ve been dishonored, Aenys says. There was a bird from </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="545" height="15" font="1">the Twins. My lord father says I’ll need to marry someone else, or be a septon.” </text>
<text top="486" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>A stupid princess</i>, she thought, <i>that’s nothing to cry over.</i> “My brothers might be dead,” </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="94" height="15" font="1">she confided. </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="537" height="15" font="1">Elmar gave her a scornful look. “No one cares about a serving girl’s brothers.” </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">It was hard not to hit him when he said that. “I hope your princess dies,” she said, and ran </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">off before he could grab her. In the godswood she found her broomstick sword where she had </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">left it, and carried it to the heart tree. There she knelt. Red leaves rustled. Red eyes peered </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="523" height="15" font="1">inside her. <i>The eyes of the gods.</i> “Tell me what to do, you gods,” she prayed. </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">For a long moment there was no sound but the wind and the water and the creak of leaf </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">and limb. And then, far far off, beyond the godswood and the haunted towers and the </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">immense stone walls of Harrenhal, from somewhere out in the world, came the long lonely </text>
<text top="698" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">howl of a wolf. Gooseprickles rose on Arya’s skin, and for an instant she felt dizzy. Then, so </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">faintly, it seemed as if she heard her father’s voice. “When the snows fall and the white winds </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives,” he said. </text>
<text top="762" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“But there is no pack,” she whispered to the weirwood. Bran and Rickon were dead, the </text>
<text top="781" left="139" width="563" height="15" font="1">Lannisters had Sansa, Jon had gone to the Wall. “I’m not even me now, I’m Nan.” </text>
<text top="806" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You are Arya of Winterfell, daughter of the north. You told me you could be strong. </text>
<text top="826" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">You have the wolf blood in you.” </text>
<text top="851" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The wolf blood.” Arya remembered now. “I’ll be as strong as Robb. I said I would.” </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">She took a deep breath, then lifted the broomstick in both hands and brought it down across </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">her knee. It broke with a loud crack, and she threw the pieces aside. <i>I am a direwolf, and done </i></text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="132" height="15" font="5"><i>with wooden teeth.</i> </text>
<text top="934" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">That night she lay in her narrow bed upon the scratchy straw, listening to the voices of </text>
<text top="954" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the living and the dead whisper and argue as she waited for the moon to rise. They were the </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">only voices she trusted anymore. She could hear the sound of her own breath, and the wolves </text>
<text top="993" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as well, a great pack of them now. <i>They are closer than the one I heard in the godswood</i>, she </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">thought. <i>They are calling to me.</i> </text>
<text top="1037" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Finally she slipped from under the blanket, wriggled into a tunic, and padded barefoot </text>
<text top="1057" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">down the stairs. Roose Bolton was a cautious man, and the entrance to Kingspyre was </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">guarded day and night, so she had to slip out of a narrow cellar window. The yard was still, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">the great castle lost in haunted dreams. Above, the wind keened through the Wailing Tower. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">At the forge she found the fires extinguished and the doors closed and barred. She crept </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">in a window, as she had once before. Gendry shared a mattress with two other apprentice </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smiths. She crouched in the loft for a long time before her eyes adjusted enough for her to be </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sure that he was the one on the end. Then she put a hand over his mouth and pinched him. His </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">eyes opened. He could not have been very deeply asleep. “<i>Please</i>,” she whispered. She took </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">her hand off his mouth and pointed. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">For a moment she did not think he understood, but then he slid out from under the </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blankets. Naked, he padded across the room, shrugged into a loose rough-spun tunic, and </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">climbed down from the loft after her. The other sleepers did not stir. “What do you want </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="282" height="15" font="1">now?” Gendry said in a low angry voice. </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="81" height="15" font="1">“A sword.” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Blackthumb keeps all the blades locked up, I told you that a hundred times. Is this for </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="98" height="15" font="1">Lord Leech?” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“For me. Break the lock with your hammer.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">“They’ll break my hand,” he grumbled. “Or worse.” </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="203" height="15" font="1">“Not if you run off with me.” </text>
<text top="500" left="171" width="288" height="15" font="1">“Run, and they’ll catch you and kill you.” </text>
<text top="525" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“They’ll do you worse. Lord Bolton is giving Harrenhal to the Bloody Mummers, he told </text>
<text top="544" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">me so.” </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="330" height="15" font="1">Gendry pushed black hair out of his eyes. “So?” </text>
<text top="595" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She looked right at him, fearless. “So when Vargo Hoat’s the lord, he’s going to cut off </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="526" height="15" font="1">the feet of all the servants to keep them from running away. The smiths too.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="280" height="15" font="1">“That’s only a story,” he said scornfully. </text>
<text top="664" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“No, it’s true, I heard Lord Vargo say so,” she lied. “He’s going to cut one foot off </text>
<text top="684" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">everyone. The left one. Go to the kitchens and wake Hot Pie, he’ll do what you say. We’ll </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">need bread or oatcakes or something. You get the swords and I’ll do the horses. We’ll meet </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="605" height="15" font="1">near the postern in the east wall, behind the Tower of Ghosts. No one ever comes there.” </text>
<text top="748" left="171" width="338" height="15" font="1">“I know that gate. It’s guarded, same as the rest.” </text>
<text top="773" left="171" width="251" height="15" font="1">“So? You won’t forget the swords?” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="167" height="15" font="1">“I never said I’d come.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“No. But if you do, you won’t forget the swords?” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="358" height="15" font="1">He frowned. “No,” he said at last. “I guess I won’t.” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Arya reentered Kingspyre the same way she had left it, and stole up the winding steps </text>
<text top="893" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">listening for footfalls. In her cell, she stripped to the skin and dressed herself carefully, in two </text>
<text top="912" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">layers of smallclothes, warm stockings, and her cleanest tunic. It was Lord Bolton’s livery. </text>
<text top="932" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">On the breast was sewn his sigil, the flayed man of the Dreadfort. She tied her shoes, threw a </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wool cloak over her skinny shoulders, and knotted it under her throat. Quiet as a shadow, she </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moved back down the stairs. Outside the lord’s solar she paused to listen at the door, easing it </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="286" height="15" font="1">open slowly when she heard only silence. </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The sheepskin map was on the table, beside the remains of Lord Bolton’s supper. She </text>
<text top="1035" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rolled it up tight and thrust it through her belt. He’d left his dagger on the table as well, so she </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="344" height="15" font="1">took that too, just in case Gendry lost his courage. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">A horse neighed softly as she slipped into the darkened stables. The grooms were all </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="576" height="15" font="1">asleep. She prodded one with her toe until he sat up groggily and said, “Eh? Whas?” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“Lord Bolton requires three horses saddled and bridled.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The boy got to his feet, pushing straw from his hair. “Wha, at this hour? Horses, you </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="560" height="15" font="1">say?” He blinked at the sigil on her tunic. “Whas he want horses for, in the dark?” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="599" height="15" font="1">“Lord Bolton is not in the habit of being questioned by servants.” She crossed her arms. </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The stableboy was still looking at the flayed man. He knew what it meant. “Three, you </text>

<text top="288" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“One two three. Hunting horses. Fast and surefoot.” Arya helped him with the bridles and </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">saddles, so he would not need to wake any of the others. She hoped they would not hurt him </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="316" height="15" font="1">afterward, but she knew they probably would. </text>
<text top="352" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Leading the horses across the castle was the worst part. She stayed in the shadow of the </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">curtain wall whenever she could, so the sentries walking their rounds on the ramparts above </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would have needed to look almost straight down to see her. <i>And if they do, what of it? I’m my </i></text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>lord’s own cupbearer.</i> It was a chill dank autumn night. Clouds were blowing in from the </text>
<text top="430" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">west, hiding the stars, and the Wailing Tower screamed mournfully at every gust of wind. <i>It </i></text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="597" height="15" font="5"><i>smells like rain.</i> Arya did not know whether that would be good or bad for their escape. </text>
<text top="475" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No one saw her, and she saw no one, only a grey-and-white cat creeping along atop the </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">godswood wall. It stopped and spit at her, waking memories of the Red Keep and her father </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and Syrio Forel. “I could catch you if I wanted,” she called to it softly, “but I have to go, cat.” </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="225" height="15" font="1">The cat hissed again and ran off. </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Tower of Ghosts was the most ruinous of Harrenhal’s five immense towers. It stood </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dark and desolate behind the remains of a collapsed sept where only rats had come to pray for </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">near three hundred years. It was there she waited to see if Gendry and Hot Pie would come. It </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">seemed as though she waited a long time. The horses nibbled at the weeds that grew up </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">between the broken stones while the clouds swallowed the last of the stars. Arya took out the </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">dagger and sharpened it to keep her hands busy. Long smooth strokes, the way Syrio had </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="235" height="15" font="1">taught her. The sound calmed her. </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She heard them coming long before she saw them. Hot Pie was breathing heavily, and </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">once he stumbled in the dark, barked his shin, and cursed loud enough to wake half of </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Harrenhal. Gendry was quieter, but the swords he was carrying rang together as he moved. </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="376" height="15" font="1">“Here I am.” She stood. “Be quiet or they’ll hear you.” </text>
<text top="784" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The boys picked their way toward her over tumbled stones. Gendry was wearing oiled </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">chain-mail under his cloak, she saw, and he had his blacksmith’s hammer slung across his </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back. Hot Pie’s red round face peered out from under a hood. He had a sack of bread dangling </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">from his right hand and a big wheel of cheese under his left arm. “There’s a guard on that </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="402" height="15" font="1">postern,” said Gendry quietly. “I told you there would be.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="610" height="15" font="1">“You stay here with the horses,” said Arya. “I’ll get rid of him. Come quick when I call.” </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="527" height="15" font="1">Gendry nodded. Hot Pie said, “Hoot like an owl when you want us to come.” </text>
<text top="937" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">“I’m not an owl,” said Arya. “I’m a wolf. I’ll howl.” </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Alone, she slid through the shadow of the Tower of Ghosts. She walked fast, to keep </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ahead of her fear, and it felt as though Syrio Forel walked beside her, and Yoren, and Jaqen </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">H’ghar, and Jon Snow. She had not taken the sword Gendry had brought her, not yet. For this </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the dagger would be better. It was good and sharp. This postern was the least of Harrenhal’s </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">gates, a narrow door of stout oak studded with iron nails, set in an angle of the wall beneath a </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">defensive tower. Only one man was set to guard it, but she knew there would be sentries up in </text>

<page number="479" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that tower as well, and others nearby walking the walls. Whatever happened, she must be </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">quiet as a shadow. <i>He must not call out.</i> A few scattered raindrops had begun to fall. She felt </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="360" height="15" font="1">one land on her brow and run slowly down her nose. </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She made no effort to hide, but approached the guard openly, as if Lord Bolton himself </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">had sent her. He watched her come, curious as to what might bring a page here at this black </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hour. When she got closer, she saw that he was a northman, very tall and thin, huddled in a </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ragged fur cloak. That was bad. She might have been able to trick a Frey or one of the Brave </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Companions, but the Dreadfort men had served Roose Bolton their whole life, and they knew </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">him better than she did. <i>If I tell him I am Arya Stark and command him to stand aside . . .</i> No, </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="614" height="15" font="1">she dare not. He was a northman, but not a Winterfell man. He belonged to Roose Bolton. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When she reached him she pushed back her cloak so he would see the flayed man on her </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">breast. “Lord Bolton sent me.” </text>
<text top="355" left="171" width="176" height="15" font="1">“At this hour? Why for?” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">She could see the gleam of steel under the fur, and she did not know if she was strong </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">enough to drive the point of the dagger through chain-mail. <i>His throat, it must be his throat, </i></text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>but he’s too tall, I’ll never reach it.</i> For a moment she did not know what to say. For a </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="578" height="15" font="1">moment she was a little girl again, and scared, and the rain on her face felt like tears. </text>
<text top="463" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“He told me to give all his guards a silver piece, for their good service.” The words </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="224" height="15" font="1">seemed to come out of nowhere. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Silver, you say?” He did not believe her, but he <i>wanted</i> to; silver was silver, after all. </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="142" height="15" font="1">“Give it over, then.” </text>
<text top="553" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Her fingers dug down beneath her tunic and came out clutching the coin Jaqen had given </text>
<text top="572" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her. In the dark the iron could pass for tarnished silver. She held it out . . . and let it slip </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="138" height="15" font="1">through her fingers. </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Cursing her softly, the man went to a knee to grope for the coin in the dirt and there was </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his neck right in front of her. Arya slid her dagger out and drew it across his throat, as smooth </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">as summer silk. His blood covered her hands in a hot gush and he tried to shout but there was </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="188" height="15" font="1">blood in his mouth as well. </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="312" height="15" font="1">“<i>Valar morghulis</i>,” she whispered as he died. </text>
<text top="725" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When he stopped moving, she picked up the coin. Outside the walls of Harrenhal, a wolf </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">howled long and loud. She lifted the bar, set it aside, and pulled open the heavy oak door. By </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">the time Hot Pie and Gendry came up with the horses, the rain was falling hard. “You <i>killed</i> </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="155" height="15" font="1">him!” Hot Pie gasped. </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“What did you think I would do?” Her fingers were sticky with blood, and the smell was </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">making her mare skittish. <i>It’s no matter</i>, she thought, swinging up into the saddle. <i>The rain </i></text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="194" height="15" font="5"><i>will wash them clean again.</i> </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Dontos wore new suits of motley, clean as a spring morning. Even Lady Tanda and her </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">daughters looked pretty in matching gowns of turquoise silk and vair, and Lord Gyles was </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">coughing into a square of scarlet silk trimmed with golden lace. King Joffrey sat above them </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">all, amongst the blades and barbs of the Iron Throne. He was in crimson samite, his black </text>

<text top="207" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Squirming through a press of knights, squires, and rich townfolk, Sansa reached the front </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="589" height="15" font="1">of the gallery just as a blast of trumpets announced the entry of Lord Tywin Lannister. </text>
<text top="252" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He rode his warhorse down the length of the hall and dismounted before the Iron Throne. </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Sansa had never seen such armor; all burnished red steel, inlaid with golden scrollwork and </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ornamentation. His rondels were sunbursts, the roaring lion that crowned his helm had ruby </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">eyes, and a lioness on each shoulder fastened a cloth-of-gold cloak so long and heavy that it </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">draped the hindquarters of his charger. Even the horse’s armor was gilded, and his bardings </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">were shimmering crimson silk emblazoned with the lion of Lannister. </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Lord of Casterly Rock made such an impressive figure that it was a shock when his </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">destrier dropped a load of dung right at the base of the throne. Joffrey had to step gingerly </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">around it as he descended to embrace his grandfather and proclaim him Savior of the City. </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="1">Sansa covered her mouth to hide a nervous smile. </text>
<text top="458" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Joff made a show of asking his grandfather to assume governance of the realm, and Lord </text>

<text top="561" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A fanfare of brazen trumpets greeted each of the heroes as he stepped between the great </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">oaken doors. Heralds cried his name and deeds for all to hear, and the noble knights and </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">highborn ladies cheered as lustily as cutthroats at a cockfight. Pride of place was given to </text>

<text top="639" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">His sons followed him in; Ser Loras and his older brother Ser Garlan the Gallant. The three </text>

<text top="683" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The king descended the throne once more to greet them, a great honor. He fastened about </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the throat of each a chain of roses wrought in soft yellow gold, from which hung a golden disc </text>
<text top="722" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with the lion of Lannister picked out in rubies. “The roses support the lion, as the might of </text>

<text top="856" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Joffrey drew the Knight of Flowers to his feet and kissed him on his cheek. “Done, </text>

<text top="901" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Lord Tyrell bowed his head. “There is no greater pleasure than to serve the King’s Grace. </text>

<text top="1029" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">though his face was comely enough, he lacked Ser Loras’s startling beauty. “Your Grace,” </text>

<text top="143" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">you to send for her, to take her hand in marriage, and to wed your House to mine for all time.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">King Joffrey made a show of looking surprised. “Ser Garlan, your sister’s beauty is </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">famed throughout the Seven Kingdoms, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">word.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Queen Cersei got to her feet in a rustle of skirts. “Your Grace, in the judgment of your </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">small council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne even now. </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Sire, your councilors beg you, for the good of your realm, set Sansa Stark aside. The Lady </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="358" height="15" font="1">Margaery will make you a far more suitable queen.” </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Like a pack of trained dogs, the lords and ladies in the hall began to shout their pleasure. </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="595" height="15" font="1">“<i>Margaery</i>,” they called. “Give us Margaery!” and “No traitor queens! Tyrell! Tyrell!” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Joffrey raised a hand. “I would like to heed the wishes of my people, Mother, but I took a </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">holy vow.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The High Septon stepped forward. “Your Grace, the gods hold betrothal solemn, but your </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">father, King Robert of blessed memory, made this pact before the Starks of Winterfell had </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">revealed their falseness. Their crimes against the realm have freed you from any promise you </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">might have made. So far as the Faith is concerned, there is no valid marriage contract ‘twixt </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="154" height="15" font="1">you and Sansa Stark.” </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A tumult of cheering filled the throne room, and cries of “<i>Margaery, Margaery</i>,” erupted </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">all around her. Sansa leaned forward, her hands tight around the gallery’s wooden rail. She </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knew what came next, but she was still frightened of what Joffrey might say, afraid that he </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">would refuse to release her even now, when his whole kingdom depended upon it. She felt as </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">if she were back again on the marble steps outside the Great Sept of Baelor, waiting for her </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">prince to grant her father mercy, and instead hearing him command Ilyn Payne to strike off </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="493" height="15" font="1">his head. <i>Please</i>, she prayed fervently, <i>make him say it, make him say it.</i> </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin was looking at his grandson. Joff gave him a sullen glance, shifted his feet, </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and helped Ser Garlan Tyrell to rise. “The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. I will </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wed your sweet sister, and gladly, ser.” He kissed Ser Garlan on a bearded cheek as the cheers </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="1">rose all around them. </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sansa felt curiously light-headed. <i>I am free.</i> She could feel eyes upon her. <i>I must not </i></text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>smile</i>, she reminded herself. The queen had warned her; no matter what she felt inside, the </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face she showed the world must look distraught. “I will not have my son humiliated,” Cersei </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="171" height="15" font="1">said. “Do you hear me?” </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="410" height="15" font="1">“Yes. But if I’m not to be queen, what will become of me?” </text>
<text top="862" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“That will need to be determined. For the moment, you shall remain here at court, as our </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">ward.” </text>
<text top="906" left="171" width="147" height="15" font="1">“I want to go home.” </text>
<text top="931" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The queen was irritated by that. “You should have learned by now, none of us get the </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">things we want.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I have, though</i>, Sansa thought. <i>I am free of Joffrey. I will not have to kiss him, nor give </i></text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="5"><i>him my maidenhood, nor bear him children. Let Margaery Tyrell have all that, poor girl.</i> </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">By the time the outburst died down, the Lord of Highgarden had been seated at the </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Sansa tried to look forlorn and abandoned as other heroes of the Battle of the Blackwater were </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">summoned forth to receive their rewards. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Paxter Redwyne, Lord of the Arbor, marched down the length of the hall flanked by his </text>

<text top="291" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">Next came four of lesser birth who had distinguished themselves in the fighting: the one-</text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">eyed knight Ser Philip Foote, who had slain Lord Bryce Caron in single combat; the freerider </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lothor Brune, who’d cut his way through half a hundred Fossoway men-at-arms to capture </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Ser Jon of the green apple and kill Ser Bryan and Ser Edwyd of the red, thereby winning </text>

<text top="388" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Harys Swyft, who’d pulled his master from beneath his dying horse and defended him against </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a dozen attackers; and a downy-cheeked squire named Josmyn Peckledon, who had killed two </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knights, wounded a third, and captured two more, though he could not have been more than </text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="477" height="15" font="1">fourteen. Willit was borne in on a litter, so grievous were his wounds. </text>
<text top="471" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">Ser Kevan had taken a seat beside his brother Lord Tywin. When the heralds had finished </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">telling of each hero’s deeds, he rose. “It is His Grace’s wish that these good men be rewarded </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for their valor. By his decree, Ser Philip shall henceforth be Lord Philip of House Foote, and </text>

<text top="549" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the estate of knighthood, and granted land and keep in the riverlands at war’s end. To Josmyn </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Peckledon, a sword and suit of plate, his choice of any warhorse in the royal stables, and </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knighthood as soon as he shall come of age. And lastly, for Goodman Willit, a spear with a </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">silver-banded haft, a hauberk of new-forged ringmail, and a full helm with visor. Further, the </text>

<text top="666" left="139" width="527" height="15" font="1">loyally and well. To all this, the King’s Hand and the small council consent.” </text>
<text top="691" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The captains of the king’s warships <i>Wildwind</i>,  <i>Prince Aemon</i>, and <i>River Arrow</i> were </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">honored next, along with some under-officers from <i>Godsgrace</i>,  <i>Lance</i>,  <i>Lady of Silk</i>, and </text>
<text top="730" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>Ramshead</i>. As near as Sansa could tell, their chief accomplishment had been surviving the </text>
<text top="750" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">battle on the river, a feat that few enough could boast. Hallyne the Pyromancer and the </text>
<text top="769" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">masters of the Alchemists’ Guild received the king’s thanks as well, and Hallyne was raised </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to the style of lord, though Sansa noted that neither lands nor castle accompanied the title, </text>
<text top="808" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">which made the alchemist no more a <i>true</i> lord than Varys was. A more significant lordship by </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">far was granted to Ser Lancel Lannister. Joffrey awarded him the lands, castle, and rights of </text>
<text top="847" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">House Darry, whose last child lord had perished during the fighting in the riverlands, “leaving </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="462" height="15" font="1">no trueborn heirs of lawful Darry blood, but only a bastard cousin.” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Lancel did not appear to accept the title; the talk was, his wound might cost him his </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="611" height="15" font="1">arm or even his life. The Imp was said to be dying as well, from a terrible cut to the head. </text>
<text top="936" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the herald called, “<i>Lord Petyr Baelish</i>,” he came forth dressed all in shades of rose </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and plum, his cloak patterned with mockingbirds. She could see him smiling as he knelt </text>
<text top="975" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">before the Iron Throne. <i>He looks so pleased.</i> Sansa had not heard of Littlefinger doing </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="641" height="15" font="1">anything especially heroic during the battle, but it seemed he was to be rewarded all the same. </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Kevan got back to his feet. “It is the wish of the King’s Grace that his loyal councilor </text>

<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">On his knees, Littlefinger raised his eyes to King Joffrey. “I thank you humbly, Your </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">Grace. I suppose this means I’ll need to see about getting some sons and grandsons.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Joffrey laughed, and the court with him. <i>Lord Paramount of the Trident</i>, Sansa thought, </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>and Lord of Harrenhal as well.</i> She did not understand why that should make him so happy; </text>
<text top="271" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the honors were as empty as the title granted to Hallyne the Pyromancer. Harrenhal was </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">cursed, everyone knew that, and the Lannisters did not even hold it at present. Besides, the </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lords of the Trident were sworn to Riverrun and House Tully, and to the King in the North; </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">they would never accept Littlefinger as their liege. <i>Unless they are made to. Unless my </i></text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>brother and my uncle and my grandfather are all cast down and killed.</i> The thought made </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Sansa anxious, but she told herself she was being silly. <i>Robb has beaten them every time. </i></text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="269" height="15" font="5"><i>He’ll beat Lord Baelish too, if he must.</i> </text>
<text top="413" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">More than six hundred new knights were made that day. They had held their vigil in the </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Great Sept of Baelor all through the night and crossed the city barefoot that morning to prove </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their humble hearts. Now they came forward dressed in shifts of undyed wool to receive their </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">knighthoods from the Kingsguard. It took a long time, since only three of the Brothers of the </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">White Sword were on hand to dub them. Mandon Moore had perished in the battle, the Hound </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had vanished, Aerys Oakheart was in Dorne with Princess Myrcella, and Jaime Lannister was </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Robb’s captive, so the Kingsguard had been reduced to Balon Swann, Meryn Trant, and </text>
<text top="549" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Osmund Kettleblack. Once knighted, each man rose, buckled on his swordbelt, and stood </text>
<text top="569" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">beneath the windows. Some had bloody feet from their walk through the city, but they stood </text>
<text top="588" left="139" width="322" height="15" font="1">tall and proud all the same, it seemed to Sansa. </text>
<text top="613" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">By the time all the new knights had been given their <i>sers</i> the hall was growing restive, </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and none more so than Joffrey. Some of those in the gallery had begun to slip quietly away, </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">but the notables on the floor were trapped, unable to depart without the king’s leave. Judging </text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">by the way he was fidgeting atop the Iron Throne, Joff would willingly have granted it, but </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the day’s work was far from done. For now the coin was turned over, and the captives were </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="79" height="15" font="1">ushered in. </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There were great lords and noble knights in that company too: sour old Lord Celtigar, the </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Red Crab; Ser Bonifer the Good; Lord Estermont, more ancient even than Celtigar; Lord </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Varner, who hobbled the length of the hall on a shattered knee, but would accept no help; Ser </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Mark Mullendore, grey-faced, his left arm gone to the elbow; fierce Red Ronnet of Griffin </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Roost; Ser Dermot of the Rainwood; Lord Willurn and his sons Josua and Elyas; Ser Jon </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Fossoway; Ser Timon the Scrapesword; Aurane, the bastard of Driftmark; Lord Staedmon, </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="265" height="15" font="1">called Pennylover; hundreds of others. </text>
<text top="878" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Those who had changed their allegiance during the battle needed only to swear fealty to </text>
<text top="897" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Joffrey, but the ones who had fought for Stannis until the bitter end were compelled to speak. </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Their words decided their fate. If they begged forgiveness for their treasons and promised to </text>
<text top="936" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">serve loyally henceforth, Joffrey welcomed them back into the king’s peace and restored them </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">to all their lands and rights. A handful remained defiant, however. “Do not imagine this is </text>
<text top="975" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">done, boy,” warned one, the bastard son of some Florent or other. “The Lord of Light protects </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">King Stannis, now and always. All your swords and all your scheming shall not save you </text>
<text top="1014" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">when his hour comes.” </text>
<text top="1039" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Your</i> hour is come right now.” Joffrey beckoned to Ser Ilyn Payne to take the man out </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="1">and strike his head off. </text>
</page>
<page number="484" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">But no sooner had that one been dragged away than a knight of solemn mien with a fiery </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">heart on his surcoat shouted out, “Stannis is the true king! A monster sits the Iron Throne, an </text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="297" height="15" font="1">“Be silent,” Ser Kevan Lannister bellowed. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The knight raised his voice instead. “Joffrey is the black worm eating the heart of the </text>

<text top="271" left="139" width="520" height="15" font="1">continued to shout. “The scouring fire will come! King Stannis will return!” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Joffrey lurched to his feet. “<i>I’m</i> king! Kill him! Kill him now! I command it.” He </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">chopped down with his hand, a furious, angry gesture . . . and screeched in pain when his arm </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brushed against one of the sharp metal fangs that surrounded him. The bright crimson samite </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="642" height="15" font="1">of his sleeve turned a darker shade of red as his blood soaked through it. “<i>Mother!</i>” he wailed. </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">With every eye on the king, somehow the man on the floor wrested a spear away from </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one of the gold cloaks, and used it to push himself back to his feet. “The throne denies him!” </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="177" height="15" font="1">he cried. “<i>He is no king!</i>” </text>
<text top="444" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Cersei was running toward the throne, but Lord Tywin remained still as stone. He had </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">only to raise a finger, and Ser Meryn Trant moved forward with drawn sword. The end was </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">quick and brutal. The gold cloaks seized the knight by the arms. “<i>No king!</i>” he cried again as </text>
<text top="502" left="139" width="425" height="15" font="1">Ser Meryn drove the point of his longsword through his chest. </text>
<text top="527" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Joff fell into his mother’s arms. Three maesters came hurrying forward, to bundle him </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">out through the king’s door. Then everyone began talking at once. When the gold cloaks </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dragged off the dead man, he left a trail of bright blood across the stone floor. Lord Baelish </text>
<text top="586" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">stroked his beard while Varys whispered in his ear. <i>Will they dismiss us now?</i> Sansa </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wondered. A score of captives still waited, though whether to pledge fealty or shout curses, </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="110" height="15" font="1">who could say? </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Lord Tywin rose to his feet. “We continue,” he said in a clear strong voice that silenced </text>
<text top="669" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the murmurs. “Those who wish to ask pardon for their treasons may do so. We will have no </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">more follies.” He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated himself on a step, a mere three </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="120" height="15" font="1">feet off the floor. </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The light outside the windows was fading by the time the session drew to a close. Sansa </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">felt limp with exhaustion as she made her way down from the gallery. She wondered how </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">badly Joffrey had cut himself. <i>They say the Iron Throne can be perilous cruel to those who </i></text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="164" height="15" font="5"><i>were not meant to sit it.</i> </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Back in the safety of her own chambers, she hugged a pillow to her face to muffle a </text>
<text top="836" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">squeal of joy. <i>Oh, gods be good, he did it, he put me aside in front of everyone.</i> When a </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">serving girl brought her supper, she almost kissed her. There was hot bread and fresh-churned </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">butter, a thick beef soup, capon and carrots, and peaches in honey. <i>Even the food tastes </i></text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="147" height="15" font="5"><i>sweeter</i>, she thought. </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Come dark, she slipped into a cloak and left for the godswood. Ser Osmund Kettleblack </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was guarding the drawbridge in his white armor. Sansa tried her best to sound miserable as </text>
<text top="959" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">she bid him a good evening. From the way he leered at her, she was not sure she had been </text>
<text top="978" left="139" width="135" height="15" font="1">wholly convincing. </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Dontos waited in the leafy moonlight. “Why so sad-faced?” Sansa asked him gaily. “You </text>
<text top="1023" left="139" width="478" height="15" font="1">were there, you heard. Joff put me aside, he’s done with me, he’s . . .” </text>
<text top="1048" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">He took her hand. “Oh, Jonquil, my poor Jonquil, you do not understand. Done with you? </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">Her heart sank. “What do you mean?” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">“The queen will never let you go, never. You are too valuable a hostage. And </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Joffrey . . . sweetling, he is still king. If he wants you in his bed, he will have you, only now it </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="343" height="15" font="1">“<i>No</i>,” Sansa said, shocked. “He let me go, he . . .” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Dontos planted a slobbery kiss on her ear. “Be brave. I swore to see you home, and </text>

<text top="263" left="171" width="301" height="15" font="1">“When?” Sansa asked. “When will we go?” </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The night of Joffrey’s wedding. After the feast. All the necessary arrangements have </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">been made. The Red Keep will be full of strangers. Half the court will be drunk and the other </text>
<text top="327" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">half will be helping Joffrey bed his bride. For a little while, you will be forgotten, and the </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="205" height="15" font="1">confusion will be our friend.” </text>
<text top="372" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The wedding won’t be for a moon’s turn yet. Margaery Tyrell is at Highgarden, they’ve </text>

<text top="416" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“You’ve waited so long, be patient a while longer. Here, I have something for you.” Ser </text>
<text top="436" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Dontos fumbled in his pouch and drew out a silvery spider-web, dangling it between his thick </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">fingers. It was a hair net of fine-spun silver, the strands so thin and delicate the net seemed to </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">weigh no more than a breath of air when Sansa took it in her fingers. Small gems were set </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="615" height="15" font="1">wherever two strands crossed, so dark they drank the moonlight. “What stones are these?” </text>
<text top="519" left="171" width="545" height="15" font="1">“Black amethysts from Asshai. The rarest kind, a deep true purple by daylight.” </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="545" height="15" font="1">“It’s very lovely,” Sansa said, thinking, <i>It is a ship I need, not a net for my hair.</i> </text>
<text top="569" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Lovelier than you know, sweet child. It’s magic, you see. It’s justice you hold. It’s </text>

<text top="734" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon stared at the platter of oakcakes, honey, and blood sausage they’d brought him to </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">break his fast. Another sleepless night had left his nerves raw, and the very sight of food </text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="392" height="15" font="1">sickened him. “There has been no reply from my uncle?” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="403" height="15" font="1">“None,” the maester said. “Nor from your father on Pyke.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="135" height="15" font="1">“Send more birds.” </text>
<text top="848" left="171" width="334" height="15" font="1">“It will not serve. By the time the birds reach—” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Send them!</i>” Knocking the platter of food aside with a swipe of his arm, he pushed off </text>
<text top="893" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the blankets and rose from Ned Stark’s bed naked and angry. “Or do you want me dead? Is </text>

<text top="937" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">The small grey man was unafraid. “My order serves.” </text>

<text top="988" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The realm,” Maester Luwin said, “and Winterfell. Theon, once I taught you sums and </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon stooped to scoop a puddled cloak off the floor, shook off the rushes, and draped it </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">over his shoulders. <i>A fire, I’ll have a fire, and clean garb. Where’s Wex? I’ll not go to my </i></text>

<text top="168" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“You have no hope of holding here,” the maester went on. “If your lord father meant to </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">send you aid, he would have done so by now. It is the Neck that concerns him. The battle for </text>

<text top="271" left="139" width="600" height="15" font="5"><i>warcraft as you think, old man.</i> “I have food enough to stand a year’s siege, if need be.” </text>

<text top="405" left="171" width="123" height="15" font="1">“There is a way.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I am ironborn,” Theon reminded him. “I have my own way. What choice have they left </text>

<text top="514" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">For a moment he thought the maester was going to defy him. But finally Luwin bowed </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">stiffly. “As you command.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">They made a pitifully small assembly; the ironmen were few, the yard large. “The </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">northmen will be on us before nightfall,” he told them. “Ser Rodrik Cassel and all the lords </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">who have come to his call. I will not run from them. I took this castle and I mean to hold it, to </text>

<text top="656" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">free.” He unsheathed his longsword and drew a line in the dirt. “Those who would stay and </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="141" height="15" font="1">fight, step forward.” </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No one spoke. The men stood in their mail and fur and boiled leather, as still as if they </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were made of stone. A few exchanged looks. Urzen shuffled his feet. Dykk Harlaw hawked </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="402" height="15" font="1">and spat. A finger of wind ruffled Endehar’s long fair hair. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Theon felt as though he were drowning. <i>Why am I surprised?</i> he thought bleakly. His </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">father had forsaken him, his uncles, his sister, even that wretched creature Reek. Why should </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his men prove any more loyal? There was nothing to say, nothing to do. He could only stand </text>

<text top="995" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Stygg had the grace at least to look ashamed. The rest moved off without a word. Theon </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">turned to the seventeen who remained. “Back to the walls. If the gods should spare us, I shall </text>

<text top="174" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">“Put them out,” said Lorren. “Every one.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="306" height="15" font="1">Theon shook his head. “Is the noose ready?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="189" height="15" font="1">“It is. You mean to use it?” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“Do you know a better way?” </text>
<text top="274" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Aye. I’ll take my axe and stand on that drawbridge, and let them come try me. One at a </text>

<text top="389" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Wex helped garb him for battle. Beneath his black surcoat and golden mantle was a shirt </text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of well-oiled ringmail, and under that a layer of stiff boiled leather. Once armed and armored, </text>

<text top="447" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">together to have a look at his doom. The northmen were spreading out to encircle the castle. It </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">was hard to judge their numbers. A thousand at least; perhaps twice that many. <i>Against </i></text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>seventeen.</i> They’d brought catapults and scorpions. He saw no siege towers rumbling up the </text>

<text top="692" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="5"><i>Turncloak.</i> The name was bitter as bile. He had gone to Pyke to lead his father’s </text>
<text top="711" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">longships against Lannisport, he remembered. “I shall be out shortly,” he shouted down. </text>

<text top="756" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Black Lorren disapproved. “Only blood can wash out blood,” he declared. “Knights may </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">keep their truces with other knights, but they are not so careful of their honor when dealing </text>

<text top="865" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">Black Lorren gave him a murderous look. “Aye, Prince.” </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>He’s turned against me too</i>, Theon realized. Of late it seemed to him as if the very stones </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of Winterfell had turned against him. <i>If I die, I die friendless and abandoned.</i> What choice did </text>

<text top="124" left="139" width="557" height="15" font="1">could sense the boys watching from the empty sockets where their eyes had been. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik waited in the market astride his dappled gelding. Beside him, the direwolf of </text>

<text top="296" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My own grief is that I must wait a while to hang you.” The old knight spat onto the </text>

<text top="341" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I am a Greyjoy of Pyke,” Theon reminded him. “The cloak my father swaddled me in </text>

<text top="386" left="171" width="322" height="15" font="1">“For ten years you have been a ward of Stark.” </text>

<text top="436" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Then perhaps Lord Eddard should have kept you chained to a dungeon wall. Instead he </text>

<text top="519" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I came out to parley, not to suffer your insults. Say what you have to say, old man. What </text>

<text top="564" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Two things,” the old man said. “Winterfell, and your life. Command your men to open </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the gates and lay down their arms. Those who murdered no children shall be free to walk </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">away, but you shall be held for King Robb’s justice. May the gods take pity on you when he </text>

<text top="647" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Robb will never look on Winterfell again,” Theon promised. “He will break himself on </text>

<text top="711" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“You hold three castles,” replied Ser Rodrik, “and this one I mean to take back, </text>

<text top="756" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon ignored that. “Here are <i>my</i> terms. You have until evenfall to disperse. Those who </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">swear fealty to Balon Greyjoy as their king and to myself as Prince of Winterfell will be </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">confirmed in their rights and properties and suffer no harm. Those who defy us will be </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="82" height="15" font="1">destroyed.” </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="405" height="15" font="1">Young Cerwyn was incredulous. “Are you mad, Greyjoy?” </text>
<text top="865" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik shook his head. “Only vain, lad. Theon has always had too lofty an opinion of </text>
<text top="884" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">himself, I fear.” The old man jabbed a finger at him. “Do not imagine that I need wait for </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Robb to fight his way up the Neck to deal with the likes of you. I have near two thousand men </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="448" height="15" font="1">with me . . . and if the tales be true, you have no more than fifty.” </text>
<text top="948" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="5"><i>Seventeen, in truth.</i> Theon made himself smile. “I have something better than men.” And </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="551" height="15" font="1">he raised a fist over his head, the signal Black Lorren had been told to watch for. </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The walls of Winterfell were behind him, but Ser Rodrik faced them squarely and could </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">not fail to see. Theon watched his face. When his chin quivered under those stiff white </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">whiskers, he knew just what the old man was seeing. <i>He is not surprised</i>, he thought with </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="516" height="15" font="1">“This is craven,” Ser Rodrik said. “To use a child so . . . this is despicable.” </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh, I know,” said Theon. “It’s a dish I tasted myself, or have you forgotten? I was ten </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">when I was taken from my father’s house, to make certain he would raise no more rebellions.” </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="141" height="15" font="1">“<i>It is not the same!</i>” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Theon’s face was impassive. “The noose I wore was not made of hempen rope, that’s </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">true enough, but I felt it all the same. And it chafed, Ser Rodrik. It chafed me raw.” He had </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">never quite realized that until now, but as the words came spilling out he saw the truth of </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="42" height="15" font="1">them. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="214" height="15" font="1">“No harm was ever done you.” </text>
<text top="308" left="171" width="391" height="15" font="1">“And no harm will be done your Beth, so long as you—” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik never gave him the chance to finish. “<i>Viper</i>,” the knight declared, his face red </text>
<text top="352" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">with rage beneath those white whiskers. “I gave you the chance to save your men and die with </text>
<text top="372" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">some small shred of honor, Turncloak. I should have known that was too much to ask of a </text>
<text top="391" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">childkiller.” His hand went to the hilt of his sword. “I ought cut you down here and now and </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">put an end to your lies and deceits. By the gods, I should.” </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Theon did not fear a doddering old man, but those watching archers and that line of </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knights were a different matter. If the swords came out his chances of getting back to the </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">castle alive were small to none. “Forswear your oath and murder me, and you will watch your </text>

<text top="519" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Ser Rodrik’s knuckles had gone white, but after a moment he took his hand off the </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="282" height="15" font="1">swordhilt. “Truly, I have lived too long.” </text>
<text top="564" left="171" width="361" height="15" font="1">“I will not disagree, ser. Will you accept my terms?” </text>
<text top="589" left="171" width="341" height="15" font="1">“I have a duty to Lady Catelyn and House Stark.” </text>
<text top="614" left="171" width="377" height="15" font="1">“And your own House? Beth is the last of your blood.” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The old knight drew himself up straight. “I offer myself in my daughter’s place. Release </text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">her, and take me as your hostage. Surely the castellan of Winterfell is worth more than a </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="50" height="15" font="1">child.” </text>
<text top="703" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Not to me.” <i>A valiant gesture, old man, but I am not that great a fool.</i> “Not to Lord </text>
<text top="723" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Manderly or Leobald Tallhart either, I’d wager.” <i>Your sorry old skin is worth no more to them </i></text>
<text top="742" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>than any other man’s.</i> “No, I’ll keep the girl . . . and keep her safe, so long as you do as I’ve </text>
<text top="762" left="139" width="301" height="15" font="1">commanded you. Her life is in your hands.” </text>
<text top="787" left="171" width="596" height="15" font="1">“Gods be good, Theon, how can you do this? You know I must attack, have <i>sworn</i> . . .” </text>
<text top="812" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“If this host is still in arms before my gate when the sun sets, Beth will hang,” said </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Theon. “Another hostage will follow her to the grave at first light, and another at sunset. </text>
<text top="851" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">Every dawn and every dusk will mean a death, until you are gone. I have no lack of hostages.” </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He did not wait for a reply, but wheeled Smiler around and rode back toward the castle. He </text>
<text top="890" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">went slowly at first, but the thought of those archers at his back soon drove him to a canter. </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The small heads watched him come from their spikes, their tarred and flayed faces looming </text>
<text top="929" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">larger with every yard; between them stood little Beth Cassel, noosed and crying. Theon put </text>
<text top="948" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his heel into Smiler and broke into a hard gallop. Smiler’s hooves clattered on the drawbridge, </text>
<text top="968" left="139" width="109" height="15" font="1">like drumbeats. </text>
<text top="993" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">In the yard he dismounted and handed his reins to Wex. “It may stay them,” he told </text>
<text top="1012" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Black Lorren. “We’ll know by sunset. Take the girl in till then, and keep her somewhere </text>
<text top="1032" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">safe.” Under the layers of leather, steel, and wool, he was slick with sweat. “I need a cup of </text>
<text top="1051" left="139" width="297" height="15" font="1">wine. A vat of wine would do even better.” </text>
</page>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A fire had been laid in Ned Stark’s bedchamber. Theon sat beside it and filled a cup with </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">a heavy-bodied red from the castle vaults, a wine as sour as his mood. <i>They will attack</i>, he </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought gloomily, staring at the flames. <i>Ser Rodrik loves his daughter, but he is still castellan, </i></text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>and most of all a knight.</i> Had it been Theon with a noose around his neck and Lord Balon </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">commanding the army without, the warhorns would already have sounded the attack, he had </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">no doubt. He should thank the gods that Ser Rodrik was not ironborn. The men of the green </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="608" height="15" font="1">lands were made of softer stuff, though he was not certain they would prove soft enough. </text>
<text top="246" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">If not, if the old man gave the command to storm the castle regardless, Winterfell would </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fall; Theon entertained no delusions on that count. His seventeen might kill three, four, five </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="467" height="15" font="1">times their own number, but in the end they would be overwhelmed. </text>
<text top="310" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon stared at the flames over the rim of his wine goblet, brooding on the injustice of it </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">all. “I rode beside Robb Stark in the Whispering Wood,” he muttered. He had been frightened </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">that night, but not like this. It was one thing to go into battle surrounded by friends, and </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="458" height="15" font="1">another to perish alone and despised. <i>Mercy</i>, he thought miserably. </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">When the wine brought no solace, Theon sent Wex to fetch his bow and took himself to </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the old inner ward. There he stood, loosing shaft after shaft at the archery butts until his </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">shoulders ached and his fingers were bloody, pausing only long enough to pull the arrows </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">from the targets for another round. <i>I saved Bran’s life with this bow</i>, he reminded himself. </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Would that I could save my own.</i> Women came to the well, but did not linger; whatever they </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="313" height="15" font="1">saw on Theon’s face sent them away quickly. </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Behind him the broken tower stood, its summit as jagged as a crown where fire had </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">collapsed the upper stories long ago. As the sun moved, the shadow of the tower moved as </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">well, gradually lengthening, a black arm reaching out for Theon Greyjoy. By the time the sun </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">touched the wall, he was in its grasp. <i>If I hang the girl, the northmen will attack at once</i>, he </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">thought as he loosed a shaft. <i>If I do not hang her, they will know my threats are empty.</i> He </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="423" height="15" font="1">knocked another arrow to his bow. <i>There is no way out, none.</i> </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“If you had a hundred archers as good as yourself, you might have a chance to hold the </text>

<text top="683" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When he turned, Maester Luwin was behind him. “Go away,” Theon told him. “I have </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="204" height="15" font="1">had enough of your counsel.” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“And life? Have you had enough of that, my lord prince?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="537" height="15" font="1">He raised the bow. “One more word and I’ll put this shaft through your heart.” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="96" height="15" font="1">“You won’t.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Theon bent the bow, drawing the grey goose feathers back to his cheek. “Care to make a </text>

<text top="848" left="171" width="206" height="15" font="1">“I am your last hope, Theon.” </text>
<text top="873" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="5"><i>I have no hope</i>, he thought. Yet he lowered the bow half an inch and said, “I will not </text>

<text top="917" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“I do not speak of running. Take the black.” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The Night’s Watch?” Theon let the bow unbend slowly and pointed the arrow at the </text>

<text top="271" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">He felt a sudden sick sense of dread. “Is it the attack?” </text>
<text top="296" left="171" width="530" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin clutched his arm. “There’s still time. Raise a peace banner—” </text>

<text top="519" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin trailed after him. By the time they reached the battlements, dead men and </text>
<text top="539" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dying horses were strewn about the market square outside the gates. He saw no battle lines, </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">only a swirling chaos of banners and blades. Shouts and screams rang through the cold </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">autumn air. Ser Rodrik seemed to have the numbers, but the Dreadfort men were better led, </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and had taken the others unawares. Theon watched them charge and wheel and charge again, </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">chopping the larger force to bloody pieces every time they tried to form up between the </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">houses. He could hear the crash of iron axeheads on oaken shields over the terrified </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="416" height="15" font="1">trumpeting of a maimed horse. The inn was burning, he saw. </text>
<text top="681" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Black Lorren appeared beside him and stood silently for a time. The sun was low in the </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">west, painting the fields and houses all a glowing red. A thin wavering cry of pain drifted over </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the walls, and a warhorn sounded off beyond the burning houses. Theon watched a wounded </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">man drag himself painfully across the ground, smearing his life’s blood in the dirt as he </text>
<text top="759" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">struggled to reach the well that stood at the center of the market square. He died before he got </text>
<text top="778" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">there. He wore a leather jerkin and conical half-helm, but no badge to tell which side he’d </text>
<text top="798" left="139" width="74" height="15" font="1">fought on. </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The crows came in the blue dust, with the evening stars. “The Dothraki believe the stars </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="640" height="15" font="1">are spirits of the valiant dead,” Theon said. Maester Luwin had told him that, a long time ago. </text>
<text top="867" left="171" width="87" height="15" font="1">“Dothraki?” </text>
<text top="892" left="171" width="274" height="15" font="1">“The horselords across the narrow sea.” </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Oh. Them.” Black Lorren frowned through his beard. “Savages believe all manner of </text>

<text top="962" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">As the night grew darker and the smoke spread it was harder to make out what was </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">happening below, but the din of steel gradually diminished to nothing, and the shouts and </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">warhorns gave way to moans and piteous wailing. Finally a column of mounted men rode out </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of the drifting smoke. At their head was a knight in dark armor. His rounded helm gleamed a </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sullen red, and a pale pink cloak streamed from his shoulders. Outside the main gate he reined </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="366" height="15" font="1">up, and one of his men shouted for the castle to open. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="377" height="15" font="1">“Are you friend or foe?” Black Lorren bellowed down. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Would a foe bring such fine gifts?” Red Helm waved a hand, and three corpses were </text>
<text top="149" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dumped in front of the gates. A torch was waved above the bodies, so the defenders upon the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="257" height="15" font="1">walls might see the faces of the dead. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“The old castellan,” said Black Lorren. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“With Leobald Tallhart and Cley Cerwyn.” The boy lord had taken an arrow in the eye, </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and Ser Rodrik had lost his left arm at the elbow. Maester Luwin gave a wordless cry of </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="469" height="15" font="1">dismay, turned away from the battlements, and fell to his knees sick. </text>
<text top="282" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The great pig Manderly was too craven to leave White Harbor, or we would have </text>

<text top="327" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>I am saved</i>, Theon thought. So why did he feel so empty? This was victory, sweet </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">victory, the deliverance he had prayed for. He glanced at Maester Luwin. <i>To think how close I </i></text>

<text top="391" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Open the gates for our friends.” Perhaps tonight Theon would sleep without fear of what </text>
<text top="411" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">his dreams might bring. </text>
<text top="436" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The Dreadfort men made their way across the moat and through the inner gates. Theon </text>
<text top="455" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">descended with Black Lorren and Maester Luwin to meet them in the yard. Pale red pennons </text>
<text top="475" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">trailed from the ends of a few lances, but many more carried battle-axes and greatswords and </text>
<text top="494" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shields hacked half to splinters. “How many men did you lose?” Theon asked Red Helm as he </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">dismounted. </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Twenty or thirty.” The torchlight glittered off the chipped enamel of his visor. His helm </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and gorget were wrought in the shape of a man’s face and shoulders, skinless and bloody, </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="272" height="15" font="1">mouth open in a silent howl of anguish. </text>
<text top="603" left="171" width="235" height="15" font="1">“Ser Rodrik had you five-to-one.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Aye, but he thought us friends. A common mistake. When the old fool gave me his </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">hand, I took half his arm instead. Then I let him see my face.” The man put both hands to his </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="441" height="15" font="1">helm and lifted it off his head, holding it in the crook of his arm. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="527" height="15" font="1">“Reek,” Theon said, disquieted. <i>How did a serving man get such fine armor?</i> </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The man laughed. “The wretch is dead.” He stepped closer. “The girl’s fault. If she had </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not run so far, his horse would not have lamed, and we might have been able to flee. I gave </text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">him mine when I saw the riders from the ridge. I was done with her by then, and he liked to </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">take his turn while they were still warm. I had to pull him off her and shove my clothes into </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his hands—calfskin boots and velvet doublet, silver-chased swordbelt, even my sable cloak. </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Ride for the Dreadfort, I told him, bring all the help you can. Take my horse, he’s swifter, and </text>

<text top="853" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">better than to question me. By the time they put that arrow through his back, I’d smeared </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">myself with the girl’s filth and dressed in his rags. They might have hanged me anyway, but it </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was the only chance I saw.” He rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth. “And now, my </text>

<text top="976" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Theon had given his word. This was not the time to flinch. <i>Pay him his pound of flesh </i></text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="621" height="15" font="5"><i>and deal with him later.</i> “Harrag,” he said, “go to the kennels and bring Palla out for . . . ?” </text>
<text top="1020" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ramsay.” There was a smile on his plump lips, but none in those pale pale eyes. “Snow, </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">my wife called me before she ate her fingers, but I say Bolton.” His smile curdled. “So you’d </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There was a tone in his voice Theon did not like, no more than he liked the insolent way </text>

<text top="149" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“She smells of dogshit. I’ve had enough of bad smells, as it happens. I think I’ll have </text>

<text top="193" left="171" width="374" height="15" font="1">“Are you mad?” Theon said angrily. “I’ll have you—” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Bastard’s backhand caught him square, and his cheekbone shattered with a sickening </text>

<text top="263" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Sometime later, Theon found himself on the ground. He rolled onto his stomach and </text>

<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">of mail and sharp swords. There was a ringing in his ears, and horror all around him. Black </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Lorren had his sword out, but there were already four of them pressing in on him. He saw Ulf </text>

<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">then swung back to ride over him. Another man whipped a torch round and round his head </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and then lofted it toward the thatched roof of the stables. “<i>Save me the Freys</i>,” the Bastard </text>

<text top="720" left="139" width="620" height="15" font="1">He listened to the blasphemies and wondered if he was dying. After a time the room faded. </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He found himself outside the city, walking through a world without color. Ravens soared </text>

<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">live without a mouth? He began to run. The city was not far. He would be safe inside the city, </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">away from all these dead. He did not belong with the dead. He had no mouth, but he was still </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">a living man. <i>No, a lion, a lion, and alive.</i> But when he reached the city walls, the gates were </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="119" height="15" font="1">shut against him. </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">It was dark when he woke again. At first he could see nothing, but after a time the vague </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">outlines of a bed appeared around him. The drapes were drawn, but he could see the shape of </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">carved bedposts, and the droop of the velvet canopy over his head. Under him was the </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">yielding softness of a featherbed, and the pillow beneath his head was goose down. <i>My own </i></text>
<text top="408" left="139" width="340" height="15" font="5"><i>bed, I am in my own bed, in my own bedchamber.</i> </text>
<text top="433" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It was warm inside the drapes, under the great heap of furs and blankets that covered </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him. He was sweating. <i>Fever</i>, he thought groggily. He felt so weak, and the pain stabbed </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through him when he struggled to lift his hand. He gave up the effort. His head felt enormous, </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as big as the bed, too heavy to raise from the pillow. His body he could scarcely feel at all. </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>How did I come here?</i> He tried to remember. The battle came back in fits and flashes. The </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="580" height="15" font="1">fight along the river, the knight who’d offered up his gauntlet, the bridge of ships . . . </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>Ser Mandon.</i> He saw the dead empty eyes, the reaching hand, the green fire shining </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">against the white enamel plate. Fear swept over him in a cold rush; beneath the sheets he </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">could feel his bladder letting go. He would have cried out, if he’d had a mouth. <i>No, that was </i></text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>the dream</i>, he thought, his head pounding. <i>Help me, someone help me. Jaime, Shae, Mother, </i></text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="159" height="15" font="5"><i>someone . . . Tysha . . .</i> </text>
<text top="658" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">No one heard. No one came. Alone in the dark, he fell back into piss-scented sleep. He </text>
<text top="678" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dreamed his sister was standing over his bed, with their lord father beside her, frowning. It </text>
<text top="697" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had to be a dream, since Lord Tywin was a thousand leagues away, fighting Robb Stark in the </text>
<text top="717" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">west. Others came and went as well. Varys looked down on him and sighed, but Littlefinger </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">made a quip. <i>Bloody treacherous bastard</i>, Tyrion thought venomously, <i>we sent you to </i></text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>Bitterbridge and you never came back.</i> Sometimes he could hear them talking to one another, </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but he did not understand the words. Their voices buzzed in his ears like wasps muffled in </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="69" height="15" font="1">thick felt. </text>
<text top="819" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He wanted to ask if they’d won the battle. <i>We must have, else I’d be a head on a spike </i></text>
<text top="839" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>somewhere. If I live, we won.</i> He did not know what pleased him more: the victory, or the fact </text>
<text top="858" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">he had been able to reason it out. His wits were coming back to him, however slowly. That </text>
<text top="878" left="139" width="245" height="15" font="1">was good. His wits were all he had. </text>
<text top="903" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The next time he woke, the draperies had been pulled back, and Podrick Payne stood </text>
<text top="923" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">over him with a candle. When he saw Tyrion open his eyes he ran off. <i>No, don’t go, help me, </i></text>
<text top="942" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>help</i>, he tried to call, but the best he could do was a muffled moan. <i>I have no mouth.</i> He raised </text>
<text top="961" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">a hand to his face, his every movement pained and fumbling. His fingers found stiff cloth </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">where they should have found flesh, lips, teeth. <i>Linen.</i> The lower half of his face was </text>
<text top="1000" left="139" width="562" height="15" font="1">bandaged tightly, a mask of hardened plaster with holes for breathing and feeding. </text>
<text top="1025" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A short while later Pod reappeared. This time a stranger was with him, a maester chained </text>
<text top="1045" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and robed. “My lord, you must be still,” the man murmured. “You are grievous hurt. You will </text>
<text top="1064" left="139" width="290" height="15" font="1">do yourself great injury. Are you thirsty?” </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He managed an awkward nod. The maester inserted a curved copper funnel through the </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">feeding hole over his mouth and poured a slow trickle down his throat. Tyrion swallowed, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">scarcely tasting. Too late he realized the liquid was milk of the poppy. By the time the </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="571" height="15" font="1">maester removed the funnel from his mouth, he was already spiraling back to sleep. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">This time he dreamed he was at a feast, a victory feast in some great hall. He had a high </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">seat on the dais, and men were lifting their goblets and hailing him as hero. Marillion was </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">there, the singer who’d journeyed with them through the Mountains of the Moon. He played </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his woodharp and sang of the Imp’s daring deeds. Even his father was smiling with approval. </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">When the song was over, Jaime rose from his place, commanded Tyrion to kneel, and touched </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him first on one shoulder and then on the other with his golden sword, and he rose up a </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">knight. Shae was waiting to embrace him. She took him by the hand, laughing and teasing, </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="236" height="15" font="1">calling him her giant of Lannister. </text>
<text top="349" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">He woke in darkness to a cold empty room. The draperies had been drawn again. </text>
<text top="368" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Something felt wrong, turned around, though he could not have said what. He was alone once </text>
<text top="388" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">more. Pushing back the blankets, he tried to sit, but the pain was too much and he soon </text>
<text top="407" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">subsided, breathing raggedly. His face was the least part of it. His right side was one huge </text>
<text top="427" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ache, and a stab of pain went through his chest whenever he lifted his arm. <i>What’s happened </i></text>
<text top="446" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>to me?</i> Even the battle seemed half a dream when he tried to think back on it. <i>I was hurt more </i></text>
<text top="466" left="139" width="242" height="15" font="5"><i>badly than I knew. Ser Mandon . . .</i> </text>
<text top="491" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The memory frightened him, but Tyrion made himself hold it, turn it in his head, stare at </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">it hard. <i>He tried to kill me, no mistake. That part was not a dream. He would have cut me in </i></text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="290" height="15" font="5"><i>half if Pod had not . . . Pod, where’s Pod?</i> </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Gritting his teeth, he grabbed hold of the bed hangings and yanked. The drapes ripped </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">free of the canopy overhead and tumbled down, half on the rushes and half on him. Even that </text>
<text top="594" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">small effort had dizzied him. The room whirled around him, all bare walls and dark shadows, </text>
<text top="613" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with a single narrow window. He saw a chest he’d owned, an untidy pile of his clothing, his </text>
<text top="633" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">battered armor. <i>This is not my bedchamber</i>, he realized. <i>Not even the Tower of the Hand.</i> </text>
<text top="652" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Someone had moved him. His shout of anger came out as a muffled moan. <i>They have moved </i></text>
<text top="672" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>me here to die</i>, he thought as he gave up the struggle and closed his eyes once more. The </text>
<text top="691" left="139" width="315" height="15" font="1">room was dank and cold, and he was burning. </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He dreamed of a better place, a snug little cottage by the sunset sea. The walls were </text>
<text top="736" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">lopsided and cracked and the floor had been made of packed earth, but he had always been </text>
<text top="755" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">warm there, even when they let the fire go out. <i>She used to tease me about that</i>, he </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remembered. <i>I never thought to feed the fire, that had always been a servant’s task.</i> “We have </text>
<text top="794" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">no servants,” she would remind me, and I would say, “You have me, I’m your servant,” and </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">she would say, “A lazy servant. What do they do with lazy servants in Casterly Rock, my </text>
<text top="833" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">lord?” and he would tell her, “They kiss them.” That would always make her giggle. “They do </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">not neither. They beat them, I bet,” she would say, but he would insist, “No, they kiss them, </text>
<text top="872" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">just like this.” He would show her how. “They kiss their fingers first, every one, and they kiss </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">their wrists, yes, and inside their elbows. Then they kiss their funny ears, all our servants have </text>
<text top="911" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">funny ears. Stop laughing! And they kiss their cheeks and they kiss their noses with the little </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bump in them, there, so, like that, and they kiss their sweet brows and their hair and their lips, </text>
<text top="950" left="139" width="275" height="15" font="1">their . . . mmmm . . . mouths . . . so . . .” </text>
<text top="975" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They would kiss for hours, and spend whole days doing no more than lolling in bed, </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">listening to the waves, and touching each other. Her body was a wonder to him, and she </text>
<text top="1014" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">seemed to find delight in his. Sometimes she would sing to him. <i>I loved a maid as fair as </i></text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>summer, with sunlight in her hair.</i> “I love you, Tyrion,” she would whisper before they went </text>
<text top="1053" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">to sleep at night. “I love your lips. I love your voice, and the words you say to me, and how </text>
<text top="1073" left="139" width="262" height="15" font="1">you treat me gentle. I love your face.” </text>

<text top="263" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>my lady of the lie.</i> Her face seemed to fade away, dissolving behind a veil of tears, but even </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">after she was gone he could still hear the faint, far-off sound of her voice, calling his name. </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">“. . . my lord, can you hear me? My lord? Tyrion? My lord? My lord?” </text>
<text top="327" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Through a haze of poppied sleep, he saw a soft pink face leaning over him. He was back </text>
<text top="347" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">in the dank room with the torn bed hangings, and the face was wrong, not hers, too round, </text>
<text top="366" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with a brown fringe of beard. “Do you thirst, my lord? I have your milk, your good milk. You </text>
<text top="386" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">must not fight, no, don’t try to move, you need your rest.” He had the copper funnel in one </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="277" height="15" font="1">damp pink hand and a flask in the other. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">As the man leaned close, Tyrion’s fingers slid underneath his chain of many metals, </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">grabbed, pulled. The maester dropped the flask, spilling milk of the poppy all over the </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">blanket. Tyrion twisted until he could feel the links digging into the flesh of the man’s fat </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="548" height="15" font="1">neck. “No. More,” he croaked, so hoarse he was not certain he had even spoken. </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">But he must have, for the maester choked out a reply. “Unhand, please, my lord . . . need </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="385" height="15" font="1">your milk, the pain . . . the chain, don’t, unhand, no . . .” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The pink face was beginning to purple when Tyrion let go. The maester reeled back, </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sucking in air. His reddened throat showed deep white gouges where the links had pressed. </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">His eyes were white too. Tyrion raised a hand to his face and made a ripping motion over the </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="268" height="15" font="1">hardened mask. And again. And again. </text>
<text top="642" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“You . . . you want the bandages off, is that it?” the maester said at last. “But I’m not </text>

<text top="706" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The mention of his sister made Tyrion growl. <i>Are you one of hers, then?</i> He pointed a </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">finger at the maester, then coiled his hand into a fist. Crushing, choking, a promise, unless the </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="157" height="15" font="1">fool did as he was bid. </text>
<text top="770" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Thankfully, he understood. “I . . . I will do as my lord commands, to be sure, but . . . this </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="197" height="15" font="1">is unwise, your wounds . . .” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="184" height="15" font="1">“<i>Do. It.</i>” Louder that time. </text>
<text top="840" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bowing, the man left the room, only to return a few moments later, bearing a long knife </text>
<text top="859" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">with a slender saw-tooth blade, a basin of water, a pile of soft cloths, and several flasks. By </text>
<text top="879" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">then Tyrion had managed to squirm backward a few inches, so he was half-sitting against his </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pillow. The maester bade him be very still as he slid the tip of the knife in under his chin, </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beneath the mask. <i>A slip of the hand here, and Cersei will be free of me</i>, he thought. He could </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="534" height="15" font="1">feel the blade sawing through the stiffened linen, only inches above his throat. </text>
<text top="962" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Fortunately this soft pink man was not one of his sister’s braver creatures. After a </text>
<text top="981" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">moment he felt cool air on his cheeks. There was pain as well, but he did his best to ignore </text>
<text top="1001" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that. The maester discarded the bandages, still crusty with potion. “Be still now, I must wash </text>
<text top="1020" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">out the wound.” His touch was gentle, the water warm and soothing. <i>The wound</i>, Tyrion </text>
<text top="1040" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">thought, remembering a sudden flash of bright silver that seemed to pass just below his eyes. </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“This is like to sting some,” the maester warned as he wet a cloth with wine that smelled of </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crushed herbs. It did more than sting. It traced a line of fire all the way across Tyrion’s face, </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and twisted a burning poker up his nose. His fingers clawed the bedclothes and he sucked in </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his breath, but somehow he managed not to scream. The maester was clucking like an old hen. </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">“It would have been wiser to leave the mask in place until the flesh had knit, my lord. Still, it </text>

<text top="260" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the limb, but we treated it with boiling wine and maggots, and now it seems to be healing </text>

<text top="304" left="171" width="312" height="15" font="1">“Name,” Tyrion breathed up at him. “<i>Name.</i>” </text>
<text top="330" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The maester blinked. “Why, you are Tyrion Lannister, my lord. Brother to the queen. Do </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="408" height="15" font="1">you remember the battle? Sometimes with head wounds—” </text>
<text top="374" left="171" width="600" height="15" font="1">“<i>Your</i> name.” His throat was raw, and his tongue had forgotten how to shape the words. </text>
<text top="399" left="171" width="174" height="15" font="1">“I am Maester Ballabar.” </text>
<text top="424" left="171" width="388" height="15" font="1">“Ballabar,” Tyrion repeated. “Bring me. Looking glass.” </text>
<text top="450" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“My lord,” the maester said, “I would not counsel . . . that might be, ah, unwise, as it </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="181" height="15" font="1">were . . . your wound . . .” </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“<i>Bring</i> it,” he had to say. His mouth was stiff and sore, as if a punch had split his lip. </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="212" height="15" font="1">“And drink. <i>Wine.</i> No poppy.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The maester rose flush-faced and hurried off. He came back with a flagon of pale amber </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">wine and a small silvered looking glass in an ornate golden frame. Sitting on the edge of the </text>
<text top="578" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bed, he poured half a cup of wine and held it to Tyrion’s swollen lips. The trickle went down </text>
<text top="597" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">cool, though he could hardly taste it. “<i>More</i>,” he said when the cup was empty. Maester </text>
<text top="617" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Ballabar poured again. By the end of the second cup, Tyrion Lannister felt strong enough to </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="93" height="15" font="1">face his face. </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He turned over the glass, and did not know whether he ought to laugh or cry. The gash </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">was long and crooked, starting a hair under his left eye and ending on the right side of his jaw. </text>
<text top="700" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Three-quarters of his nose was gone, and a chunk of his lip. Someone had sewn the torn flesh </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">together with catgut, and their clumsy stitches were still in place across the seam of raw, red, </text>
<text top="739" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">half-healed flesh. “<i>Pretty</i>,” he croaked, flinging the glass aside. </text>
<text top="764" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He remembered now. The bridge of boats, Ser Mandon Moore, a hand, a sword coming </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at his face. <i>If I had not pulled back, that cut would have taken off the top of my head.</i> Jaime </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">had always said that Ser Mandon was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard, because his dead </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">empty eyes gave no hint to his intentions. <i>I should never have trusted any of them.</i> He’d </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">known that Ser Meryn and Ser Boros were his sister’s, and Ser Osmund later, but he had let </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">himself believe that the others were not wholly lost to honor. <i>Cersei must have paid him to </i></text>

<text top="901" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="5"><i>know of.</i> Tyrion touched his face, plucking at the proud flesh with blunt thick fingers. <i>Another </i></text>

<text top="945" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The maester stood beside the bed like a goose about to take flight. “My lord, there, there </text>

<text top="990" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>Most like?</i>” His snort of laughter turned into a wince of pain. There would be a scar, to </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">be sure. Nor was it likely that his nose would be growing back any time soon. It was not as if </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">his face had ever been fit to look at. “Teach me, not to, play with, axes.” His grin felt tight. </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="626" height="15" font="1">“Where, are we? What, what place?” It hurt to talk, but Tyrion had been too long in silence. </text>

<text top="589" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“As you will, my lord.” Maester Ballabar bobbed his head and hurried out. Tyrion could </text>
<text top="608" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">feel the strength seeping out of him as he waited. He wondered how long he had been here, </text>
<text top="628" left="139" width="484" height="15" font="1">asleep. <i>Cersei would have me sleep forever, but I won’t be so obliging.</i> </text>
<text top="653" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Podrick Payne entered the bedchamber timid as a mouse. “My lord?” He crept close to </text>
<text top="673" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the bed. <i>How can a boy so bold in battle be so frightened in a sickroom?</i> Tyrion wondered. “I </text>

<text top="756" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">glance at Tyrion’s face, and just as quickly averted his eyes. <i>Well, I cannot blame him for </i></text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="522" height="15" font="5"><i>that.</i> “I want,” Tyrion went on, “mine own. Guard. Bronn. Where’s Bronn?” </text>
<text top="801" left="171" width="189" height="15" font="1">“They made him a knight.” </text>
<text top="826" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">Even frowning hurt. “Find him. Bring him.” </text>

<text top="876" left="171" width="311" height="15" font="1">Tyrion seized the lad’s wrist. “Ser Mandon?” </text>
<text top="901" left="171" width="340" height="15" font="1">The boy flinched. “I n-never meant to k-k-k-k—” </text>

<text top="1002" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">By the time his squire left, the last of Tyrion’s strength was gone as well. He lay back </text>

<text top="154" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When Qhorin Halfhand told him to find some brush for a fire, Jon knew their end was </text>
<text top="174" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">near. </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="5"><i>It will be good to feel warm again, if only for a little while</i>, he told himself while he </text>
<text top="218" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">hacked bare branches from the trunk of a dead tree. Ghost sat on his haunches watching, silent </text>
<text top="238" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">as ever. <i>Will he howl for me when I’m dead, as Bran’s wolf howled when he fell?</i> Jon </text>
<text top="257" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wondered. <i>Will Shaggydog howl, far off in Winterfell, and Grey Wind and Nymeria, wherever </i></text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="5"><i>they might be?</i> </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The moon was rising behind one mountain and the sun sinking behind another as Jon </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">struck sparks from flint and dagger, until finally a wisp of smoke appeared. Qhorin came and </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stood over him as the first flame rose up flickering from the shavings of bark and dead dry </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">pine needles. “As shy as a maid on her wedding night,” the big ranger said in a soft voice, </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="472" height="15" font="1">“and near as fair. Sometimes a man forgets how pretty a fire can be.” </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">He was not a man you’d expect to speak of maids and wedding nights. So far as Jon </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">knew, Qhorin had spent his whole life in the Watch. <i>Did he ever love a maid or have a </i></text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>wedding?</i> He could not ask. Instead he fanned the fire. When the blaze was all a-crackle, he </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">peeled off his stiff gloves to warm his hands, and sighed, wondering if ever a kiss had felt as </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">good. The warmth spread through his fingers like melting butter. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The Halfhand eased himself to the ground and sat cross-legged by the fire, the flickering </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">light playing across the hard planes of his face. Only the two of them remained of the five </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="630" height="15" font="1">rangers who had fled the Skirling Pass, back into the blue-grey wilderness of the Frostfangs. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">At first Jon had nursed the hope that Squire Dalbridge would keep the wildlings bottled </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">up in the pass. But when they’d heard the call of a far-off horn every man of them knew the </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">squire had fallen. Later they spied the eagle soaring through the dusk on great blue-grey </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wings and Stonesnake unslung his bow, but the bird flew out of range before he could so </text>
<text top="650" left="139" width="529" height="15" font="1">much as string it. Ebben spat and muttered darkly of wargs and skinchangers. </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They glimpsed the eagle twice more the day after, and heard the hunting horn behind </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them echoing against the mountains. Each time it seemed a little louder, a little closer. When </text>
<text top="714" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">night fell, the Halfhand told Ebben to take the squire’s garron as well as his own, and ride east </text>
<text top="733" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for Mormont with all haste, back the way they had come. The rest of them would draw off the </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="456" height="15" font="1">pursuit. “Send Jon,” Ebben had urged. “He can ride as fast as me.” </text>
<text top="778" left="171" width="229" height="15" font="1">“Jon has a different part to play.” </text>
<text top="803" left="171" width="160" height="15" font="1">“He is half a boy still.” </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="379" height="15" font="1">“No,” said Qhorin, “he is a man of the Night’s Watch.” </text>
<text top="853" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">When the moon rose, Ebben parted from them. Stonesnake went east with him a short </text>
<text top="873" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">way, then doubled back to obscure their tracks, and the three who remained set off toward the </text>
<text top="892" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">southwest. </text>
<text top="917" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After that the days and nights blurred one into the other. They slept in their saddles and </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stopped only long enough to feed and water the garrons, then mounted up again. Over bare </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rock they rode, through gloomy pine forests and drifts of old snow, over icy ridges and across </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">shallow rivers that had no names. Sometimes Qhorin or Stonesnake would loop back to sweep </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">away their tracks, but it was a futile gesture. They were watched. At every dawn and every </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">dusk they saw the eagle soaring between the peaks, no more than a speck in the vastness of </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="57" height="15" font="1">the sky. </text>
</page>
<page number="500" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">They were scaling a low ridge between two snowcapped peaks when a shadowcat came </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">snarling from its lair, not ten yards away. The beast was gaunt and half-starved, but the sight </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of it sent Stonesnake’s mare into a panic; she reared and ran, and before the ranger could get </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="525" height="15" font="1">her back under control she had stumbled on the steep slope and broken a leg. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Ghost ate well that day, and Qhorin insisted that the rangers mix some of the garron’s </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blood with their oats, to give them strength. The taste of that foul porridge almost choked Jon, </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">but he forced it down. They each cut a dozen strips of raw stringy meat from the carcass to </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="396" height="15" font="1">chew on as they rode, and left the rest for the shadowcats. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">There was no question of riding double. Stonesnake offered to lay in wait for the pursuit </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and surprise them when they came. Perhaps he could take a few of them with him down to </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hell. Qhorin refused. “If any man in the Night’s Watch can make it through the Frostfangs </text>
<text top="330" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">alone and afoot, it is you, brother. You can go over mountains that a horse must go around. </text>
<text top="349" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Make for the Fist. Tell Mormont what Jon saw, and how. Tell him that the old powers are </text>
<text top="369" left="139" width="619" height="15" font="1">waking, that he faces giants and wargs and worse. Tell him that the trees have eyes again.” </text>
<text top="394" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="5"><i>He has no chance</i>, Jon thought when he watched Stonesnake vanish over a snow-covered </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="459" height="15" font="1">ridge, a tiny black bug crawling across a rippling expanse of white. </text>
<text top="438" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">After that, every night seemed colder than the night before, and more lonely. Ghost was </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not always with them, but he was never far either. Even when they were apart, Jon sensed his </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">nearness. He was glad for that. The Halfhand was not the most companionable of men. </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Qhorin’s long grey braid swung slowly with the motion of his horse. Often they would ride </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">for hours without a word spoken, the only sounds the soft scrape of horseshoes on stone and </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the keening of the wind, which blew endlessly through the heights. When he slept, he did not </text>
<text top="555" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">dream; not of wolves, nor his brothers, nor anything. <i>Even dreams cannot live up here</i>, he told </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="59" height="15" font="1">himself. </text>
<text top="600" left="171" width="571" height="15" font="1">“Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?” asked Qhorin Halfhand across the flickering fire. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="400" height="15" font="1">“My sword is Valyrian steel. The Old Bear gave it to me.” </text>
<text top="650" left="171" width="308" height="15" font="1">“Do you remember the words of your vow?” </text>
<text top="675" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yes.” They were not words a man was like to forget. Once said, they could never be </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="272" height="15" font="1">unsaid. They changed your life forever. </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="262" height="15" font="1">“Say them again with me, Jon Snow.” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“If you like.” Their voices blended as one beneath the rising moon, while Ghost listened </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and the mountains themselves bore witness. “Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the </text>
<text top="823" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that </text>
<text top="842" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.” </text>
<text top="887" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When they were done, there was no sound but the faint crackle of the flames and a </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">distant sigh of wind. Jon opened and closed his burnt fingers, holding tight to the words in his </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">mind, praying that his father’s gods would give him the strength to die bravely when his hour </text>
<text top="945" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">came. It would not be long now. The garrons were near the end of their strength. Qhorin’s </text>
<text top="965" left="139" width="338" height="15" font="1">mount would not last another day, Jon suspected. </text>
<text top="990" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The flames were burning low by then, the warmth fading. “The fire will soon go out,” </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="482" height="15" font="1">Qhorin said, “but if the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.” </text>
<text top="1034" left="171" width="360" height="15" font="1">There was nothing Jon could say to that. He nodded. </text>
<text top="1059" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">“We may escape them yet,” the ranger said. “Or not.” </text>

<page number="501" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="307" height="15" font="1">“I’m not afraid to die.” It was only half a lie. </text>
<text top="129" left="171" width="247" height="15" font="1">“It may not be so easy as that, Jon.” </text>
<text top="154" left="171" width="314" height="15" font="1">He did not understand. “What do you mean?” </text>
<text top="180" left="171" width="234" height="15" font="1">“If we are taken, you must yield.” </text>
<text top="205" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Yield?” He blinked in disbelief. The wildlings did not make captives of the men they </text>
<text top="224" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">called the crows. They killed them, except for . . . “They only spare oathbreakers. Those who </text>

<text top="269" left="171" width="82" height="15" font="1">“And you.” </text>
<text top="294" left="171" width="300" height="15" font="1">“No.” He shook his head. “Never. I won’t.” </text>
<text top="319" left="171" width="230" height="15" font="1">“You will. I command it of you.” </text>
<text top="344" left="171" width="164" height="15" font="1">“<i>Command</i> it? But . . .” </text>
<text top="369" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Our honor means no more than our lives, so long as the realm is safe. Are you a man of </text>

<text top="414" left="171" width="93" height="15" font="1">“Yes, but—” </text>
<text top="439" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“There is no <i>but</i>, Jon Snow. You are, or you are not.” </text>
<text top="464" left="171" width="185" height="15" font="1">Jon sat up straight. “I am.” </text>
<text top="489" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Then hear me. If we are taken, you will go over to them, as the wildling girl you </text>

<text top="612" left="171" width="162" height="15" font="1">“For what?” Jon asked. </text>
<text top="637" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Would that I knew,” said Qhorin. “Your wolf saw their diggings in the valley of the </text>
<text top="656" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Milkwater. What did they seek, in such a bleak and distant place? Did they find it? That is </text>
<text top="676" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">what you must learn, before you return to Lord Mormont and your brothers. That is the duty I </text>
<text top="695" left="139" width="162" height="15" font="1">lay on you, Jon Snow.” </text>
<text top="720" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I’ll do as you say,” Jon said reluctantly, “but . . . you will tell them, won’t you? The Old </text>
<text top="740" left="139" width="400" height="15" font="1">Bear, at least? You’ll tell him that I never broke my oath.” </text>
<text top="765" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Qhorin Halfhand gazed at him across the fire, his eyes lost in pools of shadow. “When I </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="598" height="15" font="1">see him next. I swear it.” He gestured at the fire. “More wood. I want it bright and hot.” </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Jon went to cut more branches, snapping each one in two before tossing it into the </text>
<text top="829" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">flames. The tree had been dead a long time, but it seemed to live again in the fire, as fiery </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dancers woke within each stick of wood to whirl and spin in their glowing gowns of yellow, </text>
<text top="868" left="139" width="113" height="15" font="1">red, and orange. </text>
<text top="893" left="171" width="336" height="15" font="1">“Enough,” Qhorin said abruptly. “Now we ride.” </text>
<text top="918" left="171" width="514" height="15" font="1">“Ride?” It was dark beyond the fire, and the night was cold. “Ride where?” </text>
<text top="943" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Back.” Qhorin mounted his weary garron one more time. “The fire will draw them past, </text>
<text top="963" left="139" width="165" height="15" font="1">I hope. Come, brother.” </text>
<text top="988" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Jon pulled on his gloves again and raised his hood. Even the horses seemed reluctant to </text>
<text top="1007" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">leave the fire. The sun was long gone, and only the cold silver shine of the half-moon </text>
<text top="1027" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">remained to light their way over the treacherous ground that lay behind them. He did not </text>
<text top="1046" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">know what Qhorin had in mind, but perhaps it was a chance. He hoped so. <i>I do not want to </i></text>
<text top="1066" left="139" width="301" height="15" font="5"><i>play the oathbreaker, even for good reason.</i> </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">They went cautiously, moving as silent as man and horse could move, retracing their </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">steps until they reached the mouth of a narrow defile where an icy little stream emerged from </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">between two mountains. Jon remembered the place. They had watered the horses here before </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">the sun went down. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“The water’s icing up,” Qhorin observed as he turned aside, “else we’d ride in the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">streambed. But if we break the ice, they are like to see. Keep close to the cliffs. There’s a </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">crook a half mile on that will hide us.” He rode into the defile. Jon gave one last wistful look </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="231" height="15" font="1">to their distant fire, and followed. </text>
<text top="271" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The farther in they went, the closer the cliffs pressed to either side. They followed the </text>
<text top="291" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">moonlit ribbon of stream back toward its source. Icicles bearded its stony banks, but Jon could </text>
<text top="310" left="139" width="436" height="15" font="1">still hear the sound of rushing water beneath the thin hard crust. </text>
<text top="335" left="171" width="608" height="15" font="1">A great jumble of fallen rock blocked their way partway up, where a section of the cliff-</text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">face had fallen, but the surefooted little garrons were able to pick their way through. Beyond, </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the walls pinched in sharply, and the stream led them to the foot of a tall twisting waterfall. </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The air was full of mist, like the breath of some vast cold beast. The tumbling waters shone </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">silver in the moonlight. Jon looked about in dismay. <i>There is no way out.</i> He and Qhorin </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">might be able to climb the cliffs, but not with the horses. He did not think they would last </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">long afoot. </text>
<text top="477" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Quickly now,” the Halfhand commanded. The big man on the small horse rode over the </text>
<text top="497" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ice-slick stones, right into the curtain of water, and vanished. When he did not reappear, Jon </text>
<text top="516" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">put his heels into his horse and went after. His garron did his best to shy away. The falling </text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="641" height="15" font="1">water slapped at them with frozen fists, and the shock of the cold seemed to stop Jon’s breath. </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="405" height="15" font="1">Then he was through; drenched and shivering, but through. </text>
<text top="586" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The cleft in the rock was barely large enough for man and horse to pass, but beyond, the </text>
<text top="605" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">walls opened up and the floor turned to soft sand. Jon could feel the spray freezing in his </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beard. Ghost burst through the waterfall in an angry rush, shook droplets from his fur, sniffed </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">at the darkness suspiciously, then lifted a leg against one rocky wall. Qhorin had already </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="435" height="15" font="1">dismounted. Jon did the same. “You knew this place was here.” </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“When I was no older than you, I heard a brother tell how he followed a shadowcat </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">through these falls.” He unsaddled his horse, removed her bit and bridle, and ran his fingers </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">through her shaggy mane. “There is a way through the heart of the mountain. Come dawn, if </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">they have not found us, we will press on. The first watch is mine, brother.” Qhorin seated </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">himself on the sand, his back to a wall, no more than a vague black shadow in the gloom of </text>
<text top="786" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the cave. Over the rush of falling waters, Jon heard a soft sound of steel on leather that could </text>
<text top="806" left="139" width="346" height="15" font="1">only mean that the Halfhand had drawn his sword. </text>
<text top="831" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He took off his wet cloak, but it was too cold and damp here to strip down any further. </text>
<text top="850" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">Ghost stretched out beside him and licked his glove before curling up to sleep. Jon was </text>
<text top="870" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">grateful for his warmth. He wondered if the fire was still burning outside, or if it had gone out </text>
<text top="889" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">by now. <i>If the Wall should ever fall, all the fires will go out.</i> The moon shone through the </text>
<text top="909" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">curtain of falling water to lay a shimmering pale stripe across the sand, but after a time that </text>
<text top="928" left="139" width="172" height="15" font="1">too faded and went dark. </text>
<text top="953" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Sleep came at last, and with it nightmares. He dreamed of burning castles and dead men </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">rising unquiet from their graves. It was still dark when Qhorin woke him. While the Halfhand </text>
<text top="992" left="139" width="626" height="15" font="1">slept, Jon sat with his back to the cave wall, listening to the water and waiting for the dawn. </text>
<text top="1017" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">At break of day, they each chewed a half-frozen strip of horsemeat, then saddled their </text>
<text top="1037" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">garrons once again, and fastened their black cloaks around their shoulders. During his watch </text>
<text top="1056" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the Halfhand had made a half-dozen torches, soaking bundles of dry moss with the oil he </text>
</page>
<page number="503" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">carried in his saddlebag. He lit the first one now and led the way down into the dark, holding </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">the pale flame up before him. Jon followed with the horses. The stony path twisted and </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">turned, first down, then up, then down more steeply. In spots it grew so narrow it was hard to </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">convince the garrons they could squeeze through. <i>By the time we come out we will have lost </i></text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>them</i>, he told himself as they went. <i>Not even an eagle can see through solid stone. We will </i></text>
<text top="202" left="139" width="577" height="15" font="5"><i>have lost them, and we will ride hard for the Fist, and tell the Old Bear all we know.</i> </text>
<text top="227" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But when they emerged back into the light long hours later, the eagle was waiting for </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">them, perched on a dead tree a hundred feet up the slope. Ghost went bounding up the rocks </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="387" height="15" font="1">after it, but the bird flapped its wings and took to the air. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="440" height="15" font="1">Qhorin’s mouth tightened as he followed its flight with his eyes. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Here is as good a place as any to make a stand,” he declared. “The mouth of the cave </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shelters us from above, and they cannot get behind us without passing through the mountain. </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="228" height="15" font="1">Is your sword sharp, Jon Snow?” </text>
<text top="380" left="171" width="106" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” he said. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="441" height="15" font="1">“We’ll feed the horses. They’ve served us bravely, poor beasts.” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jon gave his garron the last of the oats and stroked his shaggy mane while Ghost prowled </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">restlessly amongst the rocks. He pulled his gloves on tighter and flexed his burnt fingers. <i>I am </i></text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="281" height="15" font="5"><i>the shield that guards the realms of men.</i> </text>
<text top="494" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">A hunting horn echoed through the mountains, and a moment later Jon heard the baying </text>
<text top="514" left="139" width="593" height="15" font="1">of hounds. “They will be with us soon,” announced Qhorin. “Keep your wolf in hand.” </text>
<text top="539" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Ghost, to me,” Jon called. The direwolf returned reluctantly to his side, tail held stiffly </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="85" height="15" font="1">behind him. </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The wildlings came boiling over a ridge not half a mile away. Their hounds ran before </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">them, snarling grey-brown beasts with more than a little wolf in their blood. Ghost bared his </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">teeth, his fur bristling. “Easy,” Jon murmured. “Stay.” Overhead he heard a rustle of wings. </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="446" height="15" font="1">The eagle landed on an outcrop of rock and screamed in triumph. </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The hunters approached warily, perhaps fearing arrows. Jon counted fourteen, with eight </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">dogs. Their large round shields were made of skins stretched over woven wicker and painted </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with skulls. About half of them hid their faces behind crude helms of wood and boiled leather. </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">On either wing, archers notched shafts to the strings of small wood-and-horn bows, but did </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">not loose. The rest seemed to be armed with spears and mauls. One had a chipped stone axe. </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">They wore only what bits of armor they had looted from dead rangers or stolen during raids. </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Wildlings did not mine or smelt, and there were few smiths and fewer forges north of the </text>
<text top="803" left="139" width="41" height="15" font="1">Wall. </text>
<text top="828" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Qhorin drew his longsword. The tale of how he had taught himself to fight with his left </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">hand after losing half of his right was part of his legend; it was said that he handled a blade </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">better now than he ever had before. Jon stood shoulder to shoulder with the big ranger and </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="558" height="15" font="1">pulled Longclaw from its sheath. Despite the chill in the air, sweat stung his eyes. </text>
<text top="912" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ten yards below the cave mouth the hunters halted. Their leader came on alone, riding a </text>
<text top="931" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beast that seemed more goat than horse, from the surefooted way it climbed the uneven slope. </text>
<text top="951" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">As man and mount grew nearer Jon could hear them clattering; both were armored in bones. </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Cow bones, sheep bones, the bones of goats and aurochs and elk, the great bones of the hairy </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="284" height="15" font="1">mammoths . . . and human bones as well. </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="310" height="15" font="1">“Rattleshirt,” Qhorin called down, icy-polite. </text>
<text top="1040" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“To crows I be the Lord o’ Bones.” The rider’s helm was made from the broken skull of </text>
<text top="1059" left="139" width="575" height="15" font="1">a giant, and all up and down his arms bearclaws had been sewn to his boiled leather. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Qhorin snorted. “I see no lord. Only a dog dressed in chickenbones, who rattles when he </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="49" height="15" font="1">rides.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The wildling hissed in anger, and his mount reared. He <i>did</i> rattle, Jon could hear it; the </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">bones were strung together loosely, so they clacked and clattered when he moved. “It’s <i>your</i> </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">bones I’ll be rattling soon, Halfhand. I’ll boil the flesh off you and make a byrnie from your </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="592" height="15" font="1">ribs. I’ll carve your teeth to cast me runes, and eat me oaten porridge from your skull.” </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="279" height="15" font="1">“If you want my bones, come get them.” </text>
<text top="257" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">That, Rattleshirt seemed reluctant to do. His numbers meant little in the close confines of </text>
<text top="277" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the rocks where the black brothers had taken their stand; to winkle them out of the cave the </text>
<text top="296" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wildlings would need to come up two at a time. But another of his company edged a horse up </text>
<text top="316" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">beside him, one of the fighting women called <i>spearwives</i>. “We are four-and-ten to two, crows, </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="475" height="15" font="1">and eight dogs to your wolf,” she called. “Fight or run, you are ours.” </text>
<text top="360" left="171" width="266" height="15" font="1">“Show them,” commanded Rattleshirt. </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The woman reached into a bloodstained sack and drew out a trophy. Ebben had been bald </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="488" height="15" font="1">as an egg, so she dangled the head by an ear. “He died brave,” she said. </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“But he died,” said Rattleshirt, “same like you.” He freed his battleaxe, brandishing it </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">above his head. Good steel it was, with a wicked gleam to both blades; Ebben was never a </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">man to neglect his weapons. The other wildlings crowded forward beside him, yelling taunts. </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="650" height="15" font="1">A few chose Jon for their mockery. “Is that your wolf, boy?” a skinny youth called, </text>
<text top="508" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">unlimbering a stone flail. “He’ll be my cloak before the sun is down.” On the other side of the </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">line, another spearwife opened her ragged furs to show Jon a heavy white breast. “Does the </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="581" height="15" font="1">baby want his momma? Come, have a suck o’ this, boy.” The dogs were barking too. </text>
<text top="572" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“They would shame us into folly.” Qhorin gave Jon a long look. “Remember your </text>
<text top="592" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">orders.” </text>
<text top="617" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“Belike we need to flush the crows,” Rattleshirt bellowed over the clamor. “Feather </text>
<text top="636" left="139" width="51" height="15" font="1">them!” </text>
<text top="661" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“<i>No!</i>” The word burst from Jon’s lips before the bowmen could loose. He took two quick </text>
<text top="681" left="139" width="187" height="15" font="1">steps forward. “We yield!” </text>
<text top="706" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“They warned me bastard blood was craven,” he heard Qhorin Halfhand say coldly </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="425" height="15" font="1">behind him. “I see it is so. Run to your new masters, coward.” </text>
<text top="750" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Face reddening, Jon descended the slope to where Rattleshirt sat his horse. The wildling </text>
<text top="770" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">stared at him through the eyeholes of his helm, and said, “The free folk have no need of </text>
<text top="789" left="139" width="68" height="15" font="1">cravens.” </text>
<text top="814" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“He is no craven.” One of the archers pulled off her sewn sheepskin helm and shook out </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="624" height="15" font="1">a head of shaggy red hair. “This is the Bastard o’ Winterfell, who spared me. Let him live.” </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">Jon met Ygritte’s eyes, and had no words. </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Let him die,” insisted the Lord of Bones. “The black crow is a tricksy bird. I trust him </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="38" height="15" font="1">not.” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="605" height="15" font="1">On a rock above them, the eagle flapped its wings and split the air with a scream of fury. </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“The bird hates you, Jon Snow,” said Ygritte. “And well he might. He was a man, before </text>
<text top="973" left="139" width="115" height="15" font="1">you killed him.” </text>
<text top="998" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“I did not know,” said Jon truthfully, trying to remember the face of the man he had slain </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">in the pass. “You told me Mance would take me.” </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="191" height="15" font="1">“And he will,” Ygritte said. </text>
<text top="1068" left="171" width="399" height="15" font="1">“Mance is not here,” said Rattleshirt. “Ragwyle, gut him.” </text>

<page number="505" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The big spearwife narrowed her eyes and said, “If the crow would join the free folk, let </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="367" height="15" font="1">him show us his prowess and prove the truth of him.” </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="470" height="15" font="1">“I’ll do whatever you ask.” The words came hard, but Jon said them. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Rattleshirt’s bone armor clattered loudly as he laughed. “Then kill the Halfhand, </text>
<text top="193" left="139" width="65" height="15" font="1">bastard.” </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="368" height="15" font="1">“As if he could,” said Qhorin. “<i>Turn</i>, Snow, and die.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">And then Qhorin’s sword was coming at him and somehow Longclaw leapt upward to </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">block. The force of impact almost knocked the bastard blade from Jon’s hand, and sent him </text>
<text top="282" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">staggering backward. <i>You must not balk, whatever is asked of you.</i> He shifted to a two-hand </text>
<text top="302" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">grip, quick enough to deliver a stroke of his own, but the big ranger brushed it aside with </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">contemptuous ease. Back and forth they went, black cloaks swirling, the youth’s quickness </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">against the savage strength of Qhorin’s left-hand cuts. The Halfhand’s longsword seemed to </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">be everywhere at once, raining down from one side and then the other, driving him where he </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="543" height="15" font="1">would, keeping him off balance. Already he could feel his arms growing numb. </text>
<text top="405" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Even when Ghost’s teeth closed savagely around the ranger’s calf, somehow Qhorin kept </text>
<text top="424" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his feet. But in that instant, as he twisted, the opening was there. Jon planted and pivoted. The </text>
<text top="444" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">ranger was leaning away, and for an instant it seemed that Jon’s slash had not touched him. </text>
<text top="463" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Then a string of red tears appeared across the big man’s throat, bright as a ruby necklace, and </text>
<text top="483" left="139" width="378" height="15" font="1">the blood gushed out of him, and Qhorin Halfhand fell. </text>
<text top="508" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Ghost’s muzzle was dripping red, but only the point of the bastard blade was stained, the </text>
<text top="527" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">last half inch. Jon pulled the direwolf away and knelt with one arm around him. The light was </text>
<text top="547" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">already fading in Qhorin’s eyes. “. . . sharp,” he said, lifting his maimed fingers. Then his </text>
<text top="566" left="139" width="189" height="15" font="1">hand fell, and he was gone. </text>
<text top="592" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="5"><i>He knew</i>, he thought numbly. <i>He knew what they would ask of me.</i> He thought of </text>
<text top="611" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Samwell Tarly then, of Grenn and Dolorous Edd, of Pyp and Toad back at Castle Black. Had </text>
<text top="630" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">he lost them all, as he had lost Bran and Rickon and Robb? Who was he now? What was he? </text>
<text top="656" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Get him up.” Rough hands dragged him to his feet. Jon did not resist. “Do you have a </text>
<text top="675" left="139" width="56" height="15" font="1">name?” </text>
<text top="700" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Ygritte answered for him. “His name is Jon Snow. He is Eddard Stark’s blood, of </text>
<text top="720" left="139" width="86" height="15" font="1">Winterfell.” </text>
<text top="745" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">Ragwyle laughed. “Who would have thought it? Qhorin Halfhand slain by some </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="143" height="15" font="1">lordling’s by-blow.” </text>
<text top="789" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Gut him.” That was Rattleshirt, still ahorse. The eagle flew to him and perched atop his </text>
<text top="809" left="139" width="161" height="15" font="1">bony helm, screeching. </text>
<text top="834" left="171" width="260" height="15" font="1">“He yielded,” Ygritte reminded them. </text>
<text top="859" left="171" width="573" height="15" font="1">“Aye, and slew his brother,” said a short homely man in a rust-eaten iron half-helm. </text>
<text top="884" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Rattleshirt rode closer, bones clattering. “The wolf did his work for him. It were foully </text>
<text top="904" left="139" width="273" height="15" font="1">done. The Halfhand’s death was mine.” </text>
<text top="929" left="171" width="430" height="15" font="1">“We all saw how eager you were to take it,” mocked Ragwyle. </text>
<text top="954" left="171" width="469" height="15" font="1">“He is a warg,” said the Lord of Bones, “and a crow. I like him not.” </text>
<text top="979" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“A warg he may be,” Ygritte said, “but that has never frightened us.” Others shouted </text>
<text top="998" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">agreement. Behind the eyeholes of his yellowed skull Rattleshirt’s stare was malignant, but he </text>
<text top="1018" left="139" width="422" height="15" font="1">yielded grudgingly. <i>These are a free folk indeed</i>, thought Jon. </text>
<text top="1043" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They burned Qhorin Halfhand where he’d fallen, on a pyre made of pine needles, brush, </text>
<text top="1063" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and broken branches. Some of the wood was still green, and it burned slow and smoky, </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">sending a black plume up into the bright hard blue of the sky. Afterward Rattleshirt claimed </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="632" height="15" font="1">some charred bones, while the others threw dice for the ranger’s gear. Ygritte won his cloak. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Will we return by the Skirling Pass?” Jon asked her. He did not know if he could face </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="468" height="15" font="1">those heights again, or if his garron could survive a second crossing. </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“No,” she said. “There’s nothing behind us.” The look she gave him was sad. “By now </text>
<text top="213" left="139" width="419" height="15" font="1">Mance is well down the Milkwater, marching on your Wall.” </text>

<text top="313" left="171" width="248" height="15" font="1">The ashes fell like a soft grey snow. </text>
<text top="338" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He padded over dry needles and brown leaves, to the edge of the wood where the pines </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">grew thin. Beyond the open fields he could see the great piles of man-rock stark against the </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">swirling flames. The wind blew hot and rich with the smell of blood and burnt meat, so strong </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="131" height="15" font="1">he began to slaver. </text>
<text top="422" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Yet as one smell drew them onward, others warned them back. He sniffed at the drifting </text>
<text top="441" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">smoke. <i>Men, many men, many horses, and fire, fire, fire.</i> No smell was more dangerous, not </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">even the hard cold smell of iron, the stuff of man-claws and hardskin. The smoke and ash </text>
<text top="480" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">clouded his eyes, and in the sky he saw a great winged snake whose roar was a river of flame. </text>
<text top="500" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">He bared his teeth, but then the snake was gone. Behind the cliffs tall fires were eating up the </text>
<text top="519" left="139" width="40" height="15" font="1">stars. </text>
<text top="544" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">All through the night the fires crackled, and once there was a great roar and a crash that </text>
<text top="564" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">made the earth jump under his feet. Dogs barked and whined and horses screamed in terror. </text>
<text top="583" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Howls shuddered through the night; the howls of the man-pack, wails of fear and wild shouts, </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">laughter and screams. No beast was as noisy as man. He pricked up his ears and listened, and </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his brother growled at every sound. They prowled under the trees as a piney wind blew ashes </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and embers through the sky. In time the flames began to dwindle, and then they were gone. </text>
<text top="661" left="139" width="299" height="15" font="1">The sun rose grey and smoky that morning. </text>
<text top="686" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Only then did he leave the trees, stalking slow across the fields. His brother ran with him, </text>
<text top="706" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">drawn to the smell of blood and death. They padded silent through the dens the men had built </text>
<text top="725" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">of wood and grass and mud. Many and more were burned and many and more were collapsed; </text>
<text top="745" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">others stood as they had before. Yet nowhere did they see or scent a living man. Crows </text>
<text top="764" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blanketed the bodies and leapt into the air screeching when his brother and he came near. The </text>
<text top="784" left="139" width="241" height="15" font="1">wild dogs slunk away before them. </text>
<text top="809" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Beneath the great grey cliffs a horse was dying noisily, struggling to rise on a broken leg </text>
<text top="828" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">and screaming when he fell. His brother circled round him, then tore out his throat while the </text>
<text top="848" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">horse kicked feebly and rolled his eyes. When he approached the carcass his brother snapped </text>
<text top="867" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">at him and laid back his ears, and he cuffed him with a forepaw and bit his leg. They fought </text>
<text top="887" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">amidst the grass and dirt and falling ashes beside the dead horse, until his brother rolled on his </text>
<text top="906" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">back in submission, tail tucked low. One more bite at his upturned throat; then he fed, and let </text>
<text top="926" left="139" width="374" height="15" font="1">his brother feed, and licked the blood off his black fur. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The dark place was pulling at him by then, the house of whispers where all men were </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">blind. He could feel its cold fingers on him. The stony smell of it was a whisper up the nose. </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">He struggled against the pull. He did not like the darkness. He was wolf. He was hunter and </text>
<text top="1009" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stalker and slayer, and he belonged with his brothers and sisters in the deep woods, running </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">free beneath a starry sky. He sat on his haunches, raised his head, and howled. <i>I will not go</i>, </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">he cried. <i>I am wolf, I will not go.</i> Yet even so the darkness thickened, until it covered his eyes </text>

<text top="321" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Winterfell.” His tongue felt strange and thick in his mouth. <i>One day when I come back I </i></text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>won’t know how to talk anymore.</i> “It was Winterfell. It was all on fire. There were horse </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="407" height="15" font="1">smells, and steel, and blood. They killed everyone, Meera.” </text>
<text top="386" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">He felt her hand on his face, stroking back his hair. “You’re all sweaty,” she said. “Do </text>
<text top="405" left="139" width="133" height="15" font="1">you need a drink?” </text>
<text top="430" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“A drink,” he agreed. She held a skin to his lips, and Bran swallowed so fast the water </text>
<text top="450" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">ran out of the corner of his mouth. He was always weak and thirsty when he came back. And </text>
<text top="469" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">hungry too. He remembered the dying horse, the taste of blood in his mouth, the smell of </text>
<text top="488" left="139" width="301" height="15" font="1">burnt flesh in the morning air. “How long?” </text>
<text top="514" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Three days,” said Jojen. The boy had come up soft-foot, or perhaps he had been there all </text>
<text top="533" left="139" width="579" height="15" font="1">along; in this blind black world, Bran could not have said. “We were afraid for you.” </text>
<text top="558" left="171" width="229" height="15" font="1">“I was with Summer,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Too long. You’ll starve yourself. Meera dribbled a little water down your throat, and we </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="361" height="15" font="1">smeared honey on your mouth, but it is not enough.” </text>
<text top="628" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“I ate,” said Bran. “We ran down an elk and had to drive off a treecat that tried to steal </text>
<text top="647" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">him.” The cat had been tan-and-brown, only half the size of the direwolves, but fierce. He </text>
<text top="667" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remembered the musky smell of him, and the way he had snarled down at them from the limb </text>
<text top="686" left="139" width="76" height="15" font="1">of the oak. </text>
<text top="711" left="171" width="550" height="15" font="1">“The wolf ate,” Jojen said. “Not you. Take care, Bran. Remember who you are.” </text>
<text top="736" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">He remembered who he was all too well; Bran the boy, Bran the broken. <i>Better Bran the </i></text>
<text top="756" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="5"><i>beastling.</i> Was it any wonder he would sooner dream his Summer dreams, his wolf dreams? </text>
<text top="775" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Here in the chill damp darkness of the tomb his third eye had finally opened. He could reach </text>
<text top="795" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Summer whenever he wanted, and once he had even touched Ghost and talked to Jon. Though </text>
<text top="814" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">maybe he had only dreamed that. He could not understand why Jojen was always trying to </text>
<text top="834" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">pull him back now. Bran used the strength of his arms to squirm to a sitting position. “I have </text>
<text top="853" left="139" width="386" height="15" font="1">to tell Osha what I saw. Is she here? Where did she go?” </text>
<text top="879" left="171" width="618" height="15" font="1">The wildling woman herself gave answer. “Nowhere, m’lord. I’ve had my fill o’ </text>
<text top="898" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">blundering in the black.” He heard the scrape of a heel on stone, turned his head toward the </text>
<text top="917" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sound, but saw nothing. He thought he could smell her, but he wasn’t sure. All of them stank </text>
<text top="937" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">alike, and he did not have Summer’s nose to tell one from the other. “Last night I pissed on a </text>
<text top="956" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">king’s foot,” Osha went on. “Might be it was morning, who can say? I was sleeping, but now </text>
<text top="976" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">I’m not.” They all slept a lot, not only Bran. There was nothing else to do. Sleep and eat and </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sleep again, and sometimes talk a little . . . but not too much, and only in whispers, just to be </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">safe. Osha might have liked it better if they had never talked at all, but there was no way to </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="629" height="15" font="1">quiet Rickon, or to stop Hodor from muttering, “Hodor, hodor, hodor,” endlessly to himself. </text>

<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“Osha,” Bran said, “I saw Winterfell burning.” Off to his left, he could hear the soft </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="201" height="15" font="1">sound of Rickon’s breathing. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="157" height="15" font="1">“A dream,” said Osha. </text>
<text top="174" left="171" width="549" height="15" font="1">“A wolf dream,” said Bran. “I <i>smelled</i> it too. Nothing smells like fire, or blood.” </text>
<text top="199" left="171" width="117" height="15" font="1">“Whose blood?” </text>
<text top="224" left="171" width="350" height="15" font="1">“Men, horses, dogs, everyone. We have to go <i>see</i>.” </text>
<text top="249" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“This scrawny skin of mine’s the only one I got,” said Osha. “That squid prince catches </text>

<text top="294" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Meera’s hand found Bran’s in the darkness and gave his fingers a squeeze. “I’ll go if </text>
<text top="313" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">you’re afraid.” </text>
<text top="338" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">Bran heard fingers fumbling at leather, followed by the sound of steel on flint. Then </text>
<text top="358" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">again. A spark flew, caught. Osha blew softly. A long pale flame awoke, stretching upward </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">like a girl on her toes. Osha’s face floated above it. She touched the flame with the head of a </text>
<text top="397" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">torch. Bran had to squint as the pitch began to burn, filling the world with orange glare. The </text>
<text top="416" left="139" width="278" height="15" font="1">light woke Rickon, who sat up yawning. </text>
<text top="441" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">When the shadows moved, it looked for an instant as if the dead were rising as well. </text>
<text top="461" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Lyanna and Brandon, Lord Rickard Stark their father, Lord Edwyle his father, Lord Willam </text>

<text top="539" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they came when the warmth had seeped out of their bodies; this was the dark hall of the dead, </text>
<text top="558" left="139" width="221" height="15" font="1">where the living feared to tread. </text>
<text top="583" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">And in the mouth of the empty tomb that waited for Lord Eddard Stark, beneath his </text>
<text top="603" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">stately granite likeness, the six fugitives huddled round their little cache of bread and water </text>
<text top="622" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">and dried meat. “Little enough left,” Osha muttered as she blinked down on their stores. “I’d </text>
<text top="642" left="139" width="545" height="15" font="1">need to go up soon to steal food in any case, or we’d be down to eating Hodor.” </text>
<text top="667" left="171" width="258" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” Hodor said, grinning at her. </text>
<text top="692" left="171" width="508" height="15" font="1">“Is it day or night up there?” Osha wondered. “I’ve lost all count o’ such.” </text>
<text top="717" left="171" width="387" height="15" font="1">“Day,” Bran told her, “but it’s dark from all the smoke.” </text>
<text top="742" left="171" width="141" height="15" font="1">“M’lord is certain?” </text>
<text top="767" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Never moving his broken body, he reached out all the same, and for an instant he was </text>
<text top="787" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">seeing double. There stood Osha holding the torch, and Meera and Jojen and Hodor, and the </text>

<text top="845" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">iron gates charred and askew, the drawbridge down in a tangle of broken chains and missing </text>
<text top="865" left="139" width="389" height="15" font="1">planks. Bodies floated in the moat, islands for the crows. </text>
<text top="890" left="171" width="159" height="15" font="1">“Certain,” he declared. </text>
<text top="915" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Osha chewed on that a moment. “I’ll risk a look then. I want the lot o’ you close behind. </text>
<text top="934" left="139" width="185" height="15" font="1">Meera, get Bran’s basket.” </text>
<text top="960" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Are we going home?” Rickon asked excitedly. “I want my horse. And I want applecakes </text>
<text top="979" left="139" width="492" height="15" font="1">and butter and honey, and Shaggy. Are we going where Shaggydog is?” </text>
<text top="1004" left="171" width="345" height="15" font="1">“Yes,” Bran promised, “but you have to be quiet.” </text>
<text top="1029" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Meera strapped the wicker basket to Hodor’s back and helped lift Bran into it, easing his </text>
<text top="1049" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">useless legs through the holes. He had a queer flutter in his belly. He knew what awaited them </text>

<text top="104" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">one last look, and it seemed to Bran that there was a sadness in Lord Eddard’s eyes, as if he </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="398" height="15" font="1">did not want them to go. <i>We have to</i>, he thought. <i>It’s time.</i> </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Osha carried her long oaken spear in one hand and the torch in the other. A naked sword </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">hung down her back, one of the last to bear Mikken’s mark. He had forged it for Lord </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Eddard’s tomb, to keep his ghost at rest. But with Mikken slain and the ironmen guarding the </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">armory, good steel had been hard to resist, even if it meant grave-robbing. Meera had claimed </text>
<text top="227" left="139" width="649" height="15" font="1">Lord Rickard’s blade, though she complained that it was too heavy. Brandon took his </text>
<text top="246" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">namesake’s, the sword made for the uncle he had never known. He knew he would not be </text>
<text top="265" left="139" width="433" height="15" font="1">much use in a fight, but even so the blade felt good in his hand. </text>
<text top="291" left="171" width="289" height="15" font="1">But it was only a game, and Bran knew it. </text>
<text top="316" left="171" width="619" height="15" font="1">Their footsteps echoed through the cavernous crypts. The shadows behind them </text>
<text top="335" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">swallowed his father as the shadows ahead retreated to unveil other statues; no mere lords, </text>
<text top="355" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">these, but the old Kings in the North. On their brows they wore stone crowns. Torrhen Stark, </text>
<text top="374" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the King Who Knelt. Edwyn the Spring King. Theon Stark, the Hungry Wolf. Brandon the </text>
<text top="394" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">Burner and Brandon the Shipwright. Jorah and Jonos, Brandon the Bad, Walton the Moon </text>
<text top="413" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">King, Edderion the Bridegroom, Eyron, Benjen the Sweet and Benjen the Bitter, King Edrick </text>
<text top="433" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Snowbeard. Their faces were stern and strong, and some of them had done terrible things, but </text>
<text top="452" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">they were Starks every one, and Bran knew all their tales. He had never feared the crypts; they </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">were part of his home and who he was, and he had always known that one day he would lie </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="64" height="15" font="1">here too. </text>
<text top="516" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">But now he was not so certain. <i>If I go up, will I ever come back down? Where will I go </i></text>
<text top="536" left="139" width="83" height="15" font="5"><i>when I die?</i> </text>
<text top="561" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Wait,” Osha said when they reached the twisting stone stairs that led up to the surface, </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and down to the deeper levels where kings more ancient still sat their dark thrones. She </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">handed Meera the torch. “I’ll grope my way up.” For a time they could hear the sound of her </text>
<text top="619" left="139" width="487" height="15" font="1">footfalls, but they grew softer and softer until they faded away entirely. </text>
<text top="644" left="171" width="221" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” said Hodor nervously. </text>
<text top="669" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Bran had told himself a hundred times how much he hated hiding down here in the dark, </text>
<text top="689" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">how much he wanted to see the sun again, to ride his horse through wind and rain. But now </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that the moment was upon him, he was afraid. He’d felt safe in the darkness; when you could </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">not even find your own hand in front of your face, it was easy to believe that no enemies </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">could ever find you either. And the stone lords had given him courage. Even when he could </text>
<text top="767" left="139" width="306" height="15" font="1">not see them, he had known they were there. </text>
<text top="792" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">It seemed a long while before they heard anything again. Bran had begun to fear that </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">something had happened to Osha. His brother was squirming restlessly. “I want to <i>go home!</i>” </text>
<text top="831" left="139" width="104" height="15" font="1">he said loudly. </text>
<text top="856" left="171" width="293" height="15" font="1">Hodor bobbed his head and said, “Hodor.” </text>
<text top="881" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Then they heard the footsteps again, growing louder, and after a few minutes Osha </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="598" height="15" font="1">emerged into the light, looking grim. “Something is blocking the door. I can’t move it.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="273" height="15" font="1">“Hodor can move anything,” said Bran. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="581" height="15" font="1">Osha gave the huge stableboy an appraising look. “Might be he can. Come on, then.” </text>
<text top="976" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The steps were narrow, so they had to climb in single file. Osha led. Behind came Hodor, </text>
<text top="995" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">with Bran crouched low on his back so his head wouldn’t hit the ceiling. Meera followed with </text>
<text top="1015" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the torch, and Jojen brought up the rear, leading Rickon by the hand. Around and around they </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">went, and up and up. Bran thought he could smell smoke now, but perhaps that was only the </text>
<text top="1054" left="139" width="43" height="15" font="1">torch. </text>
</page>
<page number="510" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The door to the crypts was made of ironwood. It was old and heavy, and lay at a slant to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the ground. Only one person could approach it at a time. Osha tried once more when she </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="486" height="15" font="1">reached it, but Bran could see that it was not budging. “Let Hodor try.” </text>
<text top="168" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">They had to pull Bran from his basket first, so he would not get squished. Meera squatted </text>
<text top="188" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">beside him on the steps, one arm thrown protectively across his shoulders, as Osha and Hodor </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="342" height="15" font="1">traded places. “Open the door, Hodor,” Bran said. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">The huge stableboy put both hands flat on the door, pushed, and grunted. “Hodor?” He </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="510" height="15" font="1">slammed a fist against the wood, and it did not so much as jump. “Hodor.” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="325" height="15" font="1">“Use your back,” urged Bran. “And your legs.” </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Turning, Hodor put his back to the wood and shoved. Again. Again. “Hodor!” He put </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">one foot on a higher step so he was bent under the slant of the door and tried to rise. This time </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the wood groaned and creaked. “<i>Hodor!</i>” The other foot came up a step, and Hodor spread his </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">legs apart, braced, and straightened. His face turned red, and Bran could see cords in his neck </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">bulging as he strained against the weight above him. “<i>Hodor hodor hodor hodor hodor </i></text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="5"><i>HODOR!</i>” From above came a dull rumble. Then suddenly the door jerked upward and a </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shaft of daylight fell across Bran’s face, blinding him for a moment. Another shove brought </text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">the sound of shifting stone, and then the way was open. Osha poked her spear through and slid </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">out after it, and Rickon squirmed through Meera’s legs to follow. Hodor shoved the door open </text>
<text top="477" left="139" width="607" height="15" font="1">all the way and stepped to the surface. The Reeds had to carry Bran up the last few steps. </text>
<text top="502" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">The sky was a pale grey, and smoke eddied all around them. They stood in the shadow of </text>
<text top="522" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">the First Keep, or what remained of it. One whole side of the building had torn loose and </text>
<text top="541" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">fallen away. Stone and shattered gargoyles lay strewn across the yard. <i>They fell just where I </i></text>
<text top="561" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="5"><i>did</i>, Bran thought when he saw them. Some of the gargoyles had broken into so many pieces </text>
<text top="580" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">it made him wonder how he was alive at all. Nearby some crows were pecking at a body </text>
<text top="600" left="139" width="633" height="15" font="1">crushed beneath the tumbled stone, but he lay facedown and Bran could not say who he was. </text>
<text top="625" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The First Keep had not been used for many hundreds of years, but now it was more of a </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">shell than ever. The floors had burned inside it, and all the beams. Where the wall had fallen </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">away, they could see right into the rooms, even into the privy. Yet behind, the broken tower </text>
<text top="683" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">still stood, no more burned than before. Jojen Reed was coughing from the smoke. “Take me </text>
<text top="703" left="139" width="332" height="15" font="1">home!” Rickon demanded. “I want to be <i>home!</i>” </text>
<text top="728" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Hodor stomped in a circle. “Hodor,” he whimpered in a small voice. They stood huddled </text>
<text top="747" left="139" width="310" height="15" font="1">together with ruin and death all around them. </text>
<text top="772" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We made noise enough to wake a dragon,” Osha said, “but there’s no one come. The </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">castle’s dead and burned, just as Bran dreamed, but we had best—” She broke off suddenly at </text>
<text top="811" left="139" width="417" height="15" font="1">a noise behind them, and whirled with her spear at the ready. </text>
<text top="836" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Two lean dark shapes emerged from behind the broken tower, padding slowly through </text>
<text top="856" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">the rubble. Rickon gave a happy shout of “<i>Shaggy!</i>” and the black direwolf came bounding </text>
<text top="875" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">toward him. Summer advanced more slowly, rubbed his head up against Bran’s arm, and </text>
<text top="895" left="139" width="106" height="15" font="1">licked his face. </text>
<text top="920" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“We should go,” said Jojen. “So much death will bring other wolves besides Summer and </text>
<text top="939" left="139" width="256" height="15" font="1">Shaggydog, and not all on four feet.” </text>
<text top="965" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aye, soon enough,” Osha agreed, “but we need food, and there may be some survived </text>
<text top="984" left="139" width="473" height="15" font="1">this. Stay together. Meera, keep your shield up and guard our backs.” </text>
<text top="1009" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">It took the rest of the morning to make a slow circuit of the castle. The great granite walls </text>
<text top="1029" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">remained, blackened here and there by fire but otherwise untouched. But within, all was death </text>
<text top="1048" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and destruction. The doors of the Great Hall were charred and smoldering, and inside the </text>
<text top="1068" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">rafters had given way and the whole roof had crashed down onto the floor. The green and </text>

<page number="511" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">yellow panes of the glass gardens were all in shards, the trees and fruits and flowers torn up or </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">left exposed to die. Of the stables, made of wood and thatch, nothing remained but ashes, </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">embers, and dead horses. Bran thought of his Dancer, and wanted to weep. There was a </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shallow steaming lake beneath the Library Tower, and hot water gushing from a crack in its </text>
<text top="182" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">side. The bridge between the Bell Tower and the rookery had collapsed into the yard below, </text>
<text top="201" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">and Maester Luwin’s turret was gone. They saw a dull red glow shining up through the </text>
<text top="221" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">narrow cellar windows beneath the Great Keep, and a second fire still burning in one of the </text>
<text top="240" left="139" width="88" height="15" font="1">storehouses. </text>
<text top="265" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Osha called softly through the blowing smoke as they went, but no one answered. They </text>
<text top="285" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">saw one dog worrying at a corpse, but he ran when he caught the scents of the direwolves; the </text>
<text top="304" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">rest had been slain in the kennels. The maester’s ravens were paying court to some of the </text>
<text top="324" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">corpses, while the crows from the broken tower attended others. Bran recognized Poxy Tym, </text>
<text top="343" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">even though someone had taken an axe to his face. One charred corpse, outside the ashen </text>
<text top="363" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">shell of Mother’s sept, sat with his arms drawn up and his hands balled into hard black fists, </text>
<text top="382" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">as if to punch anyone who dared approach him. “If the gods are good,” Osha said in a low </text>
<text top="402" left="139" width="406" height="15" font="1">angry voice, “the Others will take them that did this work.” </text>
<text top="427" left="171" width="239" height="15" font="1">“It was Theon,” Bran said blackly. </text>
<text top="452" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“No. Look.” She pointed across the yard with her spear. “That’s one of his ironmen. And </text>
<text top="471" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">there. And that’s Greyjoy’s warhorse, see? The black one with the arrows in him.” She moved </text>
<text top="491" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">among the dead, frowning. “And here’s Black Lorren.” He had been hacked and cut so badly </text>
<text top="510" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">that his beard looked a reddish-brown now. “Took a few with him, he did.” Osha turned over </text>
<text top="530" left="139" width="534" height="15" font="1">one of the other corpses with her foot. “There’s a badge. A little man, all red.” </text>
<text top="555" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">“The flayed man of the Dreadfort,” said Bran. </text>
<text top="580" left="171" width="239" height="15" font="1">Summer howled, and darted away. </text>
<text top="605" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“The godswood.” Meera Reed ran after the direwolf, her shield and frog spear to hand. </text>
<text top="625" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">The rest of them trailed after, threading their way through smoke and fallen stones. The air </text>
<text top="644" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">was sweeter under the trees. A few pines along the edge of the wood had been scorched, but </text>
<text top="664" left="139" width="443" height="15" font="1">deeper in the damp soil and green wood had defeated the flames. </text>
<text top="689" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“There is a power in living wood,” said Jojen Reed, almost as if he knew what Bran was </text>
<text top="708" left="139" width="235" height="15" font="1">thinking, “a power strong as fire.” </text>
<text top="733" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">On the edge of the black pool, beneath the shelter of the heart tree, Maester Luwin lay on </text>
<text top="753" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">his belly in the dirt. A trail of blood twisted back through damp leaves where he had crawled. </text>
<text top="772" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Summer stood over him, and Bran thought he was dead at first, but when Meera touched his </text>
<text top="792" left="139" width="192" height="15" font="1">throat, the maester moaned. </text>
<text top="817" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">“Hodor?” Hodor said mournfully. “Hodor?” </text>
<text top="842" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Gently, they eased Luwin onto his back. He had grey eyes and grey hair, and once his </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">robes had been grey as well, but they were darker now where the blood had soaked through. </text>
<text top="881" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Bran,” he said softly when he saw him sitting tall on Hodor’s back. “And Rickon too.” He </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="279" height="15" font="1">smiled. “The gods are good. I knew . . .” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="221" height="15" font="1">“Knew?” said Bran uncertainly. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“The legs, I could tell . . . the clothes fit, but the muscles in his legs . . . poor lad . . .” He </text>
<text top="970" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">coughed, and blood came up from inside him. “You vanished . . . in the woods . . . how, </text>
<text top="990" left="139" width="66" height="15" font="1">though?” </text>
<text top="1015" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“We never went,” said Bran. “Well, only to the edge, and then doubled back. I sent the </text>
<text top="1034" left="139" width="383" height="15" font="1">wolves on to make a trail, but we hid in Father’s tomb.” </text>
</page>
<page number="512" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">“The crypts.” Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on his lips. When the maester tried to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="247" height="15" font="1">move, he gave a sharp gasp of pain. </text>
<text top="149" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">Tears filled Bran’s eyes. When a man was hurt you took him to the maester, but what </text>
<text top="168" left="139" width="295" height="15" font="1">could you do when your maester was hurt? </text>
<text top="193" left="171" width="366" height="15" font="1">“We’ll need to make a litter to carry him,” said Osha. </text>
<text top="218" left="171" width="304" height="15" font="1">“No use,” said Luwin. “I’m dying, woman.” </text>
<text top="243" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">“You  <i>can’t</i>,” said Rickon angrily. “No you can’t.” Beside him, Shaggydog bared his </text>
<text top="263" left="139" width="130" height="15" font="1">teeth and growled. </text>
<text top="288" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">The maester smiled. “Hush now, child, I’m much older than you. I can . . . die as I </text>
<text top="308" left="139" width="58" height="15" font="1">please.” </text>
<text top="333" left="171" width="488" height="15" font="1">“Hodor, down,” said Bran. Hodor went to his knees beside the maester. </text>
<text top="358" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“Listen,” Luwin said to Osha, “the princes . . . Robb’s heirs. Not . . . not together . . . do </text>
<text top="377" left="139" width="78" height="15" font="1">you hear?” </text>
<text top="402" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">The wildling woman leaned on her spear. “Aye. Safer apart. But where to take them? I’d </text>
<text top="422" left="139" width="261" height="15" font="1">thought, might be these Cerwyns . . .” </text>
<text top="447" left="171" width="616" height="15" font="1">Maester Luwin shook his head, though it was plain to see what the effort cost him. </text>
<text top="467" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">“Cerwyn boy’s dead. Ser Rodrik, Leobald Tallhart, Lady Hornwood . . . all slain. Deepwood </text>
<text top="486" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="1">fallen, Moat Cailin, soon Torrhen’s Square. Ironmen on the Stony Shore. And east, the </text>
<text top="505" left="139" width="136" height="15" font="1">Bastard of Bolton.” </text>
<text top="530" left="171" width="193" height="15" font="1">“Then where?” asked Osha. </text>
<text top="556" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“White  Harbor . . . the  Umbers . . . I  do  not  know . . . war  everywhere . . . each  man </text>
<text top="575" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">against  his  neighbor,  and  winter  coming . . . such  folly,  such  black  mad  folly . . .”  Maester </text>
<text top="595" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">Luwin reached up and grasped Bran’s forearm, his fingers closing with a desperate strength. </text>
<text top="614" left="139" width="244" height="15" font="1">“You must be strong now. <i>Strong.</i>” </text>
<text top="639" left="171" width="617" height="15" font="1">“I will be,” Bran said, though it was hard. <i>Ser Rodrik killed and Maester Luwin, </i></text>
<text top="659" left="139" width="160" height="15" font="5"><i>everyone, everyone . . .</i> </text>
<text top="684" left="171" width="574" height="15" font="1">“Good,” the maester said. “A good boy. Your . . . your father’s son, Bran. Now go.” </text>
<text top="709" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Osha gazed up at the weirwood, at the red face carved in the pale trunk. “And leave you </text>
<text top="728" left="139" width="100" height="15" font="1">for the gods?” </text>
<text top="753" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">“I beg . . .” The maester swallowed. “A . . . a drink of water, and . . . another boon. If you </text>
<text top="773" left="139" width="80" height="15" font="1">would . . .” </text>
<text top="798" left="171" width="316" height="15" font="1">“Aye.” She turned to Meera. “Take the boys.” </text>
<text top="823" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">Jojen and Meera led Rickon out between them. Hodor followed. Low branches whipped </text>
<text top="843" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">at Bran’s face as they pushed between the trees, and the leaves brushed away his tears. Osha </text>
<text top="862" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">joined them in the yard a few moments later. She said no word of Maester Luwin. “Hodor </text>
<text top="882" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">must stay with Bran, to be his legs,” the wildling woman said briskly. “I will take Rickon with </text>
<text top="901" left="139" width="37" height="15" font="1">me.” </text>
<text top="926" left="171" width="269" height="15" font="1">“We’ll go with Bran,” said Jojen Reed. </text>
<text top="951" left="171" width="614" height="15" font="1">“Aye, I thought you might,” said Osha. “Believe I’ll try the East Gate, and follow the </text>
<text top="971" left="139" width="134" height="15" font="1">kingsroad a ways.” </text>
<text top="996" left="171" width="302" height="15" font="1">“We’ll take the Hunter’s Gate,” said Meera. </text>
<text top="1021" left="171" width="150" height="15" font="1">“Hodor,” said Hodor. </text>
<text top="1046" left="171" width="612" height="15" font="1">They stopped at the kitchens first. Osha found some loaves of burned bread that were still </text>
<text top="1066" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">edible, and even a cold roast fowl that she ripped in half. Meera unearthed a crock of honey </text>
</page>
<page number="513" position="absolute" top="0" left="0" height="1188" width="918">
<text top="104" left="139" width="647" height="15" font="1">and a big sack of apples. Outside, they made their farewells. Rickon sobbed and clung to </text>
<text top="124" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">Hodor’s leg until Osha gave him a smack with the butt end of her spear. Then he followed her </text>
<text top="143" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">quick enough. Shaggydog stalked after them. The last Bran saw of them was the direwolf’s </text>
<text top="162" left="139" width="296" height="15" font="1">tail as it vanished behind the broken tower. </text>
<text top="188" left="171" width="615" height="15" font="1">The iron portcullis that closed the Hunter’s Gate had been warped so badly by heat it </text>
<text top="207" left="139" width="606" height="15" font="1">could not be raised more than a foot. They had to squeeze beneath its spikes, one by one. </text>
<text top="232" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">“Will we go to your lord father?” Bran asked as they crossed the drawbridge between the </text>
<text top="252" left="139" width="214" height="15" font="1">walls. “To Greywater Watch?” </text>
<text top="277" left="171" width="561" height="15" font="1">Meera looked to her brother for the answer. “Our road is north,” Jojen announced. </text>
<text top="302" left="171" width="613" height="15" font="1">At the edge of the wolfswood, Bran turned in his basket for one last glimpse of the castle </text>
<text top="321" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">that had been his life. Wisps of smoke still rose into the grey sky, but no more than might </text>
<text top="341" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">have risen from Winterfell’s chimneys on a cold autumn afternoon. Soot stains marked some </text>
<text top="360" left="139" width="644" height="15" font="1">of the arrow loops, and here and there a crack or a missing merlon could be seen in the curtain </text>
<text top="380" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">wall, but it seemed little enough from this distance. Beyond, the tops of the keeps and towers </text>
<text top="399" left="139" width="646" height="15" font="1">still stood as they had for hundreds of years, and it was hard to tell that the castle had been </text>
<text top="419" left="139" width="645" height="15" font="1">sacked and burned at all. <i>The stone is strong</i>, Bran told himself, <i>the roots of the trees go deep, </i></text>
<text top="438" left="139" width="648" height="15" font="5"><i>and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones.</i> So long as those remained, </text>
<text top="458" left="139" width="622" height="15" font="1">Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. <i>Like me</i>, he thought. <i>I’m not dead either. </i></text>
